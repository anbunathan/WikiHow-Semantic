To make you look attractive try new clothes that make you look cute or adorable Overall wear clothes that make you feel pretty and comfortable This helps more than you think Wear bright cute clothes if your crush is athletic or something related to that if your crush is goth you probably should wear darker clothes  Find out what he likes maybe you both are interested in the same things However dont join all the same activities as him That would make a guy feel like youre stalking him   How will he ever seem to be interested in you if he never sees you around Strike up a conversation or invite him to join in an activity your participating in or join the one hes doing   Look decent and feel comfortable in what you wear Dont change your style to catch his attention If you try step one and it just doesnt feel right then dont do it After all if it is just a crush then it doesnt really matter because chances are you will eventually find another one   If someone asks how you feel about your crush say Heshes cool I guess not OMG heshes the hottest person around   If you do its going to get around and soon everyone will know When everyone is pressuring your crush it will make him feel uncomfortable and his answer will probably be no
Remind her of something that connected you in the past to test the waters Be confident in your connection and you can ask her a question related to your question as well   For example you could say âHey I saw the Lakers play yesterday and I remember how you like them How have you been Did you see the gameâ   You can still bring up a connection that you have without having to give a reason behind why you texted However donât bring up anything heavy from the past to break the ice   Say something like âHey I have been thinking about you lately and all of our fun conversations last summer How have you beenâ   Because studies show that girls like guys more if they find them funny humor is always a smart way to go when you are talking with girls You can reference an inside joke that you had or ask her a question as a joke   For example say something silly like âHow long has it been since we ate that giant tamaleâ   After you have broke the ice you can ask her questions about how she has been and respond with interest Try to approximately match the length of texts that she sends you and wait time For example donât text her back within a minute with three texts if she answered you with a line or two of text a couple of hours after you texted   Ask follow up questions like âI didnât know that you were working at a new restaurant Thatâs cool How do you like itâ   If she has been responding to your texts with friendly texts back you should ask her if she wants to get together and catch up in person If you ask her to get together suggest an activity that you two could do together   Instead of doing what you have done before try doing new things and going to new places If you usually get together and eat for example try going somewhere new Go to a new neighborhood to eat or make food at your house
Dress in a way that is feminine and flattering Men tend to gravitate towards hourglass figures This means you should accentuate your waist by using a belt or fitted shirt to draw the eye to the waist Wear flowing materials like lace overlays and feminine cuts like the sweatheart neckline Studies show that men also gravitate towards teen girls who wear red  That means no overly complicated twists or braids Instead try a messy casual updo or long flowing curls   Maintain hair with a thick conditioner and a heat protector spray if you curl or straighten your hair often   It should draw his focus to certain features    Lips Full plump lips are attractive to men So try using a light to medium pink to carefully paint your pout  Eyes Big bright eyes can be attractive to men The goal is to line the eyes without drawing too much attention to the make up So instead of overdoing the smokey eye try using white shadow on the corners of the eye and just below the eyebrow then put a thin layer of liquid liner on the top lash line and use a voluminous mascara   This will leave a lasting impression Literally Spray enough perfume for him to smell if he leans in Dont overdo it if you do use rubbing alcohol to remove some of your excess scent      Teeth Get shiny white teeth by using a whitening toothpaste Every five months try using bleaching strips to add a little extra whitening power to your mouth Always use mouthwash after brushing your teeth to prevent any bad breath  Its a myth that you should chew gum in order to freshen your breath This will actually cause your saliva glands to overact worsening your breath Instead try a breath mint    Skin Get bright glowing skin by washing your face every night and by exfoliating once a week This will cause your skin to look fresh and new If you want to add a little color add some bronzer to your routine instead of tanning which can cause damage to your efforts to look cute in front of your ex crush or boyfriend  Body Get smooth and soft legs by using a mens razor instead of a womens razor Use a body scrub that prevents break outs or that has exfoliates in it Your ex boyfriend or crush will think you look cute if you do this for sure
If you canât physically avoid him the next best thing to do is to ignore him If you sit across the room from him in class and he is looking your way donât get caught looking at him when heâs looking at youOf course if he is talking directly to you you donât want to run away or pretend like heâs not there Just play it cool and be polite   If he makes a funny joke avoid laughing at it You like him so youâll want to smile but try to go easy on it for a while You donât want to make it totally obvious and bring more attention to yourself If you canât avoid passing him in your daily routine make the exposure time minimal This way you can remove any opportunity for an awkward conversation or smiling at him If youâre on your way to class you can pretend like you are running late Just keep your head down and walk faster   If you canât walk away from the situation use your body language to deflect his attention If he approaches you at the bus stop give him signs that you are not interested in starting a conversation Keep your arms crossed Donât face his direction  turn your back if you canStay busy with a task even if it is silly such as rearranging some papers so that you appear unavailable and uninterested in what heâs doing
If your pet will be staying at home on its own keep the thermostat at a comfortable temperature for your pet Maintain the thermostat as if you were still at your house Close the doors to any rooms that you do not want your pet to get into Make sure that your pet has a good bed and way to go to the bathroom doggy door or litter box   Leave food and water for your pet in a familiar place   Your home should be safe if you have a pet that roams freely throughout the house Keep trash cans toilets and heatingair vents covered Move any plants that may be poisonous household cleaners medications and chemicals to higher shelves Put away any toys games magazines arts and crafts supplies food and household knickknacks or decorations that may be tempting to your pet   Hide your clothing and shoes from your pet as well   If you must leave your pet alone for a few days use an automatic feeder An automatic feeder will portion out your pets food as many times a day as necessary This will keep your pet from overeating Also some pets such as cats prefer eating fresh foods and would not be happy with a huge bowl of food left out   There are automated feeders for both food and water If you have no one to check on your pet while you are away a pet camera will allow you to monitor your pet Some of these tools will allow you to interact with your pet as wellIf you are unable to purchase a camera there are surveillance apps that are more affordable
Your notsosecret admirer needs to know how you feel but you donât necessarily have to talk in person Confrontation may be too uncomfortable for both of you and itâs often easier to express your feelings when you have time to think about what you want to say Send him an email or write an oldfashioned letter if it makes you more comfortable   A text message can work too Just make sure that you take some time to explain what youâre feeling rather than just sending off a quick text Donât show all your friends your messages or notes especially his responses That could hurt the guyâs feelings If you really need feedback on your wording consult one or two trusted friends   Inconsistency is a surefire way to let the crush linger on so donât talk to him sometimes and then shut him out at other times Avoid sending mixed signals and make sure you stick to your plan to really get the guy out of the pictureBe cordial but not rude when you do see him For example donât go out of your way to talk to him but respond if he talks to you in a group   If you have done your best to avoid the guy and he still wonât leave you alone itâs time to confront the situation head on Tell him kindly that you just really donât have feelings for him Remember that if youâre nice to him heâs likely to be nice to you tooSaying âI think you are really nice but I just donât have feelings for youâ is a good way to let him down gently Donât make excuses for why you donât like him Itâs perfectly fine to admit you just donât feel the same way Honesty is usually the best policyYou donât have to tell him the thought of dating him makes you cringe but donât tell him you donât want to date anyone right now if you plan on finding a boyfriend soon
One tried and true way to get over a past lover is to meet someone new If you feel ready be open to making new connections   For the first few dates avoid bringing up your ex Over time you will be able to talk about her but while it is still fresh it will only prevent you from moving forward   Even if you dont feel ready to date make sure you are spending time with friends Stay connected to your social sphereIts normal to want to be alone after a breakup Do not isolate yourself for too long or it will keep you from moving forward   It will be more difficult to forget about your ex if you continue doing the same things you did when you were together Find new activities that are not associated with her and will allow you to surround yourself with new faces   Explore new bars and restaurants so that you meet a new batch of people There are probably many places you never had the chance to explore while you were together Join a new club or find a new activity that will allow you to make new friends These new friends and activities will distract you from the past They will also share a bond with you that is totally outside of your ex
You cant make someone laugh if theyre not paying any attention to you Make sure you have her attention before you try anything funny such as walking up to her and saying Hello or making eye contact with her   Poking fun at yourself shows you donât take yourself too seriously and thatâs an attractive quality Plus any time you can crack a joke even at your own expense will help to make a girl smile and it can help lighten up any tension in the room that may be the cause of the girls frownThis type of humor works especially well when you do something a little silly or clumsy For instance if you trip over your shoelaces when shes around you could say If only someone had taught me to tie my shoes I wouldnt be in this situation It can also work if she does something clumsy You can take the attention off her by poking fun at yourself For instance you could say That wasnt clumsy Let me tell you about clumsy One time I tripped on my own shoe and went tumbling down the stairs Now THAT was clumsy What you just did was just cute   Cracking a joke shows you have some confidence Not every joke is going to be a winner but just the attempt can make her smile Some of the main ingredients of a good joke include finding the right target having the element of surprise exaggerating everyday life and having the basis of truthThe target refers to what you tell the joke about When telling a joke to someone the target should be relevant to their interests For instance telling a combat joke to a teenage girl may not make much sense since shes likely never been in combat The surprise is the twist to the joke that makes it funny Exaggerating makes it funny because it takes it beyond the every day while still keeping an element of truth For example if youre eating together in the cafeteria try cracking a joke about the food You could say something like This food is so terrible my dog would turn up his nose at it   Even in junior high and high school being silly can make people smile or laugh You can try silly voices or you can attempt an impression of someone famous You could even employ some slapstick humor such as accidentally spraying yourself with the water fountain by holding your thumb over the stream However slapstick could backfire if the girl just finds it ridiculousThink about what makes you or your friends laugh as shell likely find some of the same things funny   Another way to make to make someone laugh is to do a silly dance Of course you dont want to just run up to a girl and start doing a gorilla a dance However if youre standing near her and some music came on you could start doing a silly dance in time to the music
See the image for how this drawing develops stepbystep However there is an important detail the following drawings are to examine it and then to create something unique   Use the lines to create the image shape and sections Fill appeared sections with different patterns ornaments Add text if needed for example NeoPopRealism is 25 Add a colored strip on the top any color you wish  Painting a mural always requires some preparation Youâll need equipment and effort but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed Painting a mural requires a suitable location with the right surface that can be painted  This surface should be smooth and flat However even roughtextured surfaces can be used for your NeoPopRealist mural project   For exterior projects that last for years using a newer 100 acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice For interior walls use latex paints Latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs By measuring the total wall area to be covered the total amount of paint can be calculated but since this mural painting requires two colors  white and black  figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one  Large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer where details may be added with brushes Paints are sensitive to high temperatures humidity direct sunlight however the interior projects do not have many complications In public places keeping the mural protected may require attention For that reason if you make your NeoPopRealist mural dedicated to its 25year anniversary in school or office you can consider using varnish for your mural   See sample above The design will give you a sense of proportion You will have unique requirements and elements Use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject Measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color If the surface is low the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder For higher work you may have to rent a scaffold Mark the horizontal and vertical lines Use white paint as background Then begin marking using your scaled sketch the location of key elements of objects located in the foreground Everything depends on the complexity of your mural If you are confident in your artistic results you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand Be careful keep clean transition edges from one color black to another white However mistakes can be touched up later Always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing An example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes limbs use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns If you have a drip or run paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location Sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred If it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer However if you wont be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brains grays matter youll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse with doodling or socalled zendoodling But to create the NeoPopRealist ART one needs the abilities which can be developed in talented people by studying using Nadia Russ Neopoprealist instructional books Other the copycats selfpromotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission

make people think youre confident Everyone is a little self conscious Make sure you never talk down about yourself and speak up for yourself when you have an opinion Let yourself be in control of situations from time to time and talk to the people you want to talk to   If you want to be noticeable to your crush you have to make everyone else notice you too Get out of the shadows and start by following your passions Do the things that make you happy and do them without feeling worried about what other people think People will admire your dedication and youll be happier to boot   Learn a new skill in order to get people to see just how amazing you really are You can teach yourself to play an instrument or take up another skill like running track or something else Just do something youve always wanted to do   Of course getting people to notice you means that you have to actually talk to people too Get out there and be more social Go to events with your friends make some new friends and get involved in things that are going on   The most important thing is to get up off the couch and start living your life loud and proud If all you do is sit around youre going to be boring to other people as well as your crush   How is your crush supposed to notice you if youre hiding in the shadows all the time Get out there talk with them hang out and let them get to know you This is a great step towards really getting to know each other   Get to know them for who they really are Spend time talking to them about the things that really matter to them such as their dreams for the future and the beliefs about politics or religion This shows them that you really care about them not just who you think they are   Find something to bond over for example if they are in a club join that club Dont fake loving it but learn to appreciate it instead Dont start stalking them though That will only freak them out You just have to be patient and let things develop naturally   Support them in the things they like to do For example if they play sports show up at a game But you should also support them when theyre having a tough time Help them with their homework or be a good listener when theyre having a problem   When you talk with them dont get super excited or start acting weird Just keep calm Theyre a normal person just like you Act natural and theyll find it much easier to interact with you   Greet them every now and then at first warmly then a bit more flirtatiously Say hi in the halls or talk to them a bit   Smile at your crush and make eye contact but dont be creepy about it For example if you do not know your crush very well get to know himher slowly Asking them for the time talking about a book they are reading etc If they are a friend start flirting slightly   When conversing with your crush make sure that you spend at least as much time listening as you do talking   Dont send them a bunch of notes or hang around after school and wait for them Dont get their phone number from other people or do any kind of stalking This will make them not want to talk with you or spend any time with you Think about how your actions will really look to them especially if they dont share your feelings   Dont get other people to ask them out for you dont be a jerk to the person that theyre dating and dont be dramatic about talking or not talking to them This will only stress you out and make other people including your crush not want to deal with you   If you want to go out with your crush just ask them out Cut out the worry from your life and get it over with At least youll know how they feel and you can move on Besides theyll appreciate your bravery in asking   If you do ask them out do it in private This will be less stressful for you and they wont feel pressured into giving you an answer they dont really mean They may not even have ever thought about you romantically even if they would like to date you in the end Give them the opportunity to decide   When you ask them out ask with a specific date in mind This will keep things from getting awkward Ask something like Would you like to go out to a movie with me this weekend or Do you want to come with me to the arcade on Friday   If they dont return your feelings dont feel like its the end of the world Although your crush might have seemed perfect or perfect for you keep in mind that there are plenty of people out there You want someone who returns your feelings  so if your crush doesnt then they just werent the right person for you You will find your special someone

You donât want to think of yourself as anybodyâs girlfriend until you know yourself better Otherwise you risk being defined as somebodyâs girlfriend instead of what makes you uniqueYou can learn about yourself by thinking about why you liked him in the first place Things you like about your crush can actually give you clues about who you are and want to becomeFor example you may feel that you like the guy because he sounds smart when he talks in class That tells you that you admire the quality of intelligence and you would probably like to be seen as smart yourself You may even realize that you donât know your crush as well as you thought you did   You wouldnât want a relationship with a guy who doesnât like you A good relationship is balancedAsk your parents what healthy relationships are like   Think about your talents and good qualities Get busy doing things you like to doGet involved with sports clubs and schoolHang out with friends or find an afterschool activity you enjoy Try reading some new books Remember how special and wonderful you are   You can develop better study skills to prepare for your future education if you donât date in middle school Being preoccupied with boys gets in the way of homeworkSome kids who date in middle school even end up dropping out of school You want to have an education so that youâll be able to get a good job and support yourself in the future Youâre also less likely to get depressed if you ditch the idea of dating in middle school Focus on making good friends instead of thinking about romantic relationshipsDating in middle school involves things like talking texting sitting around at a fast food place holding hands maybe a hug â youâre not missing out on anythingBut you could miss out on some great friends if youâre busy spending time with crushes in middle school Relationships with your friends and even your best friends can sufferGuys in middle school are immature For example they may be more interested in playing basketball after school than having a girlfriend If you wait until youâre older to start thinking about guys romantically you will probably have more freedom to date then anyways for instance with curfew time you can spend on the phone or internet places you can hang out etc
When you are first getting to know a girl it is important to avoid sharing too much about yourself too soon Sharing too much about yourself too soon can be overwhelming for a girl and also makes you seem less mysterious Keep some of the mystery alive by withholding certain details until you get to know each other betterFor example you should avoid discussing topics like your ex family conflicts or your personal finances Instead focus on questions that help you get to know her better Ask her about her likes and dislikes her friends and family her interests etc   Research has shown that prolonged eye contact can increase feelings of attraction between two peopleIf you are trying to win her over try looking into her eyes with a penetrating gaze Just keep in mind that she may break the gaze if she is not interested If she is interested she will most likely give you some encouraging looks and smiles even if she takes her eyes away from yours now and then   If a long gaze does not seem appropriate yet or you are just too nervous to hold a long gaze try giving her frequent quick glances Mirroring her body position can show a girl that you are interested and provide opportunities for her to do the same You might already be doing this without noticing it But if not make a conscious effort to start mirroring her body position For example if a girl is leaning in towards you with one arm on the table you can lean in with the opposite arm so that you look like a mirror image of her Smiling is an easy way to show a girl that you are interested in her and give her a chance to give you a smile in return Smiling may also make you seem more attractive to the girl which may work in your favor as wellTry to keep your smile as natural and relaxed as possible Donât force it or smile in a way that is unusual for you   As you flirt and do other things to impress a girl watch for signs that she is interested in you If she is smiling making eye contact and mirroring your body position then this might be a good sign Other positive signs include touching her hair adjusting her clothes raising and lowering her eyebrows or giving you a casual touch on the arm Sometimes two people are just not meant to be together If a girl does not show interest after you have done your best to get her attention move on She may never change her mind about you and if you keep chasing her you may miss your opportunity to meet someone else who really does like you

This could be a library a beach a park or a diner This will remove any extra pressure and nerves that she may have  Compliment her on something that has caught your eye and never let her know your intentions   Many of my friends who are jocks have tried this For instance a big win at a school competition might just be a good time to kiss your girlfriend with passion due to school spirit   This works best at the end of a fun date such as seeing a movie or going swimming You look her deep into her eyes hold both of her hands tell her that you are about to kiss her and just do it   Lets say that you and your girlfriend are studying together and all of a sudden it gets cold You move closer to her allow her to lean into you make sure that she enjoys you being in her personal space tilt her chin and give her a long kiss   In winter you could buy mistletoe and hang it on a tree branch You could then walk with your girlfriend tell her to look up whisper mistletoe and kiss then hug her Be creative   You cannot go throughout life being fearful of rejection Girls love confidence chivalry and good hygiene Be sure that the girl at least knows you well enough to determine that you arent only interested in making out Nice guys finish first and even if they dont they get let down easy   Make sure that your lips are okay and that your breath is fresh Dental hygiene is extremely important and dont let her see you chewing gum right before you make the big move Keep the kiss short but not too short Generally about 10 seconds is ideal

Before you begin writing a love letter you should spend some time brainstorming This means gathering your thoughts so you can better express yourself when writing the physical letter To start ask yourself some questions   Who are you writing the letter to Think about how you know this girl Is she someone you admire from school who youve never spoken to Is she a barista at a local coffee shop who you admire but are unsure how to approach What do you like about this person As you begin thinking about the letters recipient think about why youre infatuated with her What about her do you admire and why Go beyond mere physical beauty For example if youre writing about a barista you have a crush on you might admire her hairstyle and eyes However try to push beyond this What about her personality is intriguing to you Is she always particularly polite with customers Does she always smile at people even if they dont smile backCan you think of any specific incidents People are attracted to people who notice them If you can think of a specific moment when you realized you had feelings for this person that would be great to include in the letter Try to jog your memory and think of a specific moment when you began to develop romantic feelings It can be hard to write to someone you do not know Even if you admire this person very much you will not have as much information at your disposal as you would writing to someone you have an existing relationship with Therefore focus on the energy over the message Even if your feelings are vague the fact you wrote a letter at all speaks volumesWriting someone a love letter takes courage and commitment You have to sit down and physically write out your feelings Delivering the letter carries a risk of rejection especially if the recipient is very much a stranger to you Therefore the effort you took to write the letter in and of itself may be seen as impressive by the recipientRemember your intention if you feel nervous or frustrated when writing the letter You want to let this stranger know you admire her The energy behind that intention is more important than finding the perfect words and phrases Allow your intent to guide you as you begin to express your feelings If youre still struggling to think of ideas focus on the past present and future This can get your creative juices flowing When did you meet this person What is your relationship now What do you hope for in the future Some details may be inexact when writing a love letter to a stranger but you may find some inspiration considering these factors   When did you first notice this person Did she sit ahead of you in algebra class and you noticed the smell of her conditioner Did you order a latte from her when you were having a bad day and notice she drew a smiley face on the side of your cup While your meeting may have been brief and while she may not remember you might have noticed something you can include in your letterHow does this person affect you now While you may not have a relationship in the present you may still gain something valuable from daytoday interactions with this person For example maybe its nice to see her through the window as you pass by your local Starbucks Maybe its nice to overhear the music shes listening to before the bell rings for classFinally think of the future Where do you want to go from here Maybe you just wanted to express your feelings rather than bottling them up However maybe youre hoping you could meet this person and the two of you could get to know each other Think about what you want from this letter when considering the future When you feel ready to write the letter begin by stating your intent This can be brief as short as a single sentence However its an important sentence You want the recipient to know this is a letter expressing some deep feelings so shell pay attention to its content For example you could say something like We dont know each other but Im writing to tell you Ive admired you for quite some time We have an algebra class together in a lecture hall on campus and I think your taste in music is amazing
You have a crush which is normal and healthy and youâve decided you want to hide your feelings for now Understandable To hide your feelings you need to stay calm around your crush To beat your anxiety you first need to accept that being around them might make you nervousBeing nervous is a completely normal emotional reaction Donât fight or ignore the feelingYou donât need to feel angry at yourself or embarrassed about your nervousness Accepting it can help you control it  Being around your crush can be really nervewracking You might find yourself breathing very fast or holding your breath when theyâre around This is a normal reaction but it can make you feel even more anxious Keeping your breath slow and regular is an easy way to calm yourself down   Try a simple deep breathing exercise Inhale while counting to five then exhale while counting to fiveBreathe in slowly through your nose letting your stomach expand Then breathe out through your mouth while you contract your stomach muscles Maybe youâre shy or just not ready yet Maybe your crush already has a significant other Whatever that reason is donât allow it to affect you negatively Instead of worrying about things you canât control focus on things that make you happyWhenever your crush enters your thoughts try humming your favorite song or thinking back on a happy memory Call a friend or watch a funny video It doesnât matter what you choose to focus on as long as it brings you joy Some examples are your pet the scent of a flower the memory of your last birthday party and other happy memories   For instance you might think âHeâs much more popular than me He would never like me backâ Try to immediately counter this with something positive You could think âBut Iâm popular too I have lots of friends and other people have had crushes on meâ   Maybe youâre having thoughts like âI canât believe I have a crush on my best friendâs boyfriend Theyâre going to figure it out and Iâll lose both of themâ Change that to âOkay so I think heâs cute Big deal Iâm not the first girl in the world to have this feeling Crushes are normal and this will passâ Maybe youâre surprised by who you have a crush on Maybe you thought you liked guys but now you have a crush on a girl or vice versa This is not a bad thing You have no reason to feel shame or think about yourself negatively

Pointing out your distaste for your childâs date when they are around can be a recipe for disaster Whatâs more saying âI donât like himherâ in someoneâs face is just plain rude Your child is more likely to consider your point of view if you pull them aside and have the conversation in private Also be sure to do this early on and not spring this on your child at an awkward moment like right before they head out to prom   You might start by asking about the state of the relationship âSo you and David have been dating for a few weeks now How are things goingâ Getting a feel for your childâs opinion of the relationship can help you frame your discussion Plus depending on their response âUmm things arenât going so well I think weâll probably break things offâ you might no longer find a conversation necessary Another option is to ask what your teen finds appealing about their date This can help you to see their perspective and you may see positive qualities in the person that you did not notice before  Once you have gauged your childâs impression of their date gently share your concerns Offer clear examples as to what rubs you the wrong way about their date   Be thorough by providing details to support your apprehension You might say âI donât like the way he talks to you I heard him say the other day that you better not do this or that He comes off like you are a piece of property or someone who has to obey himâIf you are direct about your concerns then in the future your teen might start to notice them on their own   Its easy for parents to come off as living vicariously through their children or sheltering their children from situations they went through Your concern is with your teen and their date so try to maintain focus on the issue at hand rather than digressing into a lecture about your own teen romance drama   For example avoid saying something personal and judgmental like âIâve seen that type beforeâ Make the discussion about your child by saying things like You dont seem happy or Youve stopped hanging with your friends since you started dating them It can be harsh to hear that your parent doesnt like your significant other Teens often get totally wrapped up in their love lives Showing any sort of disapproval could start a war between the two of you   Take the time to remind your teen that you are doing this out of love for them Add in âI love you and I want the best for you I want you to be with someone who appreciates how amazing you areâ Once youâve said your piece sit back and listen Show that you are willing to hear your child out and get their take on the matter A give and take discussion is especially important with teens who often feel like their parents value their opinionsShow youâre engaged and listening by waiting until your child has finished talking before replying Nod shake your head or gesture to indicate that youâre paying attention If you donât understand paraphrase by saying something like âSo youâre saying the way he talks to you is just a form of affectionâ
Talk to each other Take it easy if your crush is shy Talk about each others interests favorite movies video games music etc  Once youve become friends start partnering up in science class trying to be on the same team in gym playing sports together at recess or just hanging out at the park to do some studying or skateboarding Its always important to do something your crush likes to do without making it seem like a date Do not try to give hugs or affectionately touch each other in any way You guys are just friends at this stage   Once you think your crush likes you start doing more activities together When going to a field trip go to interesting spots together When you think you want to be more than friends and you are ready try asking the other to go out Dont tell your friends what youre trying to do no matter how trustworthy they may be They will find a way to embarrass you in front of your crush Keep what you are doing together a secret its your personal business   You really need to let your special someone know that youre cool Dont be up in their face or act weird Theyll start to like you   Once you guys are real good friends go in for the big step Ask them out Make it simple Dont go all crazy with the drama and flowers and all that crap Just make it sound like your asking what the days home work was   Say something like Would you mind going ____________with me on Friday Or Do you want to go to __________ with me next weekend   Keep it really simple If you make it too sudden or harsh they may take it the wrong way   If they say yes good for you you have a date If they say no dont go all big with the cold shoulder and drama Maybe your crush just wanted to be friends Treat that as a complimentââyou dont know the future so stay good friends instead   They will get the wrong message Keep your secret a secret until you know both of you want the whole school knowing Once you tell one person it just zooms like lightning everywhere
When you flirt watch them and see if they smile look pleased andor flirt back This can help you tell whether they are interested in you too If they are uncomfortable tone it down or stop You may naturally have an idea of what to do and here are some options   Look at them from across the room and smile Find ways to touch them like fixing their hair picking lint off their shirt or touching their arm Dont trap them though some people dont like touching  Smile Play with your hair Face your crush and use open body language Compliment them once or twice Keep it light Avoid smothering your crush with compliments or touching them too much This can make them uncomfortable   This will help you analyze if they are responding positively to flirting and if they like you back Someone who is interested in you might flirt back seek you out to talk more and show signs of embarrassment such as blushing or looking away while smiling   A disinterested person might use closedoff body language avoid your touch show signs of embarrassment while not smiling and look away as if planning an escape Either you are coming off too strong and need to tone it down or they are not interested and you should stop   Sometimes a person on the outside can be a more objective judge of what exactly is going on here They can usually offer good advice about whether the other person likes you back and what to do next   While confessing to your crush how you feel about them may not be the best idea depending on the circumstances if you feel like its a good idea then go for it If you want the best chances of getting into a relationship however look at their signals and analyze them closely before telling them how you feel
Dont waste time beating around the bush Just tell him that you know he likes you and that youre just not interested in him in that way Tell him you wish it was different and know that it puts you in an uncomfortable place but that you just dont see him as more than a friend   Tell him that it wasnt easy for you to open up about this but that it was necessary Hell appreciate that you valued him enough to tell him the truth Just because youre being honest doesnt mean that you should get into the top five reasons why you would never date him If youre not feeling it thats okay  but you dont have to make him feel flawed or not good enough for you   Dont be wishywashy about it If you dont like him you dont like him Dont say that youre not at the right place in your life to like him right now or that youll think about it in a year once youre done with school This will only make you look like a flake The more firm and clear you are the more hell get the message and will leave you alone on the romantic front   Though it sounds harsh the most important thing is to not give him hope If he thinks theres even a chance that youll like him later hell keep waiting for it to happen Remember that being firm doesnt mean that you have to be cruel You dont have to say that theres a 0 chance that youll ever get together or that theres no way youd ever go out with him You will essentially be saying this  but in a nice way Dont apologize Though the situation is uncomfortable and you feel bad for him you cant help how you feel   The worst thing you can do is lie about why you wont go out with him instead of being honest and just saying youre not feeling it Though you may think that a lie or an excuse will make him feel less rejected the opposite is actually true Hell be able to tell if youre bluffing from a mile away and that will only make him feel worse If hes really your friend then you should respect him enough to tell him the truth Here are some excuses you want to avoid   Dont say My life is just so crazy busy right now No matter how busy you are youd be able to make time for someone special This will only make him feel unimportant and even more hurt if he sees you with someone else a few weeks later Dont say Its not you its me Dont make up excuses about how you need to work on yourself before being in a relationship or that you dont know how to commit or that you have low selfesteem If you really wanted to be with him you would be Dont say You can do so much better than me Dont put yourself down as a way to make him feel better He wont Dont say I like you but I dont want to ruin our friendship Unless hes your best friend in the world how many times is that one true   This should be absolutely true Let him know that he really is an important friend to you and that youre so lucky to have him Though you shouldnt say you dont want to date him because hes such a good friend do say that you hope this doesnt get in between your friendship and tell him that hes been such an amazing friend to you   Be sincere Make eye contact and speak slowly to let him know how much he really means to you You dont have to go overboard Dont spend twenty minutes extolling his greatest features Hell begin to think If Im so great then why wont she date me   Once youve said your piece its likely that hell have something to say back to you Maybe hell ask some questions ask what he could have done differently or just tell you hes hurt Or hell even show that hes a bit mad and youll see that his pride is wounded   Whatever his reaction take the time to let him talk to you while you nod listen and ask questions at the right time Dont let it feel like a oneway exchange Dont interrupt him If he talks youll have a better sense of how deep his feelings are and it can help you see where the friendship stands You may find out if he has a harmless crush or has been in love with you for years
Fasten it around the horses neck if you prefer or loop the bridle reins around the neck to keep them off the ground  The throatlatch noseband and flash should be unfastened with the straps hanging neatly to the outside of the cheekpieces and bit   Before you start fastening the buckles view the horse from the front and make sure the bridle pieces and bit lay straight and even on both sides of the face   The browband should be between the base of the horses ears and the top of the horns the bony protrusion above each eye It should be level and large enough not to pull the cheekpieces too close to the eye The buckles of the cheekpiece and strap to the noseband should be very close to each other for a good fit and neat look The throatlatch should fit basically like a necklace four fingers width The cavesson noseband should fit like a bracelet two fingers width The flash should fit like more like ring and needs to be BELOW the bit This way the flash wont interfere with the bits movement or pinch the corners of the mouth when you pick up on the reins   You should be able to fit four fingers under it it should fit like a necklace with ample room for your horse to breathe when the neck is flexed   This should fit like a bracelet you should be able to fit two fingers under it but can be adjusted to your horses preference Make sure the cheekpiece that attaches to the bit moves freely and that the noseband is under it   The buckle should lay on a fleshy nonbony area of the horses nose It should be somewhat between the bridge of the nose and the line of the lips Adjust the tightness of the flash to your horses comfort level start loose at first and tighten only enough to prevent gaping of the mouth but not so much that your horse feels trapped the jaws must move to maintain softness and relaxation while maintaining connection through the reins to the riders handssee image   Everything should be symmetrical and fitted   Hang the crown and the loop of the reins together on a hook The reins should hang with the right side of the leather facing up Now circle each strap cavesson throatlatch flash around the bridle and secure Do not buckle the straps â just push the straps end through the leather keepers This will help the bridle keep the correct shape and also ensure that you dont lose any straps off the headstall
It can be any color and any type as long as it could not potentially harm your guinea pig Set it in the area you will be training in   Be sure to turn it upsidedown so that your guinea pig will not knock it over as you begin to teach the trick A garbage can that may have contained anything that could be harmful should not be used   Gently lift them out of their cage and set them down near the garbage canother object Allow the guinea pig to sniff around if they feel the need Some may ignore it but this does not mean that they wont do the trickhave patience   Hold out one of the treats and lure your guinea pig towards the garbage can Move it slightly further away and around it until your guinea pig has completed a quarter of the circle Click and treat   Do this three or four times until your guinea pig becomes comfortable with moving around it a bit   Every time the guinea pig moves forward a few steps reward them with a clickor verbal marker and a treat Gradually increase the amount of steps they take before receiving the treat   Hopefully your guinea pig will soon discover that moving around the garbage can does not go without rewards Many will figure this out within a few minutes of doing that same thing but if they dont go back to luring and go on from there as many times as your guinea pig needs it   Some guinea pigs will pick this up faster than others and thats okay No piggy is perfect no matter how intelligent they may be   The hand motion can be whatever you see fit but I have found that holding a finger above the object where the guinea pig can clearly see it and moving it around in a circular motion Saying the command Around or Spin may help as well but verbal commands are more for the trainer than for the animal themselves   From this point on only treat your guinea pig when they walk around after your hand motion If they do it without your motion just sit patiently until they are done and ask them to do it afterwards If they do it treat and praise them immensely It takes many guinea pigs a long time to understand this but if the trainer is persistent it will be very rewarding in the end   Once the guinea pig is very good at walking around the garbage can on your hand motion put the can up somewhere and do the motion This can be very easy or very hard depending on the piggy
The important thing is to show the person you are crushing on that you are not ready to give into them right away Have a few supplies with you to occupy yourself for when you see your crush like   A book or a magazine A pen and a sketchbook A cell phone  A large part of having a crush involves some degree of ignoring someone Dont go out of your way If you appear to be unaffected by this persons presence youll appear to look normal This can be a difficult step if youre head over heels   Do not make it too apparent that you are trying to ignore them It could be obvious if youre trying too hard Stay calm and collected   When you see them do not gaze at them too directly Play with the circumstance by giving them sly looks and then appear distracted by looking around the room Try to give off a slight smile on your face and in your eyes if they catch your eye contact This is a great calming method that hits at the core of why you dont feel normal The worst possible outcome from appearing awkward and nervous around your crush is not life threatening By accepting the larger picture of the world you may be able to relax about your feelings towards your crushA lot of people feel like the social microscope is fixed on them but the reality is that most people are concerned about themselves People are not watching you and looking for an opportunity to scrutinize you You dont want to ask your crush if they want to hang out If theyre nearby talk with youre friends about your plans for the weekend If youre in a situation where youre talking to them about your plans dont ask them to join you Theyll seek it out if theyre interestedYou could even talk about how you and your friends are trying to get a big group together for yada yada Then make it obvious that they could come if they ask   It is normal to acknowledge people Nothing detrimental will happen if you give them a casual hello or even just a wave or smile Saying hi or hey with a smile can potentially stir their world It is the most casual thing you can do if you meet eye contact Youll seem collected and the pressure is now in their court   Making friends with your crushs friends might alleviate your nervous feelings by closing the distance between you and them Talk to your crushs friends like a buddy Theyll remember you as being cool and might speak highly of you to your crush   Dont flirt with any of them You dont want them to think youre interested or they might develop a crush on you   Dont be afraid to call a little attention to yourself This can improve your confidence level if you choose to wear something that makes you feel good and attractive This is one way that might spark their attention   If you go over the top they could become intimidated but if this is the case then rethink this crush Dont be afraid to be yourself Honesty is the best policy   It is common to project what you want to see in your crush as opposed to who they really are Nobodys perfect but it could help you get a better grip of yourself by knowing some of their flaws   Dont get too nosy or they could find out and become alarmed
The bridle should be draped over your nondominant arm ready to be put on the horseThe bridle holds the bit in place The bridle includes the reins which is what you use to guide the horse by pulling on them to move the bit   Depending on the type of bridle you have you may need to unbuckle the nose strap to make it easier Youll need to unbuckle English bridles for instance  The first part of a bridling a horse is taking its halter off The halter is what fits over the horses face so you can lead it around when you are not riding it You usually take it off to ride though some people do apply a bit and bridle over the halterUnbuckle the strap and pull the halter down off the horses face If your horse is accustomed to being bridled you can take the halter completely off If its not you should buckle just the strap around the horses neck That way you can hold on to the horse if it tries to move away   To put the bridle on youll need to bring the horses head down To bring its head down use your hand between its ears to guide its head lower You also want to move its head towards you if possibleSometimes the horse will need some convincing or will seem nervous Dont try to shove its head down Rather keep gentle pressure on its head until it relaxes its head and moves it down Make sure the bridle is going the right direction facing outward When its facing the correct way put the reins over the horse to get them out of the way Draping them is easier than having them drag on the ground Now put the bridle in your dominant hand Your dominant arm should be next to the horse and you should be facing the same direction the horse is except maybe turned slightly towards the horse The top piece crown should be in your dominant hand so you can pull it over the horses head As you pull the crown up the horses head make sure the curb chain or strap is separate from the bit Only certain types of bridles have curb chains so yours may not have one The curb chain goes under the horses chin which is why you need to separate it from the bit Dont bang the horses teeth with the curb strap No you dont ask the horse with words You tell the horse you want it to open its mouth by inserting your thumb into its mouth behind the teethThe teeth sit to the front of the horses mouth leaving a space behind them for the bit Basically you want to aim for the back edge of the mouth along the side of the horses headUse your nondominant hand to stick a thumb in the horses mouth as youre holding the crown with your dominant hand If the horse seems reluctant try moving your thumb around Lightly touch the horses gums Doing so will tell the horse it needs to open its mouth   Once the horses mouth is open slide the bit in As you do make sure you guide the bit between the horses teeth Be careful of the horses teeth Try not to touch them at all with the bit Keep moving it gently back until the bit is in the back of the horses mouth At the same time pull the crown of the bridle up over the horses head sliding the bit into placeThe pressure should come from the crown moving up not you pushing the bit with your left handIf the bridle has a curb strap be sure to guide that with your left hand too The bit goes over the horses tongue not under it Make sure to move the ears forward first Dont smash them down just use your hand to move them one at a time As you do pull the crown over each side until the bridle is in place to complete putting the bridle onSome bridles have a brow band that stays across the forehead Others have loops that go over the horses ears Fasten the buckle around the neck called the throatlatch Make sure you can put about four fingers underneath it After that buckle the chin strap leaving two fingers worth of space underneath it In addition you may need to buckle the curb strapIf you have an English bridle youll need to buckle the nose piece into place   Once again youll use the halter to keep hold of the horse by strapping the halter around its neck Right now its not completely on Youre just using it as a way to steady the horse as you take the bridle off Now do all the straps in reverse Unbuckle the chin strap and the curb strap if the bridle has one Unbuckle the nose piece if the bridle has one Also undo the throatlatch In other words make sure all the buckles are undone in anticipation of pulling the bridle off Using your dominant hand take hold of the crown and pull it over the horses ears Try not to smash the horses ears as you pull it off The horse should naturally release the bit but as you pull the bridle off use your nondominant hand to guide the bit through the horses teeth Once youve pulled the bridle off and away unbuckle the halter from the neck The halter goes on much like the bridle except without the bit Instead you just have the headstall instead of the crown and a nose band instead of a bit Slide the headstall over the horses head as you pull the nose band over the horses nose making sure you dont smash the horses ears or poke the horse in the eye Buckle or clip the throatlatch into place around the horses headThe lead line should be attached to the halter so you can lead the horse back to the stall or wherever you want it to go   If the horse doesnt want to take the bit or it seems uncomfortable with the bit you should have the horse checked by a vet Problems with the mouth tongue or teeth including ulcers can lead to problems with the bit because they will make the bit uncomfortable for the horse If the vet doesnt find anything try a horse dentist instead If your horse is always chewing on the bit it can cause problems with the bridle set up stretching out the leather among other issues One way you can help your horse is to slowly train it to become used to the bit without chewing by letting the horse wear it for a certain period each dayStart by putting the bit and bridle on the horse while its in its stall making sure you dont use one that can catch on things in the stall Also take off the reins and nose band before putting it on Stay with the horse will it has the bridle on Leave it on for about an hour Keep doing this training everyday until the horse seems comfortable and doesnt chew anymore Next try it on the longe line with a halter over the bridle Work with the horse a little everyday until it seems comfortable without chewing the bit After that you can try riding the horse   Some horses dont like certain bits and they wont respond how youd like to your rein movement Bits put pressure on the tongue so sometimes a bit that doesnt put as much pressure on the tongue can be helpful if your horse is sensitive For instance some curve across the tongue instead of going straight acrossSee if anyone you know has bits you can borrow to try on your horse That way you can see which one works the best A different bit can also help retrain your horse not to put its tongue over the bit if it has picked up that habit   If your horse keeps putting its tongue over the bit and youve tried other options you can add a tongue port It fits over the bit and a rubber part hangs down The rubber bit makes it harder for your horse to move its tongue over the bit
Consider why she is asking If you have an idea about how she feels it will help you have a more productive conversation with her We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language so try to understand what is going on using these signalsIf she is raising her eyebrows she might be uncomfortable This might mean that she does not want you to like her If she is mirroring your body language then you are probably connecting Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesnât want the same thing If she is making lots of eye contact this shows interest But it could go both ways she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesnât want to hurt you or because she likes you A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you For example if she is smiling she has her head titled to the side and she is holding or touching her face at the same time this could mean that she does like you However always believe what she says over any of the signals you get Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings   Once you have considered how she feels and evaluated her body language you do not have to over think her feelings for you The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels And believe what she says over the other signals you feel like you may be getting   Do not feel bad about what you think she feels or thinks This is not going to help you stay confident and it is also probably not accurate   This will help you to know how to talk to her If she has a crush on someone else or is with someone else you will want to approach this conversation differently You would know because you may have heard other people talk about it or she may talk about it herself   If you do know she is with someone else acknowledge it at the start of the conversation You will need to say that you do not want to step on her relationship Stay a little more reserved or distant in your conversation while still remaining honest You can ask her do you want me to tell you about my feelings Sometimes when a person asks a question they are not interested in hearing a sincere answer For example in this instance she may be trying to point out that you are acting like you like her Being honest and straightforward in your question âdo you want me to be honestâ will be the best way to deal with this possibility Stay further away from her physically and emotionally if she is with someone Getting close to her or being very open and honest might make her feel uncomfortable You will want to keep your distance   Do you know whether she is allowed to date Some people may be interested in dating but have parents who are strict about dating rules If you know that she isnât allowed to date you may want to acknowledge this fact in the conversation Try to make her feel comfortable if she seems worried about her parents Tell her that you do not want to step on her relationship with her parents   In this case you may not need to tell her that you have a crush on her You can simply acknowledge that she is not allowed to date Keep your distance physically to help her feel comfortable

biologically programmed to fall in love  Getting over a relationship is hard even if that relationship never fully materialized Give yourself some time to mope around and feel badly then pick yourself up and move forward Make sure youre not upset for too long   While feeling sad also take steps to comfort yourself Try taking a hot shower listening to one of your favorite playlists and speaking nicely to yourself Knowing that this relationship will never progress is an important step in moving past it Remind yourself again and again that what youâre doing is necessary for your own personal happiness and growth   Remember that you will have other crushes In many peoples minds having a crush on your teacher veers towards the inappropriate sector no matter how you feel There will be others who you will prefer in the future and others who you have a real chance with Focus ahead without dwelling too much on this dynamic with your teacher   The reason you are in school is to learn and get a proper education so take the energy you would normally spend thinking about your teacher and refocus on it and also on your work Youâll see improvements in your academic performance and it will take your mind off your teacher   Thoughts frequently lead to action and visualizing something makes it more likely to occur and people will see youThinking about your teacher increases your chances of doing something you might later regret   Try focusing on things about your teacher that you dont like The idea here is not to dwell on the negatives but to remind yourself that the relationship was not as perfect as you remember it being eg Age difference appearances  Interact with your teacher in class but do not seek them out or try to spend time with them outside of your designated class time It just isnt right for you especially as they will probably quite a bit older than you It is generally ok to date a person older than you in later life but a young person dating an older teacher is often considered inappropriate Making decisions in advance about how you will handle your impulses can help you to be more successful in conquering themThink about how youâd like to act when talking to your teacher and then follow through on your plan   If you are concerned that your crush on your teacher is impacting your daytoday life and also preventing you from concentrating on your studies talk to a therapist or school guidance counselor   If you are concerned about privacy talk to a therapist rather than a guidance counselor Your therapist is required by a code of ethics to keep what you say confidential Guidance counselors are not bound by the same code and can easily report information thats revealed to them Your friends may have similar experiences coping with crushes and might be able to offer some interesting advice or perspective If nothing else talking about your feelings might make you feel less alone   If you find yourself unable to stop thinking about or interacting inappropriately with your teacher it might be time to make a more drastic change Talk to your guidance counselor or academic advisor about transferring out of the class   Be honest with your counselor about the feelings youre having for your teacher If they dont fully understand how much these feelings are distracting you from your schoolwork they might not be willing to let you change classes Trust that they are professionals who are trained to deal with situations like this   Pursue new hobbies and renew old passions Join new clubs and sports or recommit to old ones Take the time and energy you previously spent lusting after your teacher and put it towards something productive Also try to get out and find some new people to spend time with to get your mind off them   Develop relationships with other people especially people your own age Work on strengthening current friendships and cultivating new ones Open your mind to meeting and spending time with new people and you may find yourself falling out of love faster than you think   Taking a trip or changing up your surroundings is incredibly healthy Traveling can help you expand your mind and see the world in an entirely new light Traveling also teaches patience flexibility and perspective which are all important qualities that will help you get over your teacher   The best way to get over an old relationship is to get involved in a new one Dont rush into anything youre not comfortable with but allow yourself to be open to the idea of dating and pursuing relationships with new people because you have to move on   Theres no agreed upon length of time to wait after suffering a broken heart But it is important to take some time to yourself after a breakup to rediscover who you are what you like and what you value in yourself and in a future partner
Some guys bond with people by doing things instead of through talking He might feel closer to you if you do side by side activities together Examples of side by side activities would be playing sports playing a game or working on a project together Pay attention to the kinds of activities that he likes to do and do those activities with him For example if he likes to do outdoors activities like shooting have him teach you how to shoot a gun Or if there is a game that he likes to play learn how to play too   Even if you donât know how to do the activities that he likes to do it can mean a lot to him if you try to learn Enjoy yourself while you are out with him Laugh aloud at your mistakes ask lots of questions and talk to the other people who are doing the activity too Even if he is a guy who enjoys talking it might build your relationship in a new way if you do side by side activities together   Some guys do feel connected with girls based on their feelings and talking and even guys who may not be always excited to talk about their feelings may want to talk to you about the things they care about once they are really comfortable with you After you have spent quality time getting to know him you should move on to getting to know him on a deeper level He will feel closer to you and rely on you more if you know more about what he cares about and the history of his life   These kinds of conversations are great to have at night You should ask him questions about important times in his past the important relationships in his life and the things he cares about For example you can ask him âWhich of your interests means the most to who you are and why do you care so much about itâ Or ask him âWho in your family do you think you are the closest with and whyâ These questions can be really simple but listening well will help you have a really meaningful conversation with him   For your conversation sit across from him or in a position where you can see his face and hear him well Ask him questions about him and use the following listening skills to have a great conversation with himShow him in your body posture that you are listening Make eye contact nod your head and react to him with small noises or gestures while he is speaking Give him the right amount of distance If you stand too close you may come off as overly interested and stifling while standing too far away will make you seem distant Give him space to talk but position yourself so that you can hear and see him well Restate the main idea of what he is saying This will let him know that you really understand the point what he is saying If he is talking about his frustrating day for example you can summarize the most important parts of what he has said so far For example you could say âSo you are saying that you didnât understand why your brother was acting up until you saw what was going on with him at schoolâ Be empathetic to his feelings Empathy means you can understand the feeling that he experienced even if you do not share a common feeling For example you can combine restating his main idea and being empathetic by saying something like âYou must have felt so frustrated to have to retake that test after you studied so hard the first timeâ It is important to tell him that you understand the feelings he has and the reasons why he feels the way he does   Donât forget to put yourself out there too If you really like him you could feel shy talking about yourself but he will build a better connection with you if you can talk to him about the things that you care about too Tell him about the important relationships in your life the big experiences that you are going through and the good things that you love in your life As before make eye contact with him when you talk use your gestures to express your feelings and let your tone of voice express what you mean He will be better able to connect and care for you when he is able to understand what important stuff that is going on with you   Everyone needs someone to lean on during hard times If you can be that person for him you will build a really strong bond that will make him feel close to you There are lots of things you can do to be there for him in hard times For example if you know he has been struggling with his grades and is going to have a difficult conversation with his teacher send him a text encouraging him before he goes into talk You can say something like âGood luck I know youâll be able work it out because you always doâ Then after his talk with his teacher ask him how it went and let him know you are there if he wants to talk   Sometimes people would rather be distracted when they are going through something hard In that case send him funny texts that make him laugh If he tells you that he is having a hard time with something ask him if he wants to get together and talk about it Or you can let him know that you are there for him if he just wants to hang out and chill If you can be there for him during hard times this will make your connection deeper and make him more likely to go to you the next time something good or bad happens with him   Guys like it when they feel needed If something is going on with you that you need help with let him know and ask for his help in advance For example if you need help painting posters after school for a club ask him if there is a day he is available to help you When he gets there make sure that you have something for him to do Accomplishing tasks together is a great way to bond people together in new ways
Just as youre going through changes as a teenager boys in your grade are also experiencing changes Try to familiarize yourself with changes boys undergo You can ask your health teacher where to find reading information or ask your parents If you have a slightly older male relative you trust such as a male cousin who is in college they may be willing to talk to you about changes boys undergo during pubertyYou may notice some physical changes in the boys in your class Their voices may get deeper and they may begin to grow hair on their faces and underarms Like you boys will also undergo sexual changes They will start to release testosterone and begin to experience erections Be understanding that boys may be embarrassed of sexual changes just like you may be initially embarrassed of your period  While puberty is a normal part of growing up it is normal to have some insecurity about puberty Teenage boys in your grade may be embarrassed by physical and other changes theyre undergoing so be understanding of thisBoys often undergo changes in puberty that can be awkward or embarrassing Teenage boys may experience erections without cause for example and their voices may squeak when they talk While it can be tempting to tease boys in your grade about puberty be understanding You are also undergoing changes and would not want to be teased Refrain from teasing the boys in your grade about common issues associated with puberty   While you may feel your experiences couldnt be more different than the experiences of teenage boys there is actually a lot of common ground You can better understand teenage boys if you identify areas where youre going through similar changesLike you boys are beginning to grow hair on the underarms and pubic region Boys also experience mood swings and feelings of anger and frustration due to changing hormones Hormones can also cause quick changes in energy levels You may notice people respond to you differently as you grow People see you more as an adult and may treat you differently This happens to boys during puberty as well   Boys sometimes treat you differently around their friends Teenage boys are often embarrassed to be interested in girls for the first time He may act standoffish towards you because he feels insecure He may also want to make it clear to his friends they are his priority Try to be understanding of this If you are dating a teenage boy allow him to have some friend timeHowever you should not put up with disrespect If a teenage boy is downright mean to you in front of his friends you should tell him you will not accept that kind of treatment Say something like I understand you want to act cool around your friends but it isnt okay for you to make fun of me   Often the best way to understand someone is simply to talk to them While talking to boys can be scary it is often helpful to understanding them better Learn to be brave and engage teenage boys in conversationAsk specific questions Ask about things like hobbies family and his favorite subjects in school For example Are you close to your siblings If youre unsure how to strike up a conversation make an observation based on something around you or something thats recently happened For example What did you think of yesterdays assembly   It can be easy to become frustrated with your teenager especially if they are acting out or otherwise rebelling Remember teens are very insecure and self conscious They are also striving to carve out an identity which may explain bouts of rebellion or occasionally being difficult On top of all that your teens brain is still developing and he doesnt yet have an adultsized capacity for things like impulse control and decisionmaking If youre having trouble understanding your teen boy pause and put yourself in his shoes Try to remember your own teenage yearsFor example if your teenager suddenly wants to stop an activity he once enjoyed put yourself in his shoes Maybe your teen was forced to play hockey during middle school He may want to feel like more of an individual now that hes getting older and try something different Think about times when you tried to explore or define your identity as a teen   Its important to understand the changes your teen is going through as a parent One of the best things you can do to understand teenage boys is to educate yourself about your teenRead about teenagers You can find reading online detailing the hormonal and mood changes teenagers undergo This will refresh you on the changes people undergo during their teenage years In addition to reading books about the physical changes your teen will undergo read young adult books targeted at teenage boys Fiction books can help you remember the emotions teenagers undergo Keep in mind that this research may not describe your teen exactly Its important to get to know your teenage boy not just the boys described in literature Take an interest in the things your teen is passionate about to connect and get to know him better   While its important to know what your teen is doing and who he is with remember teenage years are part of the transition into adulthood Its important your teen feels he has some privacy in your home so be respectful of his need for space and occasional alone timeThere are some things you should know about your teen Its reasonable to want to know where hes going and who hes with at all times However you should grant him some forms of privacy Understand teenage years are about identity Your teen may feel he needs a certain amount of privacy to establish his identity Things like text messages and phone calls should be private You should also understand you will probably not know every detail of your teens social life It may be a good idea to change some rules as your teenager ages You can lessen up restrictions on things like time spent on the phone and computer as these technologies are often how teens socialize and form an identity Keep an open dialogue going about rules and expectations and allow your teen some say in his life If your teen continually demonstrates he is unreliable however you may need to keep stricter rules in place for longer However if your teenager violates your trust or demonstrates serious irresponsibility you may need to take away their phone or remove other privileges Your teen should understand that trust is earned and that with your trust comes more privacy   The teenage brain is not fully developed As a parent its vital you understand teenage boys often have a limited understanding of consequences This can result in engaging in risky behavior so be sure to be vigilant You should make sure your teen is not taking major risks such as using drugs or alcoholThe teenagers developing brain does not give them a free pass for reckless behavior While it is important to keep this fact in mind do not give him a pass on misbehaving because he doesnt know any better Consequences are how he learns to make good choices You are still the parent so you should still have expectations and boundaries Things like bed times and curfews should still be enforced during your sons teenage years and you should also know where he is at all times Teenagers undergo a lot of hormonal changes This can lead to things like mood swings Try to be patient if your teen seems aggravated or is easily angered You should make sure your teen faces consequences for inappropriate or rude behavior but try to be understanding It will take a few years for your teen to adjust to hormonal changesHave patience Many parents feel the teenage years will never end but your son should eventually grow out of mood swings and anger problems caused by puberty Once your teen has calmed down you can have a discussion about his behavior Try not to lecture â instead focus on what he can do differently in the future For instance if he screamed something rude at you in a moment of anger discuss how next time he can stop and take a couple of deep breaths before responding   Odds are your son will start thinking about sex during his teenage years and may even explore pornography Recent research says the majority of adolescent males explore pornography websitesWhile this is a normal part of growing up its important you talk to your son about sex and porn   Talk to your son frequently about sex and sexuality and allow him to come to you with questions Its important you present the facts For example it may be a good idea to explain to your son the differences between sex in pornography and sex in real lifeIf he is extremely uncomfortable discussing the subject with you try to find a trusted third party like an uncle to help Do not panic if your teen asks about sex Asking about sex does not necessarily indicate your teenager is having sex or even considering doing so They may be curious which is normal Provide information about safe sex such as condoms STDs and birth control You can find ageappropriate reading material at a local library for your teen to browse Remember that educating your child about safe sex does not make it more likely they will become sexually activeLeave any conversation you have about sex open ended Say something to your teen like If you have any questions its always okay to come to me with them   If you need to communicate with your teenager look for the right time Pay attention to when your teen seems relaxed and receptive Make a habit of talking regularly during those times to keep communication in your home openIt may take some trial and error to figure out when your teen is most talkative Your teen may be more quiet when you pick him up from soccer practice but get chattier after dinner You could try engaging him in conversation then   Whether youre a parent or a teen yourself remember teenage boys may be private about certain things They may also be sensitive about some topics Instead of asking questions directly learn to ask openended questions This will allow a teenage boy to share information at his own discretionFor example do not ask Are you excited about the school dance Instead ask something like How are you feeling about the dance Do you think you feel comfortable going If your questions are met with short responses then this may not be a subject your teenager wishes to discuss Try to determine what your teenager does enjoy talking about Try talking about his hobbies and interests   If you are a teenage girl its important you stand up for yourself when necessary If a teenage boy is frequently teasing you to the point you feel uncomfortable it is within your right to let him know his behavior is not acceptableIt is okay to express your emotions to boys If a boy is making you feel uncomfortable say so clearly You may worry about a boy liking you but you should not strive to be liked at the expense of your feelings Say something if a boy is bothering you such as I dont like it when you comment on my body It makes me feel uncomfortable If teasing does not stop you can ask an adult such as a teacher for help   Teenagers may suffer from things like depression anxiety and other emotional issues While a certain amount of mood swings are normal if a teenager seems very unhappy or angry you should seek the help of a therapistWarning signs of a mental health issue includeDifficulty concentrating A sudden drop in grades Weight loss or gain Lack of motivation Difficulty sleeping Fatigue

of your personality and life       Let him do most of the talking unless if he seems uncomfortable with it If your crush is the shy type you may have to do most of the steering in the conversation and try not to intimidate him Be gentle and talk softly enough so that he is comfortable with the volume of your voice       Dont wait for your crush to start the conversation At this point you may have to start most of the conversations till you become a part of his daily life and hell begin to start the conversations when he recognizes you as that       If you keep silent and wait for your crush to come up to you and start the conversation the chances of that happening is extremely low unless if he is very interested in you and possibly curious enough to try to find out about you Its okay to be shy but there is a limit to how shy you can get Break out of your shell or youll never be able to make any progress in your relationship with your crush Build your confidence and tell yourself you can do it If he is the right guy for you youll win him over If he isnt dont let him get to you and simply move on with life     Make random appearances here and there If your crush or your crushs friends question you be ready with plausible excuses such as The other tables were full or My friend was sitting here so I came to sit here too Bring a trustworthy friend along to sit with you so that it doesnt seem awkward   If your crush sits at an allguys table its probably best to keep to your own tables Sit near enough so that he notices you but not in your crushs table if this happens to be the case       Dont sit alone or hell think youre a loner and not be interested   Keep in mind that once you become good enough friends with your crush your friendship with him can be the key to unlock the borders blocking you from his allguys table Just make sure to bring a friend along if youre uncomfortable about sitting with allguys Plus it could look suspicious to the students if youre the only girl at your crushs table       Your crush may unexpectedly walk up to you and invite you to sit with his table even if you two arent close enough friends yet Although this may be unlikely it could happen but dont wait for it to happen Make it happen
Your first resource should be your own buddies Ask your friends if theyve seen you and the girl together and ask their honest opinion about whether or not the girl has a crush on you Your friends may have more perspective on whether the girl actually likes you or if shes just playful and flirtatious with everyone Ask them to be honest  if they dont think she likes you they should let you know   Your guy friends may also know if the girl likes someone else instead of you This could be helpful information before you try talking to the girl yourself Just try not to ask anyone too chatty or a guy who is very friendly with the girl If you do the guy may tell her that you asked and hell blow your cover   Asking the girls friends if she likes you is basically as good as asking her yourself But if you really trust one of her friends and dont think shell report back to her friend then go ahead and ask if the girl has a crush on you Her friend will mostly likely know whether or not she likes you  itll just be a matter of whether or not shell tell you   Dont make a big deal about it Dont reveal your feelings about the girl   If you like the girl too and want to know her true feelings dont be afraid to ask Just find a time when youre both relatively alone and in a quiet place and ask her if she has a crush on you If you like her you can even tell her first that you have a crush on her and want to know if she likes you too Just speak calmly make eye contact and give her all of your attention to let her know shes important But dont make it seem like too much of a big deal or you may scare her away   If she does admit she has a crush on you and you like her then ask her out on a date and see where it takes you If she says she doesnt have a crush on you react the right way Dont get all upset or offended  just play it cool and show her what a great guy you are
Often we are afraid to talk to someone new or someone we like out of fear of being of looking bad or saying the wrong thing Your nerves may get the best of you and you may end up with your heart pounding in your chest as you try to talk to the guy Your nerves always make it more difficult for you to stay calm and focus on generating good conversation with him You can try to adjust this by focusing on keeping your breathing steady and relaxed even if you are nervousYou may take a few deep breaths before you approach the guy Do this by inhaling deeply filling your stomach with air Let your stomach puff out as you inhale expanding with air Try to inhale for a count of three Then exhale slowly for a count of three letting the air release from your stomach Your stomach should contract and pull in towards your spine You can also close your eyes and repeat a mantra as you do deep breathing You may repeat silently to yourself âI am calmâ or âI can do thisâ Repeating a mantra can help you stay focused and motivated to talk to the guy  You may also stay calm by taking time with your appearance so you appear calm once you are standing in front of him You may choose an outfit that makes you feel confident and poised such as your favorite shirt and jeans or your favorite piece of jewelleryYou may also decide to do your hair that day or put on some makeup so you can appear confident as you speak to him Keep in mind the best form of confidence often comes from within so you should not stress too much about getting your appearance just right Instead use your appearance as a way to project confidence and a healthy sense of self   Another way you can present yourself with confidence is to have open positive body language when you are talking with the guy Positive body language can show him that you are interested and engaged in the conversation It can also encourage him to keep talking to you and connectKeep your arms relaxed and at your sides with your body positioned towards him Maintain eye contact as you speak to him and nod when he speaks to show you are engaged in what he is saying You should also smile and laugh when appropriate to communicate positivity and engagement You may also lean slightly towards him when he speaks Note if he is responding to your positive body language with his own positive body language If he is mirroring your body language and displaying engagement with you as you speak this could be a good sign
Dont bottle up your emotions Trying to repress feelings often leads to more pain Rather than ignoring the pain open yourself up to the full spectrum of emotions Grieve for what could have been Express gratitude that this friend has been in your life Think of the good and bad times Whatever emotions come accept themIf the emotions are too overwhelming take a break from thinking about your friendRelax recharge and approach the situation again when youre readySometimes a good cry can be cathartic If you need to cry find somewhere youre comfortable and let it out In the midst of these strong feelings for your friend you may neglect taking care of yourself But practicing selfcare in this time will help you regain confidence and maintain supportive relationships as you process your emotions Do activities that strengthen your physical and emotional wellbeing and take care of your personal hygieneEmotional selfcare might include Reading a book spending time with a friend listening to music getting a massage or learning something newPhysical selfcare might include Going for a walk exercising getting enough sleep staying hydrated or scheduling a medical checkup Humor really can be the best medicine Comic relief can help you destress and keep a light perspective in life Watch a silly movie read humorous novels or visit a local comedy club At the very least laughter can distract you when you need time away from your thoughtsSometimes people use humor as a coping mechanism in hard times Make sure that youre not using jokes to repress painful feelings Getting your feelings out whether in words art or song will help you collect your thoughts and process all the emotions you might be feeling You can share your work with others or you can just keep it for yourself The important part is expressing yourself fullyIf youre not the creative type start a journal Seeing your emotions on paper will help you work through them While getting over a crush on your friend your selfesteem may plummet You may worry that nobody will ever love you like you wish your friend did Believing in yourself again can help you cope with the pain and cultivate hope in the future Write down your strengths on a piece of paper to remember when youre feeling low and set reachable goals every day to remind yourself that you can do hard thingsSometimes low selfesteem is a symptom of depression which is not as easily cured on your own If you think you may be depressed consider telling a loved one or seeing a counselor
If youre having trouble getting over this person because of their good looks try to think of some of their other flaws For example think of a time when this person behaved in a mean way toward you or your friends You cant get anywhere in life just by sitting there and looking pretty
If your crush has no idea you exist its going to be difficult to attract him Try to get to know each other by becoming acquainted with his friends joining a club hes in or asking someone who knows him to introduce you Be careful because if you dont want him to know you like him they might say something which could ruin your chances and make things uncomfortableIf your crush is in your class talk to him a little before or after class talking during class could get you some unwanted negative attentionYou could comment on the teacher the work you have to do or make a joke when hes listening Its scary but youll feel good once you make a move Say something like âThe homework was hard last night Were you able to figure it outâ to start a conversation with him  Its easier to start conversations when you both have found something to talk about You might possibly consider taking up some of his interests but dont become a whole different person just for someone else Its definitely not worth it If you have no common interests dont freak out just ask him about his hobbies or about something you already know he enjoysFor example If youve never watched a TV show before that hes practically addicted to just tell him ask him about it to spark an instant conversation You could say âHave you ever seen â to get him talking about something he is a fan of and will get excited about   You have to be friends before he will start to reciprocate the whole crush feeling in return If you arenât already friends you could always start out by bringing up a general conversation topic ie weather a crazy thing that happened that day presidential elections assignments and if all else fails you could always just ask for a pencil or some paper and go from there   Maybe after youve gotten to know him a little better you can joke around or tease him maybe even flirt with him  but dont get too ahead of yourself He might feel awkward if a girl he barely knows starts flirting hardcore with him Add him on Facebook or follow him on Twitter or Instagram if you havenât already done so You can learn more about your crushâs interests and hobbies by doing this as well You can âlikeâ his posts whenever you see them to indicate your interest in what he posts and talks about   Guys are generally attracted to and notice people with a good sense of humor especially those with playful personalities Try joking around with him or teasing him if you are comfortable doing so Being able to make him laugh could be attractive to himFor example you could lightly joke around by saying something like âIâm short because I actually escaped from Willy Wonkaâs factoryâ or something silly along those lines to show that you are confident in yourself but you enjoy a good laugh
Dropping hints is a great way to start getting the message across if you are sure you want more than a friendship try having one thing and sharing it If you have something in common with him use it There is no doubt about it flirting is the key to opening the door to a new relationship Of course you need to make sure you are not overdoing it but you also want to get the message across   When he says something funny to you laugh Only laugh if its funny to you because youd want him to know the real you Still even if his jokes arent all hilarious at least smile Boys love seeing your smile Just dont overdo it if you can help yourself Be yourself at all times Tease him every now and then Dont make it too harsh though Just give him a smirk and tell him he totally failed whatever he was trying to do If he usually does it well thats an okay time to tease him But if he is working hard on it and just cant get it right its probably not the best idea to tell him he did poorly Send him notes or put messages in his backpack Write small things like I wish the day was done or What are you doing for summer Sending him notes will make him feel special and singled out by you If you think it might work give him a little wave with your hand Dont be discouraged if he doesnt wave back If he smiles back at you youll know it worked If that doesnt get you noticed try winking at him Winking is a universal sign of affection Make sure that you only close one eye when you wink or else it might just look like youre blinking  We all like our personal space but were eager to give it up when it comes to that special person Touching him gently in social situations will signal that you dont just want to stay friends   Ask him for help on a math problem and brush your shoulder against his Stay close to him for a while if he doesnt move away Touch his forearm or his shoulder when youre talking to him Dont grab hold of him like youre going to shake him just tap him or rest a few fingers on him for a moment and try to do it casually If he wears glasses and you see that they are slid down a little then slowly and gently walk up and push them up to the top of his nose As you do that rub your hand on his cheek and smile Be gentle If he smiles that means he enjoyed it If he backs you off then hes not interested or you pushed to rough If you have a playful relationship with him you can get away with more physical contact Ask him for a piggyback ride not when youre wearing a skirt or tickle him when he least expects it   Be happy when you look at him and try to project that happiness as much as possible Being happy is attractive and smiling is the way you show the world youre happy   Dont conceal your true smile Remember that time you laughed so hard you couldnt breathe Remember the smile that was plastered on your face afterwards Show him that smile Your confidence will be infectious You can tell hes interested if he smiles back at you and tries to hold your eyes a bit longer than regular friends would This means he gets pleasure out of feasting his eyes on you Try smiling at him as you stroke your hair This will bring his attention to both your great smile and your fantastic hair   This can be difficult to do but it will give you more chances to talk to him The more youre around him the more hell take notice   In classes if seating is optional sit next to him every so often Sit next to him at lunch when theres an opportunity Join the clubs that hes in unless theyre something like boys sports teams Try to find clubs that you both like so that youll do fun activities together and enjoy yourself while youre at it If he plays sports or does other activities make it a priority to go to his games or see him perform Theres nothing like scoring that winning touchdown and seeing a cute girl in the stands Be careful about being around him all the time You dont want to look like a stalker so be selective and play things off like theyre random Plus they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder   When the two of you are in the same class look at him from wherever youre sitting and when he looks back turn away and blush This sends him nonverbal information that you enjoy looking at him   Do not stare You want him to think youre interested not obsessed Occasionally look his way and if he isnt biting dont sweat it Send him a note or talk to him and see if he looks your way the next time When he turns to you look him in the eyes and smile Remember if he catches you looking at him that means that he was looking at you which means he probably likes you Score Always keep good eye contact when talking to him even if hes shy Show him how pretty your eyes are and how he makes your eyes smile with delight Keeping good eye contact shows him hes got your undivided attention but also that youre one confident gal   Be sincere about what you compliment and dont make it seem cheesy The best compliments say something sweet about a persons character   When he gets a haircut for example ask him where he got it If you tell him you like it youre saying that you like his style and paid attention enough to notice Try complimenting aspects of his personality Tell him he was loyal not to snitch on his friend or sweet for giving up his lunch Going beyond surfacelevel compliments is important Try to work the compliment into a bigger conversation If you just say I love your shoes he might not know how to react Find a way to talk about shoes in general and gradually let him know that you like his shoes more than his friends which are just ugly   Give him something boyish and thoughtful It might seem weird to give him a gift but just pretend like youre giving it to your best friend   Whatever it is make him think it wasnt a big deal by saying something like I came across this and I thought about you Dont buy anything too extravagant or expensive Get something small enough so that he wont feel like he has to get you something in return Pick up an extra pack of gum or that bottled juice that he always gets during recess You might even get him a notebook or pens especially if he always forgets them If you dont mind asking him out get him some tickets to a movie or sports event Tell him I thought we could go together Whatever gift you give find out his interests first Youll want to get him something that he actually likes â something that shows youre thinking about him and you like him for who he is   Dont call him every day and talk to him for hours but dont be afraid to take that next step and get to know him Calling him is a sign that youre serious about getting to know him better   When you call him find excuses to talk to him Ask him what the homework was what time the party is going to be or what he knows about the latest cell phone Be creative Talk about something weird that happened in school or something interesting about his life Listen well and be sure to pick up on the little details that he mentions Use them to build on old conversations and to bring up new ones Exchange information and perspectives This is your chance to get to know him and his chance to get to know you Talking on the phone can be enjoyable for boys if they feel funny and interesting doing it so make sure to laugh at his jokes and sound excited If hes not talkative be sure to ask him lots of questions Ask him what his parents do where he grew up what he wants to be later on what his siblings are like or where he wants to go on vacation Asking question will help move along the conversation and tell him youre interested Dont keep him on the phone for a long time he might have other stuff to do Always maintain a little mystery about yourself You want him to get to know you but you also want to leave him curious about learning even more   This is risky because his friends may distort information or tease him dont worry theyre jealous so you have to be careful about who you tell But sooner or later his friends will bring it up to him and the ball will be in his court   Use this as a kind of last resort If all the above steps dont work consider telling his friends Again you will have littleno control over what his friends tell him Dont tell his friends that you want them to pass it along Just find a way to mention it to at least one of his friends â theyll most likely do the rest If you really trust them tell your friend to accidentally spill it to him Because this is tough to do have someone who is really casual do this If they dont do it casually it can feel like youre demanding him to make a decision about you You want him to feel flattered not caught in a corner   You can try indirect flirting all you want but it might not have an effect Sometimes guys need you to spell things out really clearly   Ask him to walk with you after class is done If he says he doesnt know nudge a little more and say Youre going to leave me all by myself If he says he cant hes not interested If he says he can try to flirt with him when you are walking together at the end of he day If he says yes immediately hes definitely interested Ask him if he wants to be your date to a dance especially if its Sadie Hawkins If he says yes plan what you want to wear together so that you can be colorcoordinated Ask him if hell carry your heavy backpack for a little while It doesnt need to be all day but tell him that its hurting your back and that he looks strong enough to carry it If he says yes hes definitely into you and likes that you think hes manly
When it comes to break ups facetoface interaction is optimal but there are a variety of reasons why writing a letter might be the best option   If youre in a long distance relationship communication can sometimes be difficult even over a phone or web cam screen Some people are also simply uncomfortable with phone calls and if thats the case for you a letter might help you get your words out in a calm straightforward fashionIf your partner might become hostile or emotional during a facetoface break up preventing you from explaining your point of view a letter might also be a better option Closure and open communication is important for a clean healthy breakup and if you dont think your partner will allow this facetoface it may be better to write your thoughts out in a letter  A breakup letter should only be used as a last resort Unless youre experiencing one of the extenuating circumstances from above its better to try and communicate facetoface   Facetoface communication is ideal because nonverbal cues can provide comfort during a breakup A smile or hug for example can tell your partner he or she still matters even though the relationship is ending Such moments are absent when breaking up happens in letter formA breakup letter can also be somewhat cryptic If theres anything your partner does not understand he or she will be unable to ask for clarification A lack of closure can leave him or her emotionally scarred and entering a new relationship may be difficultIf you truly feel a breakup letter is the best route despite its drawbacks leave room open for communication Tell your partner he or she can call you or see you in a few days or weeks to talk if he or she needs to do so facetoface Give him or her time to cool down however so you can both talk calmly as adults   Delivery options are important in regard to a breakup letter You want to make sure you deliver the letter in a way that does not come off as cruel or spiteful   Email Facebook and other electronic means of delivering the letter are probably a bad idea As some many people now have smart phones that means all day internet access You do not want your partner to open the email on his way to work school or any event where he needs to stay focused Mailing the letter may be necessary if youre in a long distance relationship However give some kind of heads up Do not pretend things are normal after youve sent the letter Give your partner a headsup to expect a letter and tell him or her youve expressed some things you feel are easier to discuss in a written format If you live in the same town you could deliver the letter yourself or have a friend or family member do so   A breakup should be a clean break with no room for ambiguity You should be honest from the getgo you want to end the relationship   The letters intent should be obvious from the opening line Easing someone into a breakup seems less cruel but it actually comes off as a mixed message It can easily be read as uncertainty making your partner think theres a chance you might change your mindYour opening line should be concise Begin with a simple sentence that communicates the letters intent Something like I have come to the difficult decision to end this relationship or something along those lines works This comes off as certain leaving no room for confusion Breakups can be difficult and cause a lot of feelings of failure and anxiety for both parties Open communication is important as it removes the stress of not knowing Your partner deserves to understand why the relationship ended so providing specifics as to why you feel things arent working out is vital to a breakup letter   Informationsharing is an important aspect of any relationship In a breakup sharing the reasons you feel the relationship should end conveys you respect your partner and want him or her to have closure The idea of a winner you as youre leaving and a loser your partner as hes being left are diminished if youre honest The blame is not on one individual but rather the incompatibility between the two of youEven if your partner did something that made you unhappy avoid namecalling and blaming Simply state the specific behavior that resulted in incompatibility Instead of saying Your friendship with your ex is damaging to our relationship try to state it in a way that focuses on your personal feelings rather than applying objective facts For example The fact you and Jane are still so close makes me feel it would be difficult for me to trust you longtermSpecific behaviors that were damaging to your relationship are important for your ex to know He or she can use this information to improve his romantic relationships in the future If you phrase things in a nonconfrontational way it may be helpful for him of her in the future to know why a past relationship endedRemember its not always something the other person is doing Sometimes incompatibility causes a relationship to end If this is the case say so This is often easier to accept and your ex will not end up feeling bad or guilty about past mistakes Say something like I feel that we ultimately want to end up in different locations and as Im getting older I want to find someone Im compatible with in the longterm Remember as youre not facetoface the nonverbal cues that can be reassuring are absent Kindness is important in a breakup letter You want your partner to understand that even though the relationship has ended they still matter   While you need to be firm that youre ending the relationship theres no need to be spiteful or aggressive while doing so Even if you do have feelings of resentment expressing yourself is an aggressive way could lead your ex to retaliate with his own letter or an angry phone call End the letter by saying something positive like I valued the time we spent together and I hope you find someone you work better with in the future The absence of nonverbal cues can make you come off as cold so you want your ex to feel that you do care and that he or she is valued even though the relationship is over Another reasons kindness is important is that letters bind you to your words In anger or sadness we often say things we do not truly mean and you do not want you or your ex to carry around physical evidence of a regrettable phrasing or tone   When a relationship ends its important not to deny or minimize the feelings of sadness that follow You need to experience your breakup in order to get over it   Grieving is a normal part of a relationship ending Even if you know the decision was for the best you will likely miss your partner in the days and weeks that follow the breakupMany people deal with such feelings by avoiding them People may take up a big project or start socializing or drinking heavily However this is not a good idea Ending a relationship especially a serious and longterm one is one of the most difficult emotional blows a person can endure in life You need to be able to accept and face the pain to process the emotions youre feeling about the loss Biology plays a factor in how we cope with breakups Understanding your biological functions in the wake of a failed romance can help you better cope   The human brain is wired for bonding so the breaking of any bond is emotionally difficult A breakup can be similar to drug withdrawal as the feelings of longing for another person remain even weeks after the relationship has ended Areas of the brain associated with drug use are activated during romantic relationships and so youre biologically wired to miss someone and feel regret or loneliness in the direct aftermath of a breakupUnderstand such feelings are temporary and as time passes they will lessen While past relationships do affect how you function in current relationship the acute feelings of pain lose intensity with time Oftentimes in order to justify or dismiss a relationship people indulge in ruminating over things they disliked about an ex Such negative thoughts do not help you get over someone They simply increase the amount of time you spend thinking about an ex prolonging the process of getting over someone Instead try to focus on the positives and look towards better prospects in the future

Think about something that youâve done recently that makes you proud Try to conjure up the details of this accomplishment right before you know youâre about to run into your crush If you run into him unexpectedly then take a few seconds to think of what you can do and compose yourself   For example you might think of a time when you werenât clumsy such as when you won that marathon the other day You could also recall how you improved your grades in a certain class If you work hard enough at anything you can improve it  If youâve just tripped or if you start stuttering calm your nerves by exhaling and inhaling a number of times before continuing Try inhaling slowly as you count to five then exhale slowly as you count to five This will allow you to collect your thoughts and refocus before proceeding   If your crush questions what you are doing you might say âOh Iâve just got a lot going on I was trying to clear my mind so I could pay attention to youâ   There is a great deal of power in positive thinking So if youâve had a bad day and something happened in front of your crush then you might want to tell yourself âItâs just one dayâ or âI can do thisâ Eventually you will start to believe your own words   You might say to yourself âYou have too much going on to worry about this Letâs move onâ Or âLetâs make tomorrow a better dayâ   If you find yourself closing your body off after an embarrassing moment force yourself to adopt an open stance Uncross your arms and legs Lift your head and look around Make eye contact with those persons near youYou can also subtly flirt with your crush by touching your face or neck You may notice that they start to mirror your movements as well   Start paying close attention to your body and your emotions If you notice that you start to feel jittery right before you get really clumsy then use this as a sign that you probably need to go sit down somewhere Or if your mind feels as if it racing before you begin to stutter then try to calm down before speaking Take a moment to recall how youâve survived all sorts of crazy incidents in the past This will remind you that you are a survivor In fact many of the incidents that you remember canât even be recalled by your crush When you feel as if you canât go on just think about how youâve had this emotion before and youâve done just fine
This is an indirect but potentially effective way to get back in touch This is something that you can do to build up your courage to talk to her or this can be a primer for starting a conversation Liking her posts or retweeting her tweets will remind her of you and let her know that you are following her posts   Do not like everything she posts Choose one or two things that you genuinely like and space out the time between your likes to every few days If you send too much attention to her all at once it may come off like you are trying too hard Do not like only the cute pictures of her You can like one photo where you feel like she looks particularly good but if you like too many pictures of her looking pretty you may come off creepy Consider liking a variety of things that she posts rather than just her pictures  If you have been liking or commenting on her posts provide her with material to comment back on Post clever or interesting thoughts you have about the world and people share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken or find funny gifs pictures or quotes from the internet that you can post along with a comment about why you like it   Consider what she would find funny or interesting You donât want to post things for her however you want to take into consideration that her internet style might be different from yours Take a look at her posts and the things she likes to get an idea of her online interests and style For example if she writes a lot of posts about bands she likes and you share a band you like in common you can post one of their music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it Stay true to yourself Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are It can come off fake if you are posting about things you havenât shown an interest in before   You should make a comment on a post that she writes early after it has been posted If you write the comment early she will be more likely to respond Look for things that she is into that is a common interest you share like your music taste love of food love of movies etc Consider praising the post asking a question about it or commenting about something you find interesting about it   For example if she writes a post about going to a show you can respond âI am so jealous you got to see them Did you think they were good liveâ Hopefully your comments will spark a chain of comments back and forth If this happens you should send her a message asking her how she is doing or extending the conversation Say âHey I am enjoying our conversation How have you been Are there any other bands you have been listening to lately that I should check outâ   Follow the inline citations to learn how to create an event on either platform You can either create an event or you can invite her to an event you are attending For example if you are going to a music festival that you think she would like invite her to the event There are several events that are open invite You can send her an invitation by going to the page of the event and sending the invite from that page Or if you and your friends are throwing a Halloween party for example make an event for it and invite her   After you invite her you should send her a follow up message saying hello and telling her about the event Say something like âHey my friends and I are having a Halloween party and I was thinking it would be great to see you again Are you free for Halloweenâ If she cannot come to the event use the event as an opportunity to continue messaging her Ask her about how things have been going and start a conversation with her   Whichever way that you decide to reach out to her you can follow the same tactic as writing a comment Send her a message with a praise talk about some common ground that you have or ask her a question Send a message that praises her for something she has recently done or accomplished For example if she recently finished a program or got a new pet for example send her a message saying congratulations and then ask her how she has been lately Talk about something that you share in common For example if she did a hike recently and you also like to go hiking send her a message that say something like âI saw that you went on a hike to Palm Canyon I was just there a couple of months ago and really enjoyed the waterfalls did you like the trailâ Ask her a question about something she has posted Say something like âI saw the pictures you posted of you surfing what kind of board do you have I love surfing and go every chance I getâ
Every now and then give your crush a sincere compliment Tell them something you like about them Maybe theyâre really funny or smart Perhaps they have a cool talent or skillFor example you can say âYouâre an amazing skateboarder How did you learn all of those tricksâ Donât shower them with compliments or they may feel uncomfortable   Laughing shows that you are interested in what they are saying When your crush says something funny laugh or giggle gently Donât overdo it though or it may seem insincere Your crush may be just as nervous about talking to you as you may be talking to them To help them out check your body language Smile when you catch them looking at you Instead of crossing your arms try twirling your hairWhen your crush walks towards you donât look away Instead make eye contact Wave if you want to catch their eye

If you feel that you are having to lean to one side to keep your balance or keep upright its probably because the saddle was either placed on incorrectly or has shifted because it is loose You can know for sure by looking at the pommel the horn that you hold with one hand while riding If the horn or pommel the knob that sticks up on the saddle for the rider to hold is not in perfect alignment with the horses mane the saddle has shifted offcenterThe saddle may have shifted because it was too loose or it may have shifted because you are putting too much weight on one stirrup and not evenly distributing your weight this happens all the time especially to new riders and especially if youre riding the horse in circles You can try to shift the saddle back by putting your weight on the opposite side stirrup but if the saddle moves too easily it is probably too looseDismount and adjust it   While you might do a lot of bouncing out of the saddle if your horse is trotting or cantering the saddle itself should never leave the horses back If its moving up and down as the horse moves it will injure the horses backIf the saddle itself seems to leave the horses body as you trot you must immediately dismount and tighten the girth   If youre not sure if the saddle is on properly dont keep riding even if youre worried that others will think you dont know what youre doing Every rider has to adjust the saddle sometimes and no one will think less of you for putting your horses comfort and your own safety first   If someone is with you they can inspect the cinch for you This is more reliable than doing it yourself since your weight in the saddle will cause more give to the girth and make it looser Have the person check to see if they can pull the girth itself an inch or more away from the horses body while you are in the saddle If they can its too loose You most likely will not have to repeat all the steps again but you will need to loosen the tie and unbuckle the girth from the horses left side to retighten   Make a note of what position the buckle is in before you remove it and then ensure that you tighten it to the next notch or two if the saddle was very loose as you recinch it

While pets are loving additions to your home they are not always easy to manage All pets require time money and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed You need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the longterm   Most pets require attention and maintenance during the day so make sure youll be home enough to take care of your pet If you have kids consider what pets will be kid friendly Hamsters and fish for example make great early pets If you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldnt consider a pet until you are more stable   Even different types of dogs have different needs so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means Before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like Dont go into this decision deadset on one species or breed  being openminded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family Keep in mind some general concerns with different pets    Dogs  though dogs vary widely by breed all dogs need lots of attention time to exercise and plenty of room to roam  Cats  Intelligent and individual cats will be fine with less supervision though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out  Hamsters Gerbils Ferrets and Rodents  Economical and shortliving rodents make good first pets They often however have strong odors  Fish  Fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive and wont cuddle anytime soon Think of having a fish like having a garden  Lizards  Happy on their own and generally easy to care for lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick  Birds  Birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud They are also expensive and occasionally temperamental especially bigger birds like parrots   Curious fooddriven and unable to listen to your warnings pets can get into trouble if you dont create boundaries or safe spaces Birds may dart out of open windows lizards can scamper around the house and dogs or cats may run into the street Take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach   Remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food If you want your animal to have outside time consider putting in a fence Put aside one room that you can designate as the pets bedroom Aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other   Talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things youll need  housing toys grooming supplies etc  and shop before you bring your new pet home Teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page   If you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by feeding a doll or regularly watering plants   Pets are not ultra expensive but that doesnt mean you wont need to spend money Below are some annual cost estimates provided by the ASPCA    Dogs 600900 depending on size  Cats 600  Rabbit 700  Rodents300650 depending on size  Fish  40 Small Birds  400  Large Birds Parrots Macaws 7001200 Set aside a few hundred dollars in case of emergency veterinary costs   Be sure to bring your pet to the vet soon after adopting it as well Just like humans pets need regular checkups to spot problems before they become serious conditions Use your first visit to discuss how often you should schedule checkups and your pets dietary and medical needs   Be sure to schedule shots and vaccinations as soon as you can Ask your vet what symptoms to look for if your pet gets sick Spay or neuter dogs and cats to prevent pet overpopulation Record your vets number as well as the number of a veterinary hospital in case of emergencies   The cheapest food you find may not always be the healthiest Feeding animals table scraps  no matter how cute they are when they beg  is not a good idea since people food often has minerals and items in it that can be harmful to our animal friends Only feed your pet appropriate foods and give them responsible portions   Research or ask your vet about good food sources and portion sizes Natural foods though more expensive are healthier than dry or processed foods  Though this is certainly true of dogs and cats even fish and lizards require dedication and love to really thrive Animals are social beings much like humans and you need to set aside time to play with your pets so they get exercise and mental stimulation   Give your pet room to roam  the bigger the animal the more room theyll need Buy toys and playsets for you and your pet to use together Give your pet the occasional treat after good behavior to motivate it and cement good habits   This will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy Create a regular cleaning schedule at least once every 23 weeks and stick to it cleaning your animal and its living spaces to prevent disease and odor   For larger pets like cats and dogs there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses Keep up with regular grooming such as brushing fur or scrubbing scales every few days For dogs and cats make sure you keep their nails short so they dont break painfully  While these steps are general guidelines for pet ownership each animal is different and you need to adapt accordingly Ask friends who have similar pets check out books from the library and search internet discussion boards about your breed or species You can never know too much   Be flexible once you bring your pet home Pets have personalities and will have different wants and needs
Generally people like to kiss people who are groomed and have clean teethYou want to look presentable   If you are a crunchier person donât worry about the grooming as much There is a nobility in cutting down on water usage and hygiene product production that some will find more attractive than clean hair  Experiencing something new activates adrenaline and heightens awareness which together make meaningful memories and can help you create a stronger bond with your special someoneTry going bouldering a form of rock climbing that doesnât require a harness Donât worryâthe walls are pretty short If thereâs a restaurant or bar youâve both been wanting to try out go together   While some people certainly do kiss in public places not everyone loves PDA especially for a first kissTalk about pressure   If youâre at a party you could ask if your partner wants to go on a walk or to talk in a different room Say something like âItâs so noisy and crowded in here Want to go get some fresh airâ It can be scary to ask someone out first but if youâve been crushing on this person and never gone on a date itâs important that he knows youâre interested Ask him if he wants to come over to watch a movie just the two of you   This will vary based on where you are and what your evening plans look like   The most important thing is to be warm and approachable Itâs easy to be standoffish if you are nervous but no one will try to kiss you if you are If you want him to make the move you have to help him feel confident that you are open to it Make sure to smile Just as your guy needs to feel that youâre approachable he also needs to know that youâre enjoying yourself with himIf you invite him over to your house for dinner or a movie make sure the space is clean and the air smells inviting Atmosphere is everything   If you really like someone and feel nervous when youâre with him you might subconsciously box yourself off from him accidentally Donât do this Of all flirting techniques physical touch works bestGently touch his arm when he says something funny You want him to know that you are OK with physical touch   If you are sitting down to watch a movie make sure you sit in close proximity to him Let him sit down first and snuggle in next to him You can hint at him by making eye contact and occasionally looking down at his lips He should pick up on the fact that you are imagining what it would be like to kiss himDonât go too overboard with this If youâre not in conversation donât stare him down or he will find it creepy If youâre sitting down watching a movie you can occasionally look over at him let him catch you looking then turn back to the movie Heâll know youâre thinking of him   Women are more successful at flirting when they are bold and direct studies showMen tend to prefer when women are direct about their intentions   You can say âIâm so glad weâre finally on a date togetherâ People love hearing that theyâre wanted Get him to ask what youâre thinking about If youâre feeling bold say âOh Iâm just wondering what it would be like to kiss youâ  If you can find a natural way to initiate it play fighting can lead to a kissâthink of The Lion King Itâll increase your adrenaline it gets you close to each other and it shows that you feel comfortable with him Just make sure that it is playful not violent If he knows that you like him enough to be nervous it will make him feel more comfortable No one likes to be vulnerable and if he doesnât know that youâre feeling nervous too he might be too afraid to make his move   For example you could say âIâve been wanting to spend time with you for a while I didnât think Iâd be so nervousâ   If all else fails you can tell him that you want him to kiss you and see what happens Sometimes guys fail to pick up on the hints and you need to be more direct   You could say âIâd really like for you to kiss me right nowâ If you want to be slightly less direct you can say âIt would be OK if you kiss me right now if you want toâ Donât rush into this Enjoy the beginning of the relationship and if itâs been several weeks and youâve dropped hint after hint just tell him He may be looking for your OK to go ahead or he may want to kiss you in his own time

Itâs easy to think that others are after your man even if youâre not the jealous type Consulting with him gives you a second opinion as yours could be a little skewed   You could say âDo you think my friend has feelings for you I feel like I am seeing signs of it but Iâm not sure What do you thinkâ Take what he says to heart However look for signs that he may also be into your friend and is hiding it These signs could include lots of eye contact text messaging finding excuses to be alone with your friend and acting differently when around them Your man may give you subtle signs that heâs picking up romantic vibes from your friend Pay attention to what he does when heâs around them You may see signals that he feels uncomfortable or is looking to you for help   For example your boyfriend may look at you with widened eyes when your friend talks to him or acts inappropriately He may also turn his body away from them and towards you when the suspected flirting occurs Are your boyfriend and friend texting each other Do they share inside jokes Do they often leave you out of the conversation If so you have every right to speak up about it if you donât like the way they behave This is particularly so if you believe they may be having an affairFor instance you could say âI love that you and my friend get along so well However Iâm not comfortable with how you two act when youâre around each other It makes me concerned that something else may be going onâ He will likely change his behavior if he truly cares about you and wants to make you feel more comfortable It may be a sign that he enjoys the attention and likes your friend if he isnât willing to stop   Try not to take your frustrations towards your friend out on your boyfriend They are to blame not him Getting mad at him may make him pull away from you and create the opposite result of what you want
Pull yourself together so that you have the guts to ask your crush what hisher email is Take a deep breath in count to 5 and exhale this will help relax yourself Play out the situation in your head and think about what you want to say  To get their email you have to find them first Look for them in places they usually go to After youve spotted your boyfriend crush or girlfriend walk over casually and strike a conversation dont walk up to them and ask for their email right away then leave as this will only seem rude Once he or she is about to leave suggest trading emails   Just drop it if he or she says that they do not have an email address or if they decline your offer If they say no be cool about it and dont bug them about it in the future   Make sure the person confirms they do have an email address and dont be too anxious about sending an email to them however dont email them the day you trade emails as you may seem desperate to the person

Avoid oneonone encounters with your crush until youve practiced getting your nerves under control Hanging around in a group setting will take a lot of pressure off of you and make you feel a lot less selfconscious Even if they dont know about your crush your friends being there will lend the moral support youll need to relax  You dont have to go overboard But if you overheard that your crush may be heading to the same party as you Wear your best jeans rather than the comfortable pair with one hole too many The worst case scenario means you just spent the night looking marvelous for everyone else   Eye contact can be difficult when youre nervous Constantly staring at your shoes when your crush is around is decidedly uncool A pair of sunglasses will make things easier by letting you appear to look directly at your crush without actually having to make eye contact   Dont wear shades at night or indoors Above all you want to look natural in front of your crush People dont normally wear sunglasses away from the sun Your shades may look out of place and draw unwanted attention If you can look your crush in the eye skip the shades Maintaining eye contact makes you look more confident It can also subtly single to your crush that youre interested without saying a word Controlled breathing works twofold It keeps you mentally relaxed and prevents you from getting winded When people are nervous the jitters can often show up in their voice and they may find themselves gasping for air while standing still   If you feel yourself starting to blush breathe deeply through your nose Deep breathing will calm you and reduce flushing in your face Talk about topics youre knowledgeable about and ask your crush about what interests him or her Try to make sure everyone involved in a conversation gets a roughly equal amount of time to speak Ask your crush questions about his or her goals and aspirations Try to stick to positive topics and answer questions about yourself freely You dont need to be guarded to look good in front of your crushUse these conversations as an opportunity to learn more about your crush so that you can make an educated decision about a possible future relationship You may find out that the two of you are incompatible Or you may find out that your crush already has a significant other or is not attracted to people of your gender If thats the case you will need to let your crush go   When we want someone to like us it can be tempting to put on a persona you think your crush wants in a significant other While pretending to share interests and viewpoints may win your crush over in the shortterm you wont be able to build a real relationship from white lies Its better to be honest and stay yourself Instead of pretending to know everything about his or her favorite hobby share something about your own   People are attracted to confidence not narcissism If youre trying to build yourself up in front of a person you like it can be easy to go overboard Bragging about your accomplishments will simply make you look insecure Dont be shy to mention your talents but only if its something that organically comes up in conversation If its not something you can picture yourself saying to a group of friends without cringing dont say it  An example of what to avoid while still looking your best If you were accepted to a prestigious university and youve heard your crush is attracted to intelligence you may feel tempted to tell him or her Mentioning your acceptance when it is irrelevant to the conversation is definitely showing off Depending on how exclusive the school may be you even simply bringing up the topic of college plans may come off as bragging Wait until the subject is brought up organically in conversation to tell your crush about this achievement He or she will probably be impressed with both your intelligence and humility   Under normal circumstances you may be able to do a backflip with ease Around your crush you may be nervous enough to flub your moves Wait until youre relaxed before showing your crush a neat trick that has the potential to embarrass   Discussing other peoples negative traits will actually make your crush perceive those same bad traits in you Instead talk positively of other people to make the reverse come trueThis is especially important if you and your crush dont know each other very well While gossiping you may let a careless judgmental word slip that seriously offends your crush Also even if you barely ever indulge in damaging gossip a crush who hasnt been around you long wont know that Make your crushs first impressions of you positive ones
Be sure it isnât all about his looks Get to know him first so you can be sure he isnât a jerk Take opportunities to chat with him in class or in the hallways Without getting to know him you may eventually realize you donât have anything in common Maybe you enjoy his positive attitude or sense of humor   After working on your confidence and identifying why you like the boy itâs time to jump in and talk to him Make sure you talk about things he likes or the conversation may die quickly For example if hes on a sports team tell him he played well If youâre still feeling shy find ways to be around him in a group because he still might notice you if you smile and make eye contact   They can be sources of information such as if he likes you or the kinds of things that interest him Ask them about activities they enjoy doing togetherYou can even talk about classes you have together or ask for help in a certain subject Then you can use this information to make conversation with the boy youre trying to impress   If his friends reveal anything personal about him be careful not to mention this to him He may think youre prying   After talking to him for a little while an opportunity to ask for his number may come on its own For example if youâre walking on a class project together thatâs the perfect time to ask   Connect with him on social media if he doesnât have a cell phone If he doesnât have his own phone where you can call and text him he might be active on social media Mention Twitter Facebook and Instagram and add him on those sites Mention previous conversations or something he might find interesting if youre looking for a way to initiate a dialogue on social media   Just a little bit of flirtation will get the message across You dont want the guy to think that youd flirt with just anyone Make him feel special about getting some attention from you   Dont talk about other guys While you may not mean anything by it this could send the wrong message to the boy youre trying to impress He may think youre interested in someone else

Be sure about your decision  Im sorry but I dont think were compatible or I dont feel there is potential for a relationship here are answers that are far preferable to I dont find you attractive or I feel that you are boring which will unnecessarily hurt hisher feelings   This may lead the person to believe that you would date them so unfortunately they may pursue you even more   If the person persists be very clear that this is your decision that you are moving on and that they should move on as well   Beware though that if you maintain the friend thing heshe might not give up so easily
You dont want to start initiating a kiss in a location that isnt opportune Youre looking for somewhere secluded and where you can hopefully sit   Passion cant always be planned out in a step by step process You need to be flexible and able to easily adapt with the mood of your partner A boy will be into it if you are spontaneous and confident If youre going on a walk and see a picturesque trail then grab his hand and pull him along Exploring places with someone will increase your security and bond together   This can be the hardest part about passion and kissing Only go with this guy if he does something for you Not just buying you material products but if he excites you or makes you laugh he may be worthy   Periodically through your date with this guy you should give him slight physical attention You dont need to overdo this but every once in a while grab his arm when he says something funny

A closed body position is one where her body is pointing away from you her arms are crossed or she is hunched over to take up less spaceClosing her body position sends signals that she is uncomfortable or nervous about something If she is doing this consistently in a relationship it may be a sign shes not that into you If your girlfriend used to stand close to you with her arms down or on her hips but now she turns away and crosses her arms when you talk she is telling you that she isnât interested in talking anymore If she conveys closed body language every time you are together it is probably time to rethink your relationship because she might be wanting to end it  Eye contact is an important factor in body language and can convey a personâs emotionsIf your girlfriend keeps her eyes locked onto yours while you talk then no problem but if you find her avoiding eye contact something may be wrong If she darts her eyes around looking at many different things while you talk to her it might also be a sign that she isnât enjoying the conversation or being with you   Physical touch is one way that girls use to flirt with and show interest in a guy Things like putting her hand on your chest holding your hand or brushing her fingers through your hair all show that she is interested in youIf your relationship started with a lot of physical touch from you but now she hardly gives any at all it could be time to talk to her about where the relationship is going A change in the amount of public displays of affection like holding hands can also be a warning sign When a girl isnât interested in a guy anymore she might stop touching him all together and go out of her way to avoid any sort of physical touch   Cancelling plans is a red flag that something may be wrong While circumstances often occur with valid reasons to miss a date if it happens more than 50 of dates youâre in the danger zoneWhen a girl starts to repetitively cancel plans or is always busy she is sending a clear message A girl that is interested in you will make herself available and want to spend time with you so if you find your girlfriend constantly ditching plans take it as a sign If you see a pattern of canceled dates or if she constantly has other plans it is time to sit her down for a heart to heart   If she is always inviting friends to meet up with on your dates or suggesting group or double dates this could be a sign that she doesnât like being alone with you anymore If she is constantly leaving in one room to go talk to another group of people this might be a sign that she doesnât enjoy spending time with you anymore Likewise going to parties and social gatherings without inviting you is also a sign that something might be wrong with your relationship Girls like to talk so if your girlfriend is calling or texting a lot less than she did in the beginning of the relationship then consider it a warning If you are constantly the one making the calls or sending the texts first it might mean she is beginning to lose interest in you If your girlfriend is checking out or flirting with other guys in front of you she is probably looking to get out of the relationship   If she talks about other guys more than she mentions other girls or if she consistently compares you to other guys it might be a sign that shes ready to end things She could be friendly to everyone but if it comes on suddenly there are many examples of comments that should raise a flagâThat guy in my math class is so smart I bet he would be a good tutor for meâ or âI met this guy at the gym yesterday and he was lifting 150 pounds He couldâve lifted meâ âThe new guy is kinda cute I wonder where heâs fromâ   Girls will naturally get a little jealous if you flirt with or check out another girl in front of her She may also get mad and this could easily lead to unnecessary confrontation or push her awayIf your girlfriend doesnât care that you are flirting with the waitress on your date then you might want to reconsider your relationship Try flirting with or being overly friendly to other girls on a date to see how your girlfriend reacts   Fights are bound to happen in all relationships but if they start occurring more frequently there might be a problemIf arguments over little things start to become big blowouts every time you should take some time to evaluate your relationship She may be starting to lose interest in you romantically   The best way to have a good relationship is to be honest Ask her openly how she feels and be willing to work through any problems if you want to stay together Give her your full attention and participate in the conversationRephrase what she says and repeat it back to show you understand Just to be sure I understand youre saying Allow her to speak without interrupting or arguing Ask questions to clarify and elaborate on what she is saying   Through honest communication you can discover the root of a problem if one exists Once shes shared her feelings youll be able to determine how to move forward in your relationship   There may be nothing wrong and youre overthinking things If she is ready for things to end bringing up the problems may make it easier to handle If shes upset and you want things to work youll know what you need to change to keep her happy
You dont have to spend hours crafting your breakup speech but if you care about the boy at all you should put a little thought into what youre going to say before you say it Figure out how youre going to give the boy the bad news how youll prepare him for it and what reasons youll give for the breakup Remember that you dont have to tell him everything if you dont want to If youre breaking up with him because you just dont like him anymore find the nicest way to say that you just dont think things are working out   If the boy has hurt you or done something really terrible then you dont have to feel bad about being honest with him If the break up is pretty much his fault then you might as well let him know  Letting the boy see that things arent going so well before you actually break up with him can help ease the pain Dont kiss him hug him and act like everything is perfectly fine or he will be really confused  and even more hurt  when you do finally break up with him If youve decided that the best time to break up with the boy is in a few days then dont go on any romantic dates or show him extra affection before then Just act a little more distant than usual so he may have a sense that something is up   This doesnt mean you should prolong the pain for weeks But if you know youre going to make a move in a few days slowly remove yourself from the relationship in the interim   Dumping someone over email or text is really not the way to go unless you dont care about the person at all If youve only dated for a few weeks and youve decided that the guy is a real jerk then fine send him a text saying I dont think this is working out Im sorry and move on with your life But if the person means something to you then make an effort to meet him in person and to give him the news facetoface This will let him ask you questions and get more closer than finding out that hes dumped from a phone or computer screen if you think he deserves this level of respect then give it to him   If the boy has a violent temper or youre afraid that he might hurt you after you break up with him then this will be another situation where its better to break up in person If you and the boy are doing the long distance thing and you know you wont see each other for a month or two you may want to break up with him over the phone  its better to do it as quickly as you can than to prolong the pain until you see each other   You dont have to wait for weeks for the perfect moment to present itself for you to dump the boy But you should try to pick a time when both of you can be alone relatively free of stress and in a neutral place where you can have a meaningful conversation Dont dump the boy an hour before his math final or his baseball game or youll be causing him extra stress that he wont be able to deal with right away Try to pick a time when you know hell have nothing to do afterwards and when you have enough time to really talk to him   Ask the boy to meet you so you can break up with him Try not to make it sound too obvious or hell show up filled with dread Pick a place that doesnt mean something special to you guys  avoid the park where you always hang out or the place where you went on your first date Do it outside a library or somewhere quiet after school if you have to If you pick a place that has special meaning for you both then thatll make the process more difficult Though dumping the boy wont be easy no matter where you go the more you plan ahead the more likely youll be to minimize your pain   You can be nice first and make a little bit of small talk but theres no point in dragging it on As soon as youre ready take a deep breath and tell him that its just not working anymore Say that youre sorry if you are and tell him that you want to break up If hes been nice to you then you can say something about how he was an amazing boyfriend and that you had a great time with him but theres no point in feeding him lies if you were miserable and just wanted to get out   Make eye contact and speak slowly Let him see that this is hurting you too even if youre the one doing the dumping   You dont have to give him a blow by blow of exactly why youre dumping him  in fact that will only cause him more pain and make him feel even worse about himself If youve met or fallen for someone else maybe you dont want to tell him that and hurt him any more as long as you dont think he will find out anyway If you just arent into him anymore you can find another way to get around that like saying that you cant make time for him or that you think youve become different people but he may be able to see right through that   If he hurt you then you wont need to give him an explanation of why youre ending it Hell know what he did   If you still respect him then you can give him the courtesy of letting him talk to you and ask you some questions If hes just repeating the same thing over and over then it wont get you anywhere but if he genuinely wants to know more about why youve chosen to dump him you can let him ask some questions as long as you dont think this will hurt him more   He may ask if he could have done anything differently even if he could have theres no point in telling him so because youve already made your decision Answer any questions you feel comfortable answering but if its all starting to feel a bit repetitive then you can wrap things up   Theres no point in being mean to the boy  even if he has really hurt you You want to end the relationship with your head high and not leave him with extra bitter feelings toward you Your relationship however long or short it was must have had some high points and you want him to remember you fondly dont you Theres no point in undermining all of the great and notsogreat experiences you had together just by being mean at the end   If you feel the urge to say something really spiteful hold your tongue Remember that youre the one doing the hurting and its likely that the boy is feeling a lot of pain   Keep the conversation as short and sweet as possible Theres no point in dragging it on or youre both more likely to say hurtful things and to feel more pain Also the longer you stay with the boy the more likely youll be to doubt your decision and to feel some regret But dont let your feelings of nostalgia or disappointment confuse you into thinking you have done the wrong thing   Tell the boy you have to go once youre done and make an excuse for why if you have to If he thinks you have nowhere to go then he may want to keep you around for longer   Remember that this is a breakup not a negotiation Dont let the boy beg you to stay with him or promise that hell change if you decide not to dump him after all Your decision is final and theres little chance that the relationship will be any different if you go back to round two The boy may tell you how much he likes or loves you flatter you or even beg you and cry  but you cant let yourself back down under any circumstances Stay strong and walk away no matter what the boy is doing   Just keep saying Im sorry but Ive already made my decision Let him know that you werent asking for his opinion on this one   Though its unlikely that youll walk away from the break up as best friends try to leave the boy with a fond memory Dont run away after name calling or yelling at him and dont storm away either He may want to do that but you have to take the high road and stay positive be as friendly as you can and tell him that youre really sorry about the way things ended He may fling insults at you but you cant stoop to that level   Give him a hug if hes open to it But be warned that he may be so hurt that he wont want to touch you   Lets face it  it can be nearly impossible to be friends with your ex and its definitely impossible to be friends with your ex right after a breakup So give him some time to cool off let your own emotions settle and stop being in touch with him for as long as it takes to heal Dont start having awkward lunch dates a month after the break up because you think thats the mature thing to do if you still have residual feelings youre only making it harder for both of you to move on   Theres no magic formula for how long it will take for both of you to let go of your romantic feelings Each relationship starts and ends at its own pace so dont feel bad if you still feel confused about the whole thing after a few months   Once you dump the boy you should enjoy spending some time with your favorite person  yourself This isnt the time to go crazy hook up with random people and socialize with your girlfriends nonstop Though these things can help you forget the breakup youll be able to deal with it more thoroughly if you give yourself some time to stay in write in your journal take walks read a good book or do whatever you have to do to feel centered and like yourself again   Take the time to do the things you didnt have much time to do because you were always with the boy This will make you appreciate being by yourself even more   Once enough time has passed and you feel whole again you can slowly start to date other boys Take a risk and let a friend set you up on a date or accept the coffee date the cute boy in your history class has proposed You probably wont fall in love with the first  or the third or the seventh  person you meet but thats not important The important thing is that you open up your heart again and get ready for love once more   Dont rush in to another relationship just to stop thinking about the boy you dumped Rebound relationships are almost always doomed to fail   If enough time has passed and you can really think of the boy without any lingering romantic feelings  and if he can think of you the same way  then you may try to be friends after all Remember that in many cases this simply wont be possible so dont be frustrated if you cant seem to hang out with your ex without feeling frustrated or confused But if you really do like each other and want to hang out as friends then take it slow and start hanging out in fun casual settings and see if you can rebuild your friendship   The tricky part here is making sure that you both are ready to just be friends Since youre the one who ended the relationship it may take a little longer for the boy to be ready to be your friend
One of the simplest ways to be closer is to find activities and interests that you and your crush both like Talk with your crush about something they like Identify the interests that match your own and spend more time on those activitiesConsider asking things like Whats it like being on the soccer team I used to play soccer or I noticed that you like to draw What kind of things do sketch I like to sketch in a journal sometimes Do more of the activities that you both enjoy Just make sure that not all your time is spent on this Look at the ways that you and your crush are different Sometimes getting to know someone involves seeing how common interests may be different in approach  Though your romantic feelings may be hard to control its important to get to know the real person that is your crush Wouldnt you want that person you like to be someone you also want to be friends with If you dont feel like your crush would be a good friend or that your interests are too different think about what that may mean Would you want to be close with someone who you dont think would be a good friend Allow your friendship to lead into romance rather than the other way around Dont rush into something Try to find ways to keep your mind off your crush and focus on how to be their friend first Consider asking your crush and his or her friends to hang out with you and your friends for a weekend event Keep the interactions casual at first rather than trying to find out if he or she likes you   Make an effort to listen to what your crush likes Be positive and smile Give signs that you are listening to what he or she is saying Dont be distracted by other things Dont avert your eyes due to shyness   When you actually listen to what your crush is saying and not just think about the way he or she looks youll be able to really know what the person is like After listening consider responding with Thats really interesting or Wow thats cool Ask followup questions When you are actively listening to your crush youre paying attention to what he or she is saying Ask for details about what they are talking about or clarification if something sounds confusing   Its important to be your true self Be honest about what you like and dont like Dont try to be fake or someone that you hate Think about what things matter to you   Act and dress in a way that feels comfortable and

There is no one perfect way to find out if a girl thinks youre cute and signs that one girl likes you may be a sign from another girl that she isnt interested The only way to get around this is to spend time with a women The better you know her the better youll be able to read her and figure out if she thinks youre cute   Shy girls often stay quiet avoid eye contact or maintain some distance especially if they like a boy and are nervous he might find outLouder outgoing girls may act friendly or flirty with everyone making it harder to see who they actually think is cute The more you know her however the more youll see how she treats the ones she really admires  If you can spend time alone this is always going to be best You cannot tell if a girl is into you if youre always off on your own or if youre trying to judge her from afar You need to spend quality time with her even if it is just casual to see how she treats you   Sit down next to her in class or at lunch or join her games at recess Any time spent nearby will help show you how she feels Invite her to group events where the pressure to be together or romantic is low and you can casually see how she feels by her response to the invitation   A big indicator of attraction is how she responds to conversations Is she looking away making up reasons to leave or sitting silently whenever youre not talking If so chances are good she is not interested in you However if you give a pause or lull in the conversation and after a second or two of silence and she reengages you by asking you a question such as âwhere are you fromâ âHow about you Do you like xyzâ that is a sign that she wants to keep the interaction going on between you two and see where the vibe is headed unwinds This is an important precursor to her thinking youâre cute   Body language is not the only way to see if someone thinks youre cute but it is a great way to gauge how someone might feel about you Good signs include   Touching you especially on the arms or back Smiling frequently at you Making eye contact Turning and facing you during conversations especially in group settings Agreeing frequently showing that she enjoys similar things Teasing is one of the best ways to subtly see where her heart is at You never want to be mean but making jokes having small competitive challenges in class at recess or at work and slightly making fun of her for mistakes is classic flirting If she engages back teasing and joking with you there is a good chance she thinks youre cute   Note however that some people are shy and dont show their affection this way If she doesnt joke or tease back but still smiles and seems interested she might still think youre cute   If you do this observe whether the girl pays more attention to you or her friends If it is friends then you know she isnt crushing on you but if she pays more attention to you then you know that she is crushing on you She may try to impress you make lots of jokes or spend most of her time talking to you   Find a friend you both have in common and ask their opinion Often another friend has the outside perspective needed figure out if their is mutual attraction Know however that this can quickly turn into a rumor that leaves all of your friends asking do you have a crush on her Only ask trusted friends their advice and keep it to a minimum You cant control what she thinks about you but you can control how you act around her Be a gentleman by listening to her when she talks and offering to help her out when possible She may not think youre cute now but with simple easy gestures like holding the door open or asking how she is doing each morning you can give her a great impression to remember you by   This may be the most terrifyingseeming action in the world but that doesnt make it any less important The only way to really know if she thinks youre cute is to let her know you find her cute This doesnt have to be a grand enormous profession of love In fact it shouldnt be  it should be casual and lighthearted Let her know I think youre cute give a light smile and move on if she rejects you More likely than not however this little complement will open her up to say how she feels as well
If your good friend has a crush on you then they may start to suddenly be curious about who youâre dating If they never cared about who you were dating before but are suddenly showing interest in who youâre dating and asking lots of questions about it chances are that they wish you were dating them instead   If your friend asks how your dates went all the time when they never used to care then they may have a crush on you If your friend always asks âDo you think itâs seriousâ or âDo you really like themâ after you go on a date with a person then they may just be nervous that youâre going to get attached to someone else If your friend gently puts down any person you date or even says âTheyre not good enough for youâ then they might think that theyre the one for you instead Another sign that your friend is crushing on you is that while your friend used to love hearing the details of your dating life theyre now oddly quiet whenever it comes up It may make them upset to hear all about the romantic life of their new crush  Your friend might have even said that they want to date you and you havenât even noticed it Here are some ways that they could have done it   If your friend suddenly says things like âI really like talking to youâ and theyve never mentioned it before they may be developing a crush If your friend has made a lot of comments about how much they want a partner they may be directing this toward you If your friend hypothetically asks you what you think it would be like if you dated thenâduhâtheyre giving you a big hint that they want to date you   If your friend is the type to always give elaborate compliments then fine but if your friend rarely praises you and is suddenly telling you that you look nice that they like your new outfit or even says that something about your hair or eyes then theyre probably hinting that they want something more   Pay attention If your friend has never complimented you before and has suddenly started being very complimentary to only you then it may mean that they want to take things to the next level But if theyre suddenly complimenting every potential romantic interest in sight then it may not mean anything

Take the extra 10 or 15 minutes you need to look your absolute best before you see your crush Even just small things can change you from someone in the background to someone who catches their attention Not only can looking your best make your crush notice you it can also give you the confidence boost you need to approach your crushPay attention to your hair Even doing a quick comb through can make a big difference For girls especially straightening or curling their hair can give them a confidence boost If you wear makeup make sure that it is applied well and will last all day Also make sure that you are taking care of your body in general by getting enough sleep and taking care of your skin so you look fresh and healthy  Dressing differently than the people around you is a good way to get noticed This works especially well if you are in an environment where everyone dresses in a similar wayIf people at your school dress similarly or in uniform wear a statement necklace or a pair of cool sneakers to catch the attention of your crush If you are in a professional work environment wear something that is appropriate but different For instance wear a collared shirt with an interesting pattern or a sparkly headband   If red is your color go for it Studies show that both genders are more attracted to people when they wear red Pull out a red dress or shirt from your closet to get your crushâs attention If you donât like wearing red choose another bright color to help you stand out from the crowd When trying to impress a crush itâs easy to take it too far You want to look nice but remember to wear clothing thatâs appropriate for the situationFor instance if your crush is in your yoga class donât dress for class like youâre headed to the red carpet Remember that everything is better in moderation This goes for perfume and cologne as well   Do your best to be in the line of sight of your crush If you are in the same class try to sit near or in front of him If you see him at the gym work out nearby Do this until you are sure that your crush has seen you and knows that you existDonât do it to the point where youâre around your crush more than you should be Thereâs a difference between making sure your crush sees you around and stalking your crush   Get involved in whatever space you see your crush If you go to school with your crush join a sports team or an extracurricular activity If you volunteer with your crush take on more hours Becoming more involved will make you more visible and show you as a person with drive and purpose which are both attractive qualities
Every morning take a shower Wash your hair brush it out and keep it styled the way you like Put on deodorant Even if youâre already friends with the boy you desire poor hygiene will hurt your chances by showing him you donât care about yourself   A little makeup perfume or cologne can help If you choose to use these put on just enough to accentuate your features such as a suitable lipstick and eyeliner Donât let makeup appear thick or perfume smell overwhelming  When you know youâll be around him dress to impress Pick out your best clothes or buy some that fit your figure The clothes you wear should not be tight but they should fit you well Good clothing also helps increase your confidence which makes you appear more desirable to him   Even after you start spending time with him make yourself look presentable as much as possible Wearing stained sweatpants is easy but it shows you arenât trying to look good for him   Practice walking around your room Keep your head up and your back straight Take small steps neither too fast nor too slow When you sit maintain your posture never slouching or hunching Also donât cross your arms or else youâll appear closed off Once you can do all of this in your room go ahead and try to maintain good posture in public Practice speaking out loud at home and to a mirror Your voice should be loud and clear Eliminate unnecessary pauses as these will make you sound timid or uncertain Know what you want to say and say it If you speak too fast slow down Add breaths between sentences and give time for others to listen and speak Once you feel comfortable at home try speaking confidently to friends and strangersAdd in humor to emphasize your confidence Donât overdo it but every once in awhile itâs okay to joke with the boy or someone else around you Start out by speaking into a mirror then move on to practicing this on friends acquaintances and strangers   Approaching someone is difficult but itâs even more intimidating when youâre interested romantically Start out by asking for or offering help commenting on a shared experience such as a school class by complementing or by making an observation such as about what the personâs eating for lunch Examples include âI found that class really difficult What did you think of itâ or âI see you like the sandwiches here Iâm not much of a turkey typeâAs you get him to become more comfortable with you progress the conversation Learn more about him such as is interests Return the trust but donât go overboard If you already know him youâll have some familiarity with him but youâll still need to talk and build more of a connection   By talking to him you should be able to find out what he likes Now connect the two of you by finding activities you can share If you both like bowling for instance youâll be able to talk about bowling and then go bowl Donât think of this as a date Instead focus on having fun togetherBeing willing to try the things he likes is a good idea but pretending to share his interests makes you look false and like you have less individuality Go out as friends You need to create moments that help you grow closer which wonât happen if you come on too strong or overanalyze your interactions   Even if hiding your personality seems to be working itâll hurt you in the end At some point youâll have to show him who you are in order to work towards a relationship Now is the best time to reveal yourself and judge whether he will get along with you If you like pop music clothes romantic comedies and video games for example allow this to come out naturally Donât hide your true self Physical contact is a great way to make him associate the pleasant feeling of touch with you Choose opportune times but let your contact appear unintentional When talking to him touch his hand or wrist Stand close to him in crowds Brush against his shoulders while passing   When youâre first starting out with him keep touch brief and not too intimate You want to build his interest and coming on strong can make your affections seem less valuable in the long run   At opportune times lock onto his eyes Eye contact is difficult since it will often make you feel vulnerable but it is powerful At a party pick him out of the room and meet his eyes for at least a moment When youâre talking or doing something fun meet his eyes and linger for a momentThe eye contact in these moments should feel intense If it doesnât thatâs a sign that you still have to work at getting closer to him   You want to be around him so you have to treat him like you value his company Encourage him during difficult times If he had a rough day reassure him Wish him luck for tomorrow Support his goals Never turn against him when someoneâs fighting with him Instead show that you appreciate him by complimenting his positive qualities and actionsThis includes focusing your attention on him Donât get distracted by the attention from other boys   A relationship canât operate without trust Over time show him that he can open up to you about whatever he thinks or feels Listen to him without judgment and donât gossip with your friends The gossip even if it doesnât come back to you will make him reluctant to tell you anything and will stop you from bondingTo build this trust youâll also have to share your own life when appropriate Confide your fears hopes and problems   Look at the signs and adjust your approach If heâs interested in you heâll want to be around you and make excuses to be close Heâll lean towards you keep his legs and arms uncrossed his hands unclenched and have his toes pointed at you He may also make extended eye contact or look down bashfullyThese are only signs so they donât guarantee he likes you enough to be your boyfriend Continue spending time with him to gauge his feelings If he doesnât do many of these signs he still may like you He may be good at hiding his feelings or shy If his body language is negative stop what youâre doing Readjust your behavior by repeating steps He may simply not be into you Mirroring body language often helps If heâs tilting his head while looking at you keep your head tilted too for instance   Eye contact and gentle touch are starts to more serious flirting Start making your intentions more concrete Come up with clever lines at opportune times that show you appreciate him and arenât afraid to show it For example tell him âYou should wear that shirt it makes you look cuteâ before you see him Add in appropriate touches such as putting a hand on his shirt as you pick up the material between your fingersDonât go overboard on this Appear cool and controlled or else you run the risk of smothering him with attention   You want to spend time with him but too much time means youâre too close You have to make him want to be with you and miss you while youâre not around Donât tend to his needs all the time Put down the phone on occasion after you let him know youâre going out and make yourself seem socially desirableEven in a relationship you need to live your own life Tend to those other aspects such as friends school or work   Itâs important that you donât smother him either Being needy demanding all his attention is a sure way to extinguish any feelings heâs developing Keep your own distance from time to time The absence can make him realize how much he needs you even if the space you gave him came from something like sleeping in and missing his texts for a few hours Itâll be tempting for you to stalk his social media or go through his phone when he leaves it near you Doing this makes you look controlling It shows that you have no trust in him so you feel justified to invade his personal space and spy on him Donât question him about every little detail that comes from him interacting with other people   Invading his privacy this way also makes you look insecure which will undermine his desire to be in a relationship with you   Good hints start moving you beyond the friendship stage These can be as simple as noticing what heâs wearing or complimenting his personality Saying âYou look cute todayâ suggests you have enough interest to notice him while easing him towards an escalation in your relationshipAvoid coming on too strong Allow him feel that youâre a valuable catch he has earned Judge his reaction A compliment can encourage him especially if heâs keeping his interest a secret If he shows no reaction go back to working on attracting him or move on   Once your relationship starts to escalate itâs easy to get wrapped up in the moment You want him to be around you so you demand more of him while exaggerating his qualities Keep calm and stick to the plan of spending some time tending to the other aspects of your life Accept him for who he is if you wish to make him into a boyfriend   Many people think they can change their partner inside of a relationship If you find yourself thinking this itâs a sign that heâs not right for you Keep his expectations of you in line too Donât be highmaintenance   If he hasnât already made a move you can push the issue a little One option is to ease him into it by asking what he would do if you were his significant other When youâre ready to take the risk be up front with him Choose a quiet intimate moment Either come out and say it or ease him into it by starting off saying âSo Iâve been thinkingââ Explain to him you want a relationship and ask him what he thinksIf he doesnât come right out and commit chances are his feelings arenât strong enough Giving him a little space after you ask can help if heâs shy or hesitant   Sometimes heâs not right for you It can hurt to put in this effort and find out he doesnât share your feelings Walk away Donât maintain hope or else youâll hurt yourself by waiting for him Also donât try to force him to be with you This only makes it less likely heâll have feelings for you Go on and live your life There are plenty of boys and maybe someday youâll even run into this one at a better timeRemember that a good relationship is one that works for both of you He may not be a good fit
Body language can often give a guys true feelings away  no matter how hard he tries to hide them Though body language tricks dont always tell you exactly how a guy feels they can definitely predict whether or not he views you in a romantic light Here are some signs that may mean hes really into you   He turns his hips toward you even if hes facing the other direction He will look up at you smile and look back down If he catches you looking at him hell smile He never puts his hands in his pockets or crosses his arms while talking to you He may lean toward you when he speaks He may turn his feet toward you If he turns them away from you when youre sitting down next to each other then he may not be interested He may accidentally brush up against you when youre talking or touch you lightly with his hands  If he takes a longer route to class just to walk past you or if he offers to walk you to a class thats nowhere near his next one he probably likes you He may even make excuses for why hes suddenly near you like asking to borrow a book you know he owns This will be his way of letting you know he wants to spend more time around you   See if he offers you a ride home though he lives on the other side of town See if he waits around seemingly for no reason until you show up   The bigger the difference the bigger your advantage For example he might burp or swear in front of his friends but try really hard not to do those things around you If hes trying to be on his best behavior he might like you If he thinks of you as one of the guys then he may not try to act super refined around you   If he treats you just like a pal cursing belching and telling you about the people he has crushes on then you may have entered the Friend Zone   If youre hanging out with your friends and the guy comes along pay attention to how he treats them If hes into you then hell want to make a strong impression on your friends so that theyll tell you how awesome he is Guys know that girls like to talk and if he likes you hell be smart enough not to give your friends the cold shoulder The next time he goes up to you and your friends see if he becomes extra courteous to them and goes out of his way to be nice to them   The same goes for your family members If he sees you around your mom or siblings and tries extra hard to be nice he may be doing it because he likes you   If hes into you then hell want to show you off If hes secretive about going off to meet his friends then it may be because he likes just having guy time  or because he likes guy time because it lets him hit on the ladies But if he does want to introduce you to his friends its a great sign It means that he wants to show you off  and that he doesnt think youll get in the way of any potential womanizing   There is one exception to this rule however he may not want you to meet his friends because heâs too embarrassed of them   If hes into you then hell go out of his way to do nice things for you He may pick up lunch for you when youre having a busy day he may get the homework assignments for you if youre sick from school or he may give you a ride when you need one Think about it is he just a really nice guy or is his behavior toward you suggesting something more If hes always doing nice things for you and doesnt seem to be picking up lunch for anyone else then chances are its because hes really into you   He may even text you asking if he can help you with something small just as an excuse to talk to you If he tries to spend as much time around you as possible even if itâs through helping you out then heâs definitely into you   The next time you hang out with the guy and a bunch of your friends see if he naturally ends up gravitating toward you If it feels like hes always by your side in these group scenarios then its probably because hes into you Otherwise why else would he talk to you instead of his buddies or the other girls around   It may not happen immediately but if you find that you two always end up having long conversations at the end of the night or sitting down next to each other when the whole gang goes out to happy hour then this may be a sign that hes really into you   This can be a big indication of how he really feels about you If hes really just a big flirt then hell be treating every girl the way he treats you If he teases flirts plays around with compliments and gives a ton of attention to every girl that comes his way along with you then yeah he may not be singling you out But if youre the only girl hes flirty with  or the only girl hes more reserved with  then it may be a sign that hes into you He may actually like you and can therefore feel too shy to really flirt with you instead of other girls he doesnt really care for   This can be confusing but it makes a lot of sense The main thing is to figure out if he treats you differently from the other girls   When youre out of sight are you also out of mind If you and the guy dont see each other for a while and he doesnât check in at all then you may not be on his mind But if you find him texting you calling you or just popping in to say hi when you havenât hung out in a while then he may be really into you The same goes for social media â if he comments on your Facebook posts or favorites your Tweets a lot then this may be his way of letting you know he cares   If youâre online see if he tries to chat you on gchat or Facebook to catch up This can be another sign that he wants something more from your relationship   Another way to see if heâs really into you is to see if youâve already been going on dates without knowing it If a lot of your hang outs are already intimate and date like then this may mean that heâs really into you Here are some things to look out for   Do you go on coffee or lunch dates If he meets up with you during the day not after heâs had a few drinks with his buddies then he may see you as relationship material Do you hang out solo a lot Do you go to the movies Go for walks Just watch TV together Then guess what â you may already be going on dates without knowing it Does he plan hanging out with you days in advance If so then heâs really serious about making sure he spends time with you   If heâs really into you then he may try to show off around you and to let you know how awesome capable and brave he is This may be somewhat outdated and does not apply to all guys but it may be the case that heâll try to steal the show if youâre around just to make sure he catches your eye When heâs doing these things see if heâs looking over to see if youâre watching Here are some things he may do in front of you   Casually start showing off a talent like dribbling a basketball or a soccer ball Conveniently pick up a guitar and start strumming Jump off tall structures into water to show you how brave he is Challenge his friends to friendly fights or contests   Of course you may be the next Sarah Silverman but if he laughs around you all the time it can also just mean that heâs laughing because heâs into you and is naturally a little nervous around you If he laughs more than normal at your jokes or even laughs a little bit at regular comments that arenât even all that funny then this may be a surefire sign that he likes you   The next time youâre together pay attention to how much he laughs Try to notice him with others â does he always laugh so much or does his laughter seem to be more intense around you   This is a nobrainer If heâs really into you then he may be more nervous than normal because heâll be afraid of messing up He may laugh more sure but he may also stutter forget what he was going to say ask you the same question twice within ten minutes repeat himself trip over himself for no reason or just generally act nervous and adorable because he really cares what you think of him   The next time youâre around him pay attention Does he fidget Does it take him a while to ask a question Does he make selfdeprecating comments If so then it may be because he likes you and doesnât quite know how to act   This is another big one If you have a class together or if you happen to be in the same place see if you can catch him looking at you This is another surefire way to see if he has feelings for you The only problem is if you try to catch him staring at you all the time then he may think that you have a crush on himâwhich you do But if you can be discreet about it try to see if heâs looking at you the next time youâre near each other   If he catches you catching him staring and blushes and looks down at the floor then this is an extra sign that heâs into you   If heâs into you then itâs only natural that he cares more about what he looks like when heâs around you You may catch him doing some of the following things when youâre together   Running his hands through his hair Trying to straighten his clothes or remove any stains on them Discreetly checking himself out in reflections   If a guy calls you by your nickname comes up with a new nickname for you or refers to you by a pet name this is a big sign Anything he says that makes you feel special and that shows hes taken a unique interest in you can tell you that hes really into you   Also watch for him saying your name more often than he absolutely needs to See if he talks slowly and more softly when he addresses you This means that hes letting his guard down because he likes you See if he makes eye contact when he talks to you Though he may look away occasionally eye contact shows that hes paying attention to you   When you know hes in the same room with other people pretend you dont notice hes there See how long it takes him to spot you and how long it takes him to come over and say hi Less than a few minutes means hes probably interested However if it takes him a bit longer to say hi to you it may just be because hes really shy   You can also try to see how he reacts when you enter the room Does his entire face light up or does he barely change his expression   Anytime you hear him say anything negative about a guy it means that he sees this guy as a threat â especially if its another guy you know well He clearly wants you to only pay attention to him not anyone else If you mention a guy friend to him and he immediately acts suspicious it may be because he thinks you may have romantic feelings for the other guy   If he knows youre going on dates and often says things like That guy isnt good enough for you then he may just be saying that he thinks that he is good enough He may also tease you about liking other guys youre just friends with This could be another way for him to show that hes thinking of you romantically   If hes really into you then hell be more likely to tease you all the time You may think hes just being mean or making fun of you but if you find that hes giving you special treatment and always teasing you it may not be because he thinks of you as his kid sister If you find that hes poking you in the ribs giving you a silly nickname playfully making fun of your outfits or otherwise generally teasing you then it probably means that hes really into you Why else would he make the effort   Teasing is a big part of flirting You may not even realize that he thinks hes flirting with you when hes being playful   This can be a big indication of whether or not hes really into you He could be bragging about all of his womanizing in an effort to impress you when he really just wants you to chase after him He could also be telling you that he just cant find the right girl because he really just wants to be with you If you find him even saying that no girl he meets is as goodinterestingcoolpretty as you then yeah hes basically telling you that he wants to date you   If he constantly says things like âI can just never find the right girlââ then this may be his way of telling you that this girl is standing right in front of him   If the guy is really into you then he may start opening up to you and treating you as more than just a casual friend Just make sure this doesnât mean he just sees you as a best friend though If he wants to take things to the next level then he may begin to tell you things that he wouldnât tell just anyone Here are some things he may talk about with you if heâs interested in you   His childhood His hopes for the future His relationships with his family or friends Some of his secretly dorky hobbies Anything that comes after âIâve never told anyone this beforeââ   At the end of the day the best way to really know if heâs into you is just to ask him Donât ask his friends donât ask your friends to ask him for you donât ask him in a note or a text but be brave and venture out and ask him yourself If heâs too shy to do anything then your potential future relationship is in your hands Itâs not as scary as it sounds   It doesnât have to be the most perfect magical place but pick a place where you can have some privacy without either of your friends around and a time when heâs not likely to be stressed or to rush off somewhere If you want to up the romance factor you can ask him in the evenings or at a place that is special to you both   Make some small talk but then ask him how he feels about you You can tell him that youâve developed feelings for him and just really want to know where his head is Make eye contact but donât put the pressure on Try to keep it cool and ask him how he feels without putting the pressure on   If it turns out he likes you then you can privately celebrate You can both decide where to go from here And if not itâs not the end of the world and you donât have to torture yourself by wondering what heâs really thinking anymore Be proud of yourself for being brave enough to ask him and move forward
If a guy tells you he likes you tell him the straight honest truth you donât like him back You can say it in a nice way like âThatâs really sweet but I just donât have feelings for you like thatâ or âI think youâre really cool and funny but I donât like you in the same way Most guys will take the hint and stop pursuing youMake sure to talk to him right away Waiting to act will only confuse him or allow him to keep thinking that he has a chance with you  Know that his feelings might be hurt but itâs your right to draw a boundary for what you want and are comfortable with   Stick with your rejection Use clear language like âNo thank youâ and âNo Iâm not interestedâ rather than âNo maybe some other timeâ or âNo not reallyâ Donât leave room for the possibility that youâd be interested later or he might get the idea that he has time to change your mind Tell him any good practical reasons why it wouldnât make sense for him to date you He might respond better to reason   If you already have a boyfriend or someone youâre interested thatâs an easy reason to give him If you live on the opposite side of town and wouldnât be able to easily see him outside of school or work tell him âWe live so far away we wouldnât get to see each otherâ If youâre going to a different middle school high school or college than him next year point out to him that this wouldnât work well   Itâs okay to tell a little white lie to make your point if he wonât leave you alone âIâm interested in someone elseâ âIâm already dating someoneâ or âIâm not interested in guysâ are all reasonable excuses to get him off your tail whether true or not   Ask a friend or think of someone else whoâs interested in him and then explain to him why that person might be a better match Make sure you have permission from whoever youâre setting him up with
As long as it feels reasonably safe say no immediately Do not smile apologize or say maybe If you dont want someone dont give them anything Just say something like No Im not interestedDo not allow anyone you dont like to touch you or stand close to you Step back if they are too close to you Turn away if they are taking too long to leave you alone For instance if you are at a party you might say No Im not interested then turn to your friend and suggest going to another room  If you are alone and the person hitting on you threatens you or makes you feel too uncomfortable to say no tell them a quick lie that will let you escape   You can say you need to use a bathroom or that you forgot something in your car or that you need to make a quick call Get into a public place and get help Put walls between yourself and the aggressor as quickly as you can Unstable or inebriated people sometimes attack even in public   Dont give them your name information about your job where you live where youre going next or anything else If you arent sure yet if someone is hitting on you or bothering you just ask why instead of answering the questions and then decided if you are being advanced uponExplain that you are not interested instead of answering questions If you are told It was just a compliment I just want to talk to you What do you do for work resist the urge to answer the question Instead say I am talking with my friends right now or I am not interested in continuing this conversation   Once someone has made you nervous put space between yourself and them If they dont leave you alone walk away Leave as long as you can leave safely without being followed Leave with friends if you can If you feel relatively safe you can stick around but dont agree to sit with or stand near the aggressor   Try going into another room leaving a bar or party with friends or moving to sit at the bar instead of at a table so that the bartender can watch out for you   If you yell at them they may try to hurt youBe as cool and firm as you can Take deep breaths if you feel yourself losing your temper or getting frightened Take special care to stay calm if you are alone as you are more likely to be violently attacked   If you are in public an abuser may try to upset you in order to discredit you Stay calm and make sure to let other people know whats going on   Tell somebody so that they can look out for you If you are at a bar tell your friends If someone is making you uncomfortable tell a bouncer or bartender exactly what happened so that they can keep an eye out for you and eject the person if needed   If it happens in the street tell the people you can see what happened If you were threatened report the incident to the police
Before you consider purchasing a saddle you need to make a firm decision on the specific type of riding you hope to do There are two general categories of riding english and western English saddles come in traditional english hunter dressage and jumper varieties Western saddle options include traditional western endurance barrel racing and roping styles  The chairlike area of the saddle that you sit in is known as the âseatâ Seats come in a variety of sizes for the multiple bodytypes riders have To measure your seat sit in a chair with your back against the chair back and your feet on the floor Use a soft measuring tape and measure the distance from your kneecap to the crease in your hip   Your seat length should vary somewhere between 1319inches for an adult You can visit an online seat converter and enter in your physical attributes weight height etc to get an immediate measurement instead of measuring yourself   Use your seat measurement to determine the seat size and therefore the saddle size of an English saddle The measurementsize approximately equates as   A legseat measurement of 165inches or less equals a 15inch saddle A legseat measurement of 165â185 inches 419â470Â cm equals a 16inch saddle A legseat measurement of 185â20 inches 470â508Â cm equals a 165inch saddle A legseat measurement of 20â215 inches 508â546Â cm equals a 17inch saddle A legseat measurement of 215â23 inches 546â584Â cm equals a 175inch saddle A legseat measurement larger than 23 inches 584Â cm will fit an 18inch or 19inch saddle The measurement of seat is a bit different for western saddles than it is for English saddles The easiest conversion is to subtract two inches from the size of your English saddle and youâll be left with the size of your western saddle Use the following chart to determine your Western saddle size based on your legseat measurement   A legseat measurement of 165inches or less equals a 13inch saddle A legseat measurement of 165â185 inches 419â470Â cm equals a 14inch saddle A legseat measurement of 185â20 inches 470â508Â cm equals a 15inch saddle A legseat measurement of 20â215 inches 508â546Â cm equals a 155inch saddle A legseat measurement of 215â23 inches 546â584Â cm equals a 16inch saddle A legseat measurement larger than 23 inches 584Â cm will fit an 17inch or 18inch saddle To tell if your english saddle fits you put it on a sawhorse or your horse and sit in it as you would for riding You should be able to fit four fingers on the cantle behind your seat If you canât fit at least four fingers the saddle is too small If you can fit a whole hand or more flat against the cantle the saddle is too big   Test the fit of a western saddle by sitting on it as you would for riding on either a sawhorse or your horse A wellfitting saddle will allow three to four fingers to fit between the forkswell and your thigh If you can fit more than four fingers the saddle is too large If you canât fit at least three fingers the saddle is too small Before you settle on a saddle be sure that it offers the correct stirrup length for your body type Although different styles require different stirrup lengths jumpers use short stirrups for example you can get a ballpark idea of your stirrup length by standing to the side of the saddle and pulling the stirrup up to your armpit When the stirrup fits in the hollow of your armpit it is close to the length you will require when riding   Place the prospective saddle on your horseâs back without a saddle pad or blanket Move it so that it is in the accurate position the front of the saddle should rest on the withers without blocking the shoulder and the back should go no further than the last rib bone Move the saddle back and forth a few times to find the âsweet spotâ   The gullet is the long empty space that runs lengthwise along the spine of the horse A proper fitting saddle will allow you to see all the way through the gullet when viewed from the back You should be able to fit 23 fingers stacked on top of the withers inside the gullet just below the forkswell western or the pommel english  If you canât fit at least 2 fingers in the gullet from the front the saddle tree is too small for your horse and will pinch their spine If you can fit more than three fingers in the gullet from the front then the saddle tree is too large and will cause rocking and saddle sores on your horse   The bars are the part of the saddle that form the gullet and hold the saddle on the horseâs back The bars run along the length of the spine and should be in contact with the entirety of the horseâs back if the saddle fits If the bars are too straight they will only meet with the withers and the croup of the horseâs back causing briding If the bars are too curved they will touch only the center of the horseâs back and cause the saddle to rock in between the withers and the croup   The bars flare outwards at the front and back of the saddle to prevent chafing and rubbing while riding If the saddle fits the front of the saddle tree should flare out slightly If the saddle is too small there wonât be any bar flare evident and it will be very uncomfortable to your horse   Some horses are very wide across their backs while others are very narrow To tell if the saddle fits your horseâs back size see where the bars sit If they rest very high up almost on top of the spine then the saddle is too narrow If the bars slide down very far past the spine then the saddle is too wide  The bar width is closely related to the gullet clearance a toonarrow bar width will cause a larger gullet space while a toowide bar width will cause little to no gullet clearance When you get the girth tightened on your horse you should be able to fit four fingers sidebyside between the front of the girth and your horseâs shoulders An illfitting saddle may cause the girth to fall forwards or slide backwards   Throughout the saddle testingfitting process keep an eye on your horse If the saddle isnât the right size or uncomfortable your horse will show it in their body language

If you want to get a bad boyâs attention then you have to show him just a tiny bit of interest before letting him see that youve got better things to do Just look at him for two seconds â try looking down and looking up through your lashes for an extra sexy effect â and then turn away Stare at him long enough to make an impression but not for so long that you look like you really care whether or not he likes you   Bad boys like girls who want to give them a run for their money They donât want girls who fawn all over them or give them their heart right away Once he notices you turn away That should give him enough incentive to pursue you Of course you can also take the initiative and pursue him first  Bad boys donât go for the girls who blend in with the crowd They go for the girls who donât quite fit in who are worth a second look and who donât try to look act or dress like everyone else If you have a funky fashion sense stick to it If you have an unusual laugh donât hide it If you love sketching playing the harmonica or practicing karate let him see what you love to do and donât be ashamed of it   Bad boys want girls who know what theyâre about If you look like everyone else and have nothing special going for you then he wonât be impressed If you stand out even if it means youâre not like most girls heâll be even more into you   A lot of girls are intimidated by bad boys because they think theyâre too cool to give them a second of their time If you want to attract one of them the best thing you can do is to show them that youâre not afraid of them at all Think of it like coming facetoface with a bear or a lion the second you show fear youâll be destroyed If he comes up to you donât back away and stand even taller instead If he tries to interrupt you then let him know youâre not finished speaking and say what you have to say   Bad boys are used to girls who bend at their will If you stand up to him and let him see you as an equal then heâll be truly impressed by you   Bad boys donât like girls who do what everyone else is doing Just because all of your friends are taking Art History take The History of Motorcycles if thatâs what youâre into If all of your friends love Taylor Swift have pride in your love for The Stones or more indie bands like Bottomless Pit If the crowd is lining up to see the latest Will Ferrell movie go for the indie flick youve been meaning to catch instead   Though you shouldnt be quirky or different just for the sake of being different if thereâs something different that you would genuinely like to do then you should go for it   Bad boys donât want girls who fawn all over them Instead theyâre looking for chicks who can take them or leave him If you start talking to him and are clearly having a great conversation you donât have to run up to him and give him a big hug the next time you see each other Instead give him a few minutes to come up to you and make him work for it If he texts you or chats you give it a few minutes before you get back to him Let him see that you have better things to do than to wait for him to talk to you and heâll want to talk to you even more   Of course you should be careful and make sure that you donât ignore him so much that he doesnt think youâre interested Find a balance between looking interested and making him work for it a bit You donât need to be rude to do this If he comes up to you and says hello you shouldnt ignore him but if he walks by you donât have to act like youve been waiting for him to come by and have been looking for him for hours   Bad boys love it when girls play hard to get If they feel like they can have you any time they want you then they wonât want to work for it Instead let him know you like him by flirting a bit or giving him a compliment or two but donât put it all on the line Let him reveal his feelings well before you do and donât accept every invitation he gives you make sure he asks you out at least a week in advance so he doesnt think your schedule is wide open and knows he has to work for your time and attention   If he calls you donât answer the phone on the first ring In fact give it an hour or two and call him back If he texts you wait at least half an hour to respond You donât want him to feel like youâre just sitting around waiting to hear from him   Bad boys hate girls who cling to their friends and care too much about what they think If you want to start a relationship with a bad boy then you shouldnt let your friends hang around too much until you get to know each other better You should also avoid saying âMy friend thinks thatââ when you talk about your relationship or youâll make him feel that your friends are way too involved in your personal life When it comes down to it bad boys really want girls who think for themselves   You should also avoid having your friends talk to the bad boy for you If you really want to win him over then you have to do the work yourself   True bad boys donât want girls who they can boss around They want girls who are confident enough to stand up to them and to believe in their relationship without questioning them every two seconds If you want to keep your bad boy hooked then you have to wow him with your confidence showing him how happy you are with how you look who you are and what you do Work on projecting a positive energy that shows that youâre content with being yourself and donât need anybody for validation   Focus on the positive and talk about the things that make you happy instead of complaining about things that arent perfect Donât gossip about other girls or youâll look insecure Instead praise them and the bad boy will be impressed Avoid seeking validation Donât act like youâre only beautiful or smart or interesting if he says so   To keep your bad boy interested you should take charge of the relationship Donât let him make all the calls tell you where and when youâll be going on your date or be the one who calls first all the time Show him that you know what you want and that you wonât go on a date lastminute because youve made other plans donât let him take you to a bike show if youâd rather be out to dinner and donât make him think that he has total control over you or heâll lose interest pretty fast   You donât have to take charge with every situation or that may get tiring but you should try to take charge at least as much as he does   Bad boys want girls with a thick skin and they donât want to worry about whether or not they hurt your feelings every two seconds Of course if the bad boy is thoughtless or even verbally abusive then you should ditch him ASAP but if he treats you well then you shouldnt second guess everything he says or does and be on the verge of tears if something doesnt go as planned You can show him your softer side as you get to know each other but itâs good to work on keeping that skin nice and thick so the bad boy knows he can roll with you   If you get upset every time he teases you or feel emotional if heâs five minutes late then youâll come off as a bit weak and insecure Learn to roll with the punches and only get upset when you have a legitimate reason to get upset Of course if he gets in the habit of being late all the time then you should say something but avoid getting prematurely upset or throwing a scene over something insignificant   Real bad boys want girls who give them a run for their money You should show him that youâre skilled and savvy and that youâre not looking for a man to teach you how to do everything While no relationship is great if youâre constantly questioning your partner if you keep him on his toes heâll be even more interested in you Donât get too comfortable with him and let him know that you want him to be dynamic and interesting and that you wonât settle for less   If he takes you to the pool hall donât let him wrap his arms around you and show you how to play instead beat him at his own game If he cites a fact about Metallica that you just know is false donât be afraid of calling him out on it instead of taking everything he says at face value   You may think that all bad boys only want bad girls but in fact a lot of them like girls who are more innocentseeming or who just like to do their own thing If youâd already call yourself a bad girl then keep doing what youâre doing but donât feel compelled to wear black leather or dark makeup to smoke cigarettes or to curse a lot if thatâs not really who you are Bad boys are much more attracted to girls who are true to who they are than those who try to be someone theyâre not   Most bad boys are just as attracted to good girls as they are to bad girls so you shouldnt worry too much about changing your image In fact sometimes bad boys and bad girls can be too much alike to be compatible Bad boys have low tolerance for fakeness and if you try to be someone other than who you are then theyâll be able to tell   If youâre really cool and hip then the bad boy will know it without you having to say so Avoid talking about how much your bike costs how youâre best friends with the lead drummer of your favorite death metal band or how youâre the best tattoo artists in East Oakland Instead let him figure out how awesome you are for himself If you brag too much thatâll be a sign that youâre just trying too hard to prove yourself   A true bad boy doesnt brag or show off either He doesnt like people who feel the need to talk themselves up too much   Most girls who date bad boys are convinced that they can change them Though there are some exceptions to this rule most of these girls end up disappointed when their favorite bad boy wonât change his ways If you want to really enjoy your relationship with your bad boy then you shouldnt try to domesticate him and make him do things he doesnt want to do instead you should appreciate him for who he is instead of making him take yoga or spend an afternoon with your Aunt Mildred if thatâs not what heâs into If youâre dating a bad boy then chances are that youâre not looking for marriage with him Though some bad boys can change if you want to enjoy your relationship with him then you should work on being present in the moment and enjoying every moment you spend together in the now instead of worrying about what lies ahead Have a great time hanging out with him dining with him drinking with him riding his motorcycle and letting your hair blow in the wind If you want the relationship to last then the best thing you can do is to focus on fun   When you find yourself constantly worrying about where the relationship is going you can have a talk with the bad boy about it but you should know that this could discourage him Think of your relationship growing from week to week instead of thinking about what youâll be doing in a year If you want a guy with a clear future plan then you should try going for some of those nice guys who are always asking you out at work   Thereâs a difference between being a bad boy and being abusive If the guy youâre with is either abusive to you verbally or physically then itâs time to remove yourself from the situation ASAP No guy is worth the pain and suffering youâll have to face from abuse even if he keeps promising that every time is the last and that heâll change his ways Bad boys can be fun to date as long as they donât pose any harm to your wellbeing   If youâre being abused talk to a close friend or family member and create a plan for leaving the situation as quickly and as safely as possible   If you want to enjoy your time with the bad boy then you canât let him dictate every little thing you should do together Though you may think he wants to be completely in control you should give him a run for his money and show that you have ideas for where you should eat and where you should go over the weekend Make sure youâre both equally in control and donât let him tell you how to act dress or look heâll like you much more if you stand up for yourself and prove yourself to be independent   Most bad boys if theyâre the harmless kind like a girl with her own initiate and donât actually want to be in control all the time   If you want your relationship with the bad boy to last then you canât put pressure on him to move in with you meet all of your friends and family members or marry you any time soon Bad boys like to run free and to do their own thing and as soon as you put the pressure on heâll start to back off Though itâs natural to want the relationship to move forward you should know that youâre dealing with a bad boy and that he may be allergic to commitment   Let him move at his own pace If he wants to meet your friends or family members then heâll ask to do it You can casually mention meeting up with them to see if he wants to come but you should avoid telling him that your friends or family members are dying to meet him or heâll feel suffocated Donât compare the progression of your relationship to the progression of other relationships either Just because your best friend and your neighbor both got engaged this month doesnât mean that you two should do the same   If you want to make it work with the bad boy then you canât keep tabs on him 247 to make sure heâs been loyal to you Youâve got to trust him to do his own thing because he has an independent spirit If you text him every half hour pop in on him unannounced or just act insecure when he talks to other women then heâll quickly get tired of your routine and will look for a woman who doesnât want to keep him on a tight leash   Of course if heâs really flirtatious with other girls then thatâs something you should have a talk about If heâs just having harmless interactions with girls and youâre on his case then his alarm bells will go off You have to be able to trust a man in every relationship If heâs legitimately suspiciously gone for hours then you can ask him where he went but if you freak out every time it takes him fifteen minutes to return your call youâll be creating a fuss   Though you may think that you only want a bad boy in your life in the end you should know that there is a wealth of nice guys at your work or near your home that would love to get to know you If youâre looking for a level of commitment a bad boy wonât give you then you may have to look elsewhere to really get what you want Instead of being skeptical of guys who actually want to get to know you without a chase give the next guy a chance and see what happens You may be pleasantly surprisedAsk yourself what youâre so afraid of when it comes to nice guys Do you think theyâll all be too boring too sincere too serious Give one of them a chance and you may see that your expectations will change
If your crush hasnât already asked you to dance it may be time to take matters into your own hands If you are sitting and talking to your crush wait until a song comes on that you want to dance to before asking them For example you may wait for a slow song or a song that has a good rhythmIf you are already dancing you may not have as big of a window to ask them to dance since your conversation may be shorter If you absolutely hate the song playing or you feel like itâs too fast to dance to with your crush try to keep the conversation going until the next song comes on   When a song comes on you like ask your crush âDo you want to danceâ Keep the tone of your voice light and casual and make sure to smile as you ask themAlways ask even if you are dancing near each other Unless your crush starts dancing close to you donât go up and start dancing in front of or against them Asking them is cute and polite whereas starting to dance up in their space can be pushy and creepyIf youâre a girl donât let societyâs norms stop you from asking your crush to dance Thereâs a good chance that they will say yes and be flattered that you asked   Many people get nervous about dancing so your crush may be hesitant to dance even if they like you If they say something like Im not really good at dancing offer to teach them some moves that are easy to follow Even showing them overthetop moves like the sprinkler is a good way to be goofy and get them comfortable Your crush will feel less pressure if they know that you arent expecting them to look suave or cool   School dances often play songs that have specific steps If your crush doesnt want to dance to regular songs wait until one comes on like the electric slide that follows a routine and offer to show them how to dance to it If you dont know any specific moves or dance steps you can also just say Its ok Im a terrible dancer so I wont judge This is a good way of making your crush feel more at ease and willing to dance   If your crush says yes start dancing with them However donât get too close If you are slow dancing keep about a foot between yourselves If you are dancing to a fast song still try to keep some space between you two Try to see if your crush is enjoying the dance and wants to get closer For instance your crush could close some of the distance between the two of you or if you are slow dancing they could wrap their arms to hold you closer They also may look you in the eye and smile which would be a good indication that they want to get closer Youâve been dancing at a respectful distance However you may see that your crush is enjoying the dance and seems like they would be comfortable getting closer If you are slow dancing hold them a little closer to you If you are dancing to a fast song move and inch or two nearer to them Once the song ends see if your crush wants to dance for another song If they stay close to you or start dancing as soon as the new song comes on it means that they would like to keep dancing If they move away or give you a hug it could mean that they enjoyed the dance but they want to take a breakYou can always ask âDo you want to keep dancingâ if youâre not sure how they are feeling

Dont pretend to be jerk so that you can impress her Both lying about your true self and being rude will put distance between you and the girl   However dont be afraid to tease her a bit Once youve talked a few times most girls will be comfortable with you making a few lighthearted jokes at her expense as long as its a two way street and she can do the same to you It shows that youre confident enough in yourself to make a small gamble that she could be offended If she takes a joke seriously and is offended just apologize calmly and let her know you were only kidding  First ask yourself why you want to impress this girl Is it because she is the most popular girl in school or because you truly enjoy her company   Hang out near her and listen to what the girl and her friends are saying Dont make it a dead giveaway that youre listening Then approach them and say I couldnt help over hearing BLAH BLAH BLAH It should go naturally if not then perhaps you should rethink this girl Chemistry matters   Beautiful girls dont look around and see faces as attractive as their own  they see YOUR face and others like it But they DO appreciate someone who makes them laugh Be optimistic and cheerful   Youve seen people walk around with their heads hanging shuffling their feet as they walk They look beaten unhappy defeated That isnt attractive to anyone If you want to attract a woman whos out of your league then show her youre confident Hold your head up walk like youre proud to be you delighted with who you are  but not arrogant maintain eye contact if talking to her Watch how others walk and carry themselves and try to mimic the confident behaviors you see   Dont wait for her to break the conversation off the first few times Keep conversations short interesting and active and then go away Let her know you have to go she doesnt need to know why wish her a good day and walk away   Find out what other qualities she has that make her an outstanding woman Ask her about herself and who she is Women who are used to being noticed for their outer appearance wont be swayed easily by comments on their physical appearance Be different and find the inner beauty you can still admire the outer beauty in your own thoughts   Did she do an awesome job on her speech in history Let her know and be genuine Highlight some parts that you enjoyed or tell her about an article you read on the topic   Sometimes you meet and upon spending a little time with a girl realize you have very strong feelings for her that you wont be able to hide Dont Just keep it light and start hitting on her immediately If you make a little joke of it and say things like Shes crazy about me or Of course Im staring at you youre the girl of my dreams wiggles eyebrows up and down suggestively with a big cheesy smile for herto her friends while shes standing right there it will just be part of the way you get along very early on But careful if she doesnt giggle or seem amused and a little bit flattered this will not work and will become tiresome very quickly Watch for her reaction and adjust   Ask her out on a friendly date so you can see how much you guys really have in common And if she is conceited then you will be grateful you didnt ask her out on a real date   Be very cautious to only do the friendly date once or twice If you do it too much shell start to look at your relationship as friendship and this can be a difficult perception to reverse
If youre a photographer keep all the necessary lens cords and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio Paints should be kept with brushes cleaner and canvas print supplies should be by the ink etc Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier limiting your search to a much smaller area Some ideas include   Essential supplies area  the things you use every day Inspiration and reference area Dedicated work area  Infrequent or secondary supplies area tucked out of the way  This doesnt mean cleaning the entire studio it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk easel pottery wheel etc clean each night Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately without having to do any work or tidying   Even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art   As visual people a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight By using jars old glasses vases and cheap clear plastic drawers you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly Some ideas beyond those just mentioned include   Canvas shoe racks on the back of the door Wine racks with cups in each slot to hold penspencils Plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint pigment etc Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you dont want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape Cheap and easy this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration Shelving is an artists best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space Dont be afraid to get up high either especially for infrequently used supplies The upper reaches of the room are often the most underutilized but provide vital space for all your tools and materials Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas sketches and planning without requiring extra equipment or space You can even use it for smaller areas Paint over jars or storage equipment allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change   A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently This usually has the opposite effect leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things you can just follow the labels freeing your mind to think about art Once a month do a purge of your studio If it isnt essential or part of a project either throw it out or file it away for later Artists are constantly making new things experimenting and making a mess This is a good thing but only if you set aside time to declutter It may not be fun at the moment but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch   Dont be sentimental here If you havent used it in the last six months there is little chance youll use it in the next six months Toss it
If theres only one thing you do to boost your confidence make it this Try not to fall for the trap of changing your normal behavior to impress your crush This is a bad idea for a few reasons First it puts pressure on you to be someone youre not which can add to your stresses because its not something youre used to Second it gives your crush a false idea of who you are This can lead to confusion and hurt feelings when you drop the act On the other hand if youre true to yourself you dont have to worry about keeping any lies straight   This basic idea can extend to things as simple as casual conversations For example if your crush says that they love the movie Fight Club and you havent seen it dont say Me too to try to impress This is setting yourself up for embarrassment if for instance your crush asks what your favorite part is  In the grand scheme of things looks are only a single fairly shallow part of what makes someone attracted to someone else However putting a little extra effort into your looks can be very useful if it helps you keep your confidence high Consider spending a little extra time each morning putting yourself together if you know your crush is going to be around Loving the way that you look in the mirror will help you feel positive about yourself later in the day   However youll never want to spend too much time worrying about the way you look Remember that your crush is most likely to like you for your personality not the way you look Stressing out about whether or not you look perfect will only lower your confidence and make it harder for you to act natural when youre around your crush   The way you carry yourself can have a big effect on how confident you look â and feel While sitting or walking keep your shoulders back your head slightly raised and your chest slightly stuck out Above all wear a classy smile People are generally much more likely to start conversation with people who appear friendly and open   On the other hand nervous behaviors can make you look and feel less confident Try to avoid fiddling with your hair biting your nails and similar gestures   When youre absolutely infatuated with someone its easy to forget that theyre an ordinary person In addition to the things that make them amazing crushes have flaws fears and insecurities just like you do They are complex imperfect people so dont think of them like movie stars or royalty Instead try to think of them the same way youd think of any casual acquaintance   This is especially important if you eventually start a relationship with this person Sooner or later if you spend enough time together you will find things about each other that you dont like This can be a very unpleasant realization if you have the idea that your significant other is perfect   Scrutinizing every single action that you make around your crush or that your crash makes around you is a sure fire way to turn yourself into a nervous wreck Odds are that you dont always choose the perfect thing to say or do when youre around your friends and family so theres no reason to worry about this when youre with your crush Ironically stressing out about every single thing that happens just makes it more likely that youll make a mistake so stay cool   If during a conversation you find yourself thinking Oh my gosh why did I just say that relax Most minor mistakes will go completely unnoticed If they dont your crush may even find them amusing Most people wont get offended or angry over a minor slipup Besides if they do they arent good crush material
The best way to show that you donât like her as more than a friend is by acting like it isnât happening If you just act normal while sheâs making her feelings obvious she will probably eventually realize why Exhaust all other options before you tell a girl directly that you arenât interested in her Since she has feelings for you she will most likely be hurt and embarrassed if you reject her so harshly Keep your conversations with her relatively brief and donât deviate too much from small talk If this doesnât do the trick try hinting in one or more of the following ways to insinuate that you arenât interested in a more subtle way   Be unreceptive when she tries to make plans to meet up in the future Tell her that youâre in a relationship with someone else Tell her youâre really busy and donât have time for a relationship right now She will probably make small movements and position her body in a way that is welcoming To show that you donât feel the way she does counter her movements If she sits a little too close to you scoot away from her a little bitAlso consider crossing your arms sometimes when she approaches you This is a natural sign of resistance If youâve tried to be clear in other ways and sheâs still being forward itâs probably time to be direct Remember to speak to her the way youâd like to be spoken to if you were in her position Try using âIâ statements to keep the conversation more about you Listing reasons why you donât like her is rude and will damage her confidence so donât do that Instead try saying one of these statements   âIâm really sorry but I donât see you that wayâ âI think youâre great but Iâm looking for something else right nowâ âIâve enjoyed talking with you but Iâm not really feeling a romantic connection between usâ Since you donât like her more than a friend keep your texts friendly but short and relatively infrequent Texting her too much can give her the wrong idea which could get her hopes up and make her feel more disappointed later on
When you finish a project whether it sells or not dont just stuff it away in a drawer You never know when youll want to revisit and idea or more excitingly when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects   If you do electronic work back it up every 36 months on a dedicated hard drive There is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects More than many industries successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists curators instructors and gallery assistants to be successful You never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand or when youll have some work you want to place in a friends art show Dont leave meetings and connections up to chance  organize and compile your contact information in once place for later Make notes of   Phone number Email Location Role in the art world How you met or connected If youre looking to make a living off art you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business This however does not need to interfere with your creative process Simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy   You can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes as they are private business expenses Keeping expenses organized isnt just about time it is about saving money If youre making the same or similar pieces each day you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made So if 10 wood sculptures cost you 100 each sculpture cost you 10 to make 10010  10 This may seem trivial but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work   At the very least ensure that you are not losing money on each piece   If you want an organized productive artistic practice you need to know about the trends around your work Keeping organized is about more than just your own studio it is about understanding the art market youre a part of Peruse Etsy visit galleries and show openings and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices   While it doesnt have a dollar value make sure you value your time as well as your materials In the earlier example dont forget that it cost more than just 10 to make the sculpture Your hours of work and experience are essential too so dont sell the piece for 20 if it took you a week to make While pricing your work is difficult dont balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for  not everyone can do what you do and people are paying for your talent and experience   At the very least consider what youd be paid if you used your time otherwise Twenty hours spent painting could be worth 15 an hour at another job You should consider this missed money when pricing work If you want to make art your living you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself Careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off
Before you saddle your horse you need to tie her so that she stays put Check out this helpful wikiHow article to learn how to tie proper knots to keep a horse secured crossties are preferred but not a must   If you tie your horse with the lead rope its always a safe idea to use a quickrelease or âslipâ knot Consider slipping the tail of the lead rope through the quick release knotâs loop if your horse is knowledgeable about untying knots  Horses can become very irritated and sore when ridden without being groomed properly for both your safety and the horseâs you should never skip this step   Brush your horseâs body Use a curry comb to remove any caked mud and then a stiff brush to remove the dust and hair brought up by the curry comb Finish with a soft brush Pay special attention to the horseâs back belly and girth area Dirt or burrs underneath tack can irritate your horse to the point of misbehaving and even bucking Remove tangles and burrs with a mane and tail comb Be careful when brushing the tail horses can and will kick Clean the horses hooves and check for lodged stones Be careful or you may be kicked you should not do this alone unless you are experienced   Dont place a saddle over a wound   Check the horse for lumps bumps swelling sores and heat that could mean your horse is unsound and unfit for riding   Your horse needs this to protect its back and keep the saddle in place Place the saddle pad or blanket on the horseâs back   Put the pad a bit higher on the withers then sliding it back into place just behind the mane This ensures that the hair on the horseâs back lies flat beneath the pad and saddle Make sure the blanket or pad is even on both sides   At this point you will place a saddle depending on whether you ride Western or English style This will likely be determined by your training or by what tack is available  A Western style saddle is designed for utility since it was designed for a cowboy or rancher to use on the job It has a saddle horn and a high back making it a more comfortable seat for long hours on horsebackAn English style saddle is sleek and small with no saddle horn and a low back It is best for formal riding and show riding Stand on the left side of the horse and flip the rightside cinches and stirrup over the seat of the saddle to keep them from getting caught beneath it Then swing the saddle over the horse Rock the saddle back and forth into position and unfold the cinches and stirrup   Dont do this if youre working a young or unknown horse it hurts to be hit in the head by a heavy stirrup if the horse acts up   Line up the center line with the spine of the horse   Check that the stirrups hang equally on both sides make sure that the front of the saddle sits just behind the withers and not on top of the shoulder blades   You should be able to slide two fingers under the gullet the curve of the saddle just under the horn without cramping and have 34 fingerswidth of space between the horseâs forearms and the cinch   Donât use a saddle if it doesnât fit properly An illfitting saddle can cause a horse to bolt or buck and also can make a horse sore and cause bad habits   This is a key step you wonât be riding without a cinch However keep in mind that you should always cinch up a cinch gradually you donât want your horse to become cinchsour   Pull the cinch under the horseâs belly towards you and slip the latigo strap down through the cinch buckle Pull it all the way through and make sure neither the cinch nor the latigo strap are twisted Lift the latigo and slip it through the saddleâs Dring from outsidein and leaving the ring angled towards the left Make the cinch snug but not overly so Repeat the process once or twice more if you have a lot of length left in the latigo strap Straighten the secured part of the strap so each layer is on top of the one beneath it then gradually pull down on the tail of the latigo to tighten the cinch Donât tighten it all the way thatâll come later Move the tail of the latigo horizontally across the secured latigo and bringing it up through the saddleâs Dring again but from the right side Now slip the tail down through the loop created and fasten the knot This can be confusing best to have an experienced saddler help you Walk the horse around for a minute or two This will let the horse relax to the saddle and stop bloating a strategy many tricky horses will use to keep you from putting the saddle on too tight Finish tightening the cinch Do this pulling the top layer of latigo strap not the tail upwards Keep the tightening a gradual process donât rush things Retighten the knot Done   There should be two fingerswidth of space between the horseâs belly and the bottom of the cinch   This process is similar to that of securing the front cinch but instead of ending the process with a knot youâll use the buckle   This ensures the skin under the cinch isnât wrinkled to keep the horse from being pinched while riding   You can also gradually stretch each front leg forward for a few seconds this also works to reduce tension in the horses skin   Do this by latching it to the saddleâs cinch and front Drings   This will keep the saddle from slipping backwards and is especially helpful for on the trail   With your saddle in place you are ready to mount from the left side of course Thats a fancy way to say you need to move the stirrup up higher and secure it in place so that it will not dangle down in your way you do this by sliding the metal foot stirrup up and tucking it under the saddle   This keeps the stirrups out of the way so that they wonât hit the horse as you lift the saddle over the horseâs back   You will put it back on in a moment but taking it off keeps it from dangling while you try to position the saddle   Alternately you can fold it over the top of the saddle leaving it attached on the righthand side   If you are using a contoured pad a common English style which is shaped like the outline of a saddle there should be about an inch of pad all the way around For a square pad be sure to leave at least one inch around the front edge of the saddle   The saddle should not be so far forward that in makes the shoulder movement hard   Stand on the lefthand side of the horse place the saddle on the pad on the horses back with the pommel of the saddle just in front of the horses withers   The arch of the pommel should be directly over the highest point of the horses withers The saddle will nestle in behind the horses shoulderblades   Now that the saddle is in place you need to replace the girth so that you can tighten the saddle and secure it in place Attach the girth to the girth billets on the off side the horses right then bring it up to the near side the horses left   As a guideline the girth should come under the horse just behind its front legs If you can see a gap between the elbow and the girth the saddle is too far back Fasten the girth securely You should be able to get your hand between horse and girth but it should be a snug fit   Now youre ready to mount
In the modern age we have the latest technology right at our fingertips â use it Send the girl youâre interested in a text message How she responds will often show you how interested she is in youTake note and learn how far interest into you really goes   If shes short with you that may be a sign shes busy or simply doesnt have the time to talk via text Use this as an opportunity to set up a time to talk face to face If she mirrors your texting style shes definitely interested Note how often she uses words from your vocabulary If she does she admires them and is very interested in the person using them If she asks you questions shes also definitely interested After all shes taking time to get to know you and gather information about you Be as open and honest as possible to give her a good idea of who you are and what youre like Bear in mind technology does not always move as fast as we would like it to If she doesnât immediately respond she may be in a âdead zoneâ without reception and has yet to get your message She may also be in a situation like work or school where texting is not an option Focus on the response rather than the time it takes to get one   The amount of social media available itâs difficult to not find avenues to get in touch with people See if the girl youâre interested in has a social media account on Facebook Twitter Instagram or Tumblr and get in touch that way   The barriers social media offer can sometimes make people feel comfortable enough to talk to one another even if theyâve just met each other If youâre too shy for conversation â or feel she might be â social media can offer interaction without having to come face to face Maybe the girl youâre interested in needs that buffer to feel completely comfortable and show her interest   If you and the girl youâre interested in share friends or coworkers asking them about her may be a good route to take albeit somewhat indirect Thereâs an off chance sheâs mentioned you to one of them or is more willing to discuss the issue with one of them instead of directly with you
Running can scare the horses and is dangerous for you too a you can easily slip Walk or power walk if the horses are calm  Yellingshouting can scare the horses Use a calm quiet voice at all times   This is thought of as threatening Look just below or around the shoulder   Go calmly towards their shoulder   Spooked horses can often panic and hurt themselves   These can spook even the most quiet of horses   No splashing water at your friends or galloping around the yard Save this for the park   If they are tied up tacked up etc this can be quite dangerous   This causes them to drop Open them them like everyone else   Smoking is prohibited in all yards for obvious reasons One cigarette in the straw and you have a barn fire on your hands   They may be trying something difficult and not only may you throw their concentration you could also spook their horse
If you think you might run into your crush take a few extra minutes to brush your hair an extra bit or maybe put on one of your favorite tops Donât go overboard but a little extra primping may give you that extra bit of poise to counteract any klutzinessFor example you could style your hair in a way that makes you feel the most confident such as a sophisticated updo Or you could give yourself a home manicure or pedicure every other week Other people will also notice that you look put together and they will be less likely to pick on you or bother you as a result Your confidence will make them view any mishaps on your part as simply accidents and nothing more   Keep a slight smile on your face even if the going gets tough This will show others that you are not that affected by any klutzy behavior and that youâve moved on so they should too Smiling also relaxes your body reduces stress and makes other people feel more comfortable with youIf you are not sure how your smile looks you might want to practice a bit in front of a mirror You will soon find that it comes naturally to you when you feel good   The best way to demonstrate that you do control your body is to carry yourself in the best possible way Keep your back straight and pay attention to holding your shoulders back as you walk Focus on taking clear deep breaths as well A benefit of maintaining proper posture is that it will also help to minimize any clumsiness in the futureAs you walk over to meet your crush and other friends imagine balancing a book on your head Each step that you take must be slow and chosen carefully This will make you less likely to trip or fall   If you are unsure whether or not you can talk to your crush without stumbling try to interact with his friends instead Ask them about their hobbies or interests Talk to them about the dayâs events Just be casual and discuss anything that comes to mind This can help you build up to interacting with your crush directlyYou might say âDid you all go to the football game on Fridayâ Or âWhat do you guys have planned for Spring Breakâ   As soon as you fall you may feel the need to stand up and say âIâm sorryâ to everyone who witnessed it Unless you hurt or knocked someone else down this isnât really necessary Stating an apology could make you feel better but it will likely make you feel worse and even less worthy of being around your crush So just skip it entirely

You may have trouble understanding or accepting that your ex seems okay after the breakup if the breakup was difficult for you You may want to know that they are as miserable as you are Instead you can deal with your ex a lot better and handle interactions with them if you accept the fact that they seem fine with the breakup   If someone tells you that your ex is doing okay or if you see your ex and they seem okay then just be happy for them For example if a friend says âAshley seems cool after the breakupâ you could say âOkay thatâs good That makes me happyâ Unless you are prepared to hear that they are happy without you avoid asking your ex if they are really doing okay or happy since the breakup You might not like their response Keep in mind that just because your ex seems fine doesnât mean thatâs necessarily the case Your ex may just be acting that way so you donât know how upset they are  You can deal with an ex who seems fine after your breakup by keeping your distanceYou donât have to avoid them like the plague but do make sure that you arenât going out of your way to interact with them   Avoid trolling their social networking profiles looking for new posts and pictures For instance you should resist checking their Facebook profile daily to see if their relationship status has changed Donât call text or message your ex unless you have a legitimate reason For example calling because you have a child together is a legitimate reason Calling because you saw your exâs favorite car isnât   Depending on the circumstances of the breakup you may have some built up anger or resentment toward your ex When you have interactions with your ex and they seem fine after the breakup you will be able to handle it if you remain respectful You should also be respectful when you are talking to other people about your ex   Avoid yelling scream crying or making a scene when you are interacting with your ex For example donât walk up to them and start calling them names Talk to your ex in a calm confident way when you interact For instance you might calmly say âHiâ when you see your ex out in public Avoid gossiping or badmouthing your ex Try to say something positive or at least neutral about your ex For example you might say âOh okâ if someone tells you that your ex is doing fine
Having a stable relationship with an animal makes them so much easier to train If your guinea pig doesnt trust you or thinks of you as a scary giant that comes to try and communicate all of the time it will be more difficult to teach The trust of an animal is a very fragile thing   Think of it as if you are a mountain climber trying to climb the mountain of training The peak is success and the rope that you depend on to get you to the top is the relationship with the animal you wish to train Would you rather have a weak rope  aka a weak relationship  or a stronger more dependable one If you choose the weak rope and it snaps youll come tumbling back down to where you started The strong rope has a better chance of holding up though be aware that if you are constantly tampering with the rope even the strongest has a chance of breaking If you arent sure of your current relationship with your pet it is best to keep working with them until they trust you enough to allow you to pick them up and pet them This may take longer with skittish piggies but never give up  Once your piggy is willing to trust you and do what you say its time to start looking into the many methods of training Guinea pigs are very fragile and their brains work a bit differently from a dogs so every training method will need to be tweaked before use with a guinea pig   Clicker training and verbal markers are a few ways to train your guinea pig Clicker training is slightly easier than using a verbal marker and requires a clicker while using a verbal marker is more difficult and can have different results than what is expected   Some owners have different needs than others and some animals need a specific type of training As mentioned before any training method chosen will need to be tweaked in many different ways to suit a guinea pig rather than a dog   Different methods require different materials Some may need to be purchased while others can just be found around the house Training a guinea pig is not as expensive as training a dog per se but cost is made up in effort   If you choose to clicker train your guinea pig you will need a soft clickerbe sure that it is not too loud or sharp for a guinea pigs earsand of course treats Treats that have worked well for many guinea pig owners include chopped up carrots celery with veins removed and lettuce torn up into little pieces Whatever the reward may be always make sure that it is quick chewable and guinea pigsafe
This is the first and most important step It doesnt matter if she is younger than you before you ever engage in a relationship you need to get a better understanding of each other For most girls a good conversation is a turnon and may open her eyes to you Ask questions about her her family what she likes to do etc This could also help decide if she is the girl for you or if maybe you dont like her as much as you thought you did If you have your eyes set on a girl in her young teens remember how young she is Maybe not ready for the kind of relationship that you are ready for at whatever age you are So you may have to wait or dismiss the idea that you will ever go out  Shell be able to tell if youre constantly mentioning it which will make you seem less genuine and truthful   Resist the urge to just ask her out Real relationships take time and effort to build Besides randomly asking her out will confuse her and increase your chances of being turned down   Ask her how shes doing today Dont ignore her in front of your friends just because she is younger Show your interest first in a platonic sense This will let her know that you care first as a friend and then later as something more A really good idea is to invite her along and get her to feel included   But only when you feel like your relationship has progressed to that point Subtle romantic gestures are cute such as random flowers Use your knowledge of her to think of specific ideas that will make her swoon Perhaps wait until she starts to flirt with you   Maybe she doesnt want to date you Maybe she isnt ready Above all you must remember that a relationship takes two people Dont pressure her into anything she doesnt want to do   Any skill worth having is worth developing and like anything this is a skill that takes time If at first you dont succeed keep trying with someone else Theres plenty of fish in the sea and the best fishermen dont fish for the fish itself they fish just for the experience of fishing Try catchandrelease for a while until you get comfortable You can learn what to do with your catch later
Giving up on something you want can be frightening but actually doing so can be a relief Unconsciously youve been motivated to pursue himâhes been your goalMake a conscious decision to no longer pursue him It may help to write this down to tell a friend or even to hold a small ceremony for yourself   Consider gathering things you have that make you think of him and putting them in a box throwing them away or giving them away Once your private space is cleared of reminders consider holding a small cleansing ceremony Burn some sage incense and walk through your room or your homeWhen a wish for him comes up dont suppress it and dont cling to it Acknowledge how you feel but remind yourself that you are choosing to move on  Dont push away feelings of sadness when they come Its totally natural and healthy to be sad when you have feelings for someone and it doesnt work out Take a week or a few weeks to grieve Cry if you can if your feelings are hurt you are actually hurt and you will do better to acknowledge it Crying can be extremely therapeuticListen to music that lets you feel your feelings Exercise It helps to clear your mind and you will be healthier Write in a diary if you have one Write a letter to him if you want Keep it for a week or two before you give it to him or dont give it to him at all The point is to get your feelings out Go on some long walks by yourself Youll have time to think and youll feel better for the exercise Know when to stop If youre dropping the people and projects that matter to you youre grieving too much Consult a therapist if you cant get back into your normal life Did he lead you on acting like he liked you for attention Did you pursue him relentlessly even after he let you know that it wasnt going to work Was everyone honest and considerate or was bad behavior involved If you feel like you misbehaved apologize   If you feel like he did something wrong and youre friends consider letting him know that you feel hurt You can write a brief letter or email if its too painful to talk to him in person If you arent friends it might feel better to not communicate Ask yourself what would feel better and follow that path   Maybe he was totally unadventurous or maybe he was too much of a risk taker Maybe he constantly interrupted you Maybe you were in love with the fantasy of this guy and not the guy himself It can be hard to see the real person when youre infatuated   You dont have to demonize him of course Just take your image of him with a grain of salt Remember he was never perfect you just had some perfect feelings about him   You were your own unique and interesting person long before this guyâs opinion ever meant a thing to you the more you remember and act on that the stronger and more attractive youâll feel Realize that just because he doesnt like you doesnt necessarily have anything to do with you It could be just his problem Attraction between two people is influenced by factors of timing of nature of nurture and of factors beyond our controlOne persons feelings about you are not a way to measure your character   Make a list of things you like about yourself Include big things and small things Group accomplishments personality traits and talents Make a list of what you really care for in a relationship and see if he fulfilled those expectations He probably wont and thats okay Ask yourself what can you count on yourself to do What difficulties have you overcome   Now is a great time to make a change Redecorate your house or just move the furniture around in your roomPursue a new hobby sign up for some volunteer hours get a different haircut Master a new skill take a class cook a new dish or make yourself something youve been wanting like shelf If you have some extra cash buy a new outfitAsk friends to do things with you but also try things that will get you out of your comfort zone Talking to new people will be restorative   Feeling bad about yourself after a crush doesnt work out is normal but its not a great way to feel Taking care of yourself is a way to show yourself that you do matter and it will also make you feel a lot betterGet regular exercise meals and sleep Get therapy if you are feeling depressed or anxious   Stick to a healthy routine every day Clean up and dress yourself nicely even when you feel like sludgeâit will make you feel better   If you think you tend to like a certain kind of guy try dating someone different you might be making your romantic choices based on a pattern that doesnt actually work for you If you always like boisterous overachievers give a quiet introvert a chance   Remember that there is always someone for you You will find a guy who adores you soon enough Donât rush to rebound or you might end up breaking someone elses heart It will hurt you and it could hurt them Its okay to get out and flirt Dont get seriously involved with someone right away but do flirt a little or even go on casual dates if thats fun for you   Once youve let go of hoping for someone you just need time to pass The more time passes the better youll feel Meanwhile limit your exposure to him Dont hang out and try not to bump into him too much This doesnt mean you should hide outâabsolutely notâjust that you should avoid interacting while youre still in pain   Bring a friend when you know youll run into him We cant always avoid people who likeâif you know youll have to be around him sometimes bring friends who know whats going on with you to back you up Keep it positive You dont have to glare at him or treat him rudely When you feel normal again you might end up being real friends with this guy Just be polite and try to avoid him discretely   Of course you may need some alone time at first but turning into a fulltime hermit is just going to make you feel like heâs the only person in the world Go out with your pals have a buddy night and socialize as much as feels good The more you meet your emotional needs elsewhere the less impact his absence will have on you   If hes a good friend and all your friends are mutual try organizing smaller outingsâjust two or three at a timeâso that his absence doesnt feel conspicuous   Keeping heartbreak private can make it hurt more It can be a relief to tell your nearest and dearest what youre going throughYou dont have to tell everyone and its probably better if you dontâbut if you have a few good friends and relatives who can keep your business private it might help to let them know that youre going through an emotionally rocky moment   Be sure to tell them if what youre saying is private Ask them not to treat the guy you had a crush on any differentlyâunless he was a jerk of course   If people talk they talk If unsubstantiated rumors are flying around know that theyll die down soon Dont add fuel to the rumors by getting angry or defensive Instead when confronted by nosy people say it is your personal life raise your eyebrows and change the subjectWhatever you say wonÂt change their minds just always be the bigger person smile and be polite
Before you do anything you should talk to your vet about the individual needs of your guinea pig This way youâll have all of the information you need to make sure your guinea pig will stay happy and healthy before you embark on the journey of making your own guinea pig food Consider   Your guinea pig might have specific nutritional needs due to preexisting conditions Your vet might be able to provide you with a detailed list of vegetables andor pellets to include in your mix Your guinea pig might have specific nutritional needs due to age size or breed  Your guinea pig should have a number of vegetables in his or her food This is important because different foods provide different vitamins and nutrition The more diverse your food offering the better your guinea pigâs nutrition will be In addition the more diverse the food the happier your guinea pig may be with his or her meal Think about   Kale and other leafy greens like spinach chard or parsley Leafy greens should make up the majority of your vegetable mix Peas Carrots Use carrots and other highsugar foods in limited amounts Cucumbers Celery Corn Sweet peppers Avoid spicy peppers There is no rule about how much guinea pig food you should prepare at one time However depending on the age and weight of your friend as well as how many guinea pigs you have you should probably adjust the amount you prepare accordingly   Prepare your vegetables making sure you will have one cup of fresh vegetables per guinea pig per day Make sure that that the majority of your mix is made up of leafy greens In order to keep your food fresh only make what your friend will consume in a week After preparing you can store the food in your refrigerator for the duration of the week But remember to consider freshness as the week progresses Some vegetables will store better than others and some might be fresher than others If your food starts to turn toss it and prepare some more If you have several guinea pigs make sure you make enough for all of them at one time If youâre using vegetables that tend to turn quick consider preparing your food twice a week instead of once a week   After youâve gathered your vegetables prepare them for your little friend Make sure to wash the vegetables and then cut them into small pieces for your guinea pig to eat Cutting them will make it a lot easier for your friend to eat them and will also prevent spoilage as youâll be able to put the exact amount that your pig will eat   Wash vegetables thoroughly and make sure any chemicals soap and dirt is washed off Slice your vegetables into very small bitesized pieces The size will vary depending on the vegetable If possible slice carrots and cucumbers into 18th of an inch pieces or even smaller Leafy greens should be chopped finely too Look at your vegetables to make sure there arenât pieces that are too big Make sure to take out any pieces your friend will have a hard time moving or eating Now that youâve cut your vegetables you need to mix them together Mixing thoroughly is important because you want to make sure that your little friendâs food formula is diverse and varied If you give your guinea pig food that is mostly one vegetable or another he or she wonât get proper vitamins and nutrition   Dump your vegetable pieces into a tupperware Put the lid on the tupperware Shake the tupperware vigorously until the vegetables are well mixed   After youâve mixed your vegetables you need to add guinea pig pellets to your food mix Pellets are extremely important because they are formulated to maintain guinea pig health and provide vitamins that guinea pigs need and may not be present in their normal vegetablebased diet   Make sure to get pellets formulated with vitamin C Try to find pellets that are dye free Add in 18th of a cup of pellets per day per adult guinea pig to your vegetable mix Younger guinea pigs or pregnant guinea pigs may require more â consult your vet Use alfalfa pellets for young growing and pregnant guinea pigs under 6 months Use a timothy haybased based pellet for adults over 6 months This pellet will be formulated with Vitamin C Mix the pellets in just like you mixed the vegetables After youve mixed your guinea pig food it will be time to feed your friend Feeding your friend is fairly easy but you want to follow a few guidelines when doing so   Provide your friend with 1 18 cup of the vegetablepellet mix in a food bowl at the same time every day The best time might be the morning Most guinea pigs will eat their food throughout the day and night However if you have a little friend who tends to gorge make sure to divide feedings up throughout the day Make sure to monitor the food over the course of the day Remove any spoiled or uneaten food at the end of the day or the following morning   In addition to food guinea pigs need plenty of fresh water to keep them healthy and active Because of this you need to closely monitor your friendâs water supply so that he or she always has water   Buy a water bottle with a metal spout so that your friend can drink water without making much of a mess Guinea pigs drink between 100 to 200 ml of water per kilogram of bodyweight per day If your friend drinks more or less water than he or she should contact your vet You need to provide your guinea pig with an unlimited supply of hay in addition to your formulated food This is because guinea pig digestive systems need a lot of fiber to make sure they are healthy and regular In addition by providing your guinea pig with a lot of hay you will give him or her something to chew on which will promote good dental health   Try to buy secondcut hay This hay is tenderer than first batch hay Make sure to clean out your friendâs hay and replace it with fresh hay every week or two Always make sure there is enough hay for your friend to eat and chew on Make sure the hay you purchase is intended for consumption and is not treated with any chemicals There are a number of foods you will want to avoid when formulating your guinea pig food or feeding him or her treats Some foods are extremely dangerous to guinea pigs and are poisonous and toxic If you feed them to your friend he or she could die or at the very least become seriously ill Make sure to avoid   Iceberg lettuce or cabbage Iceberg lettuce and cabbage have minimal nutritional value and can give your friend diarrhea Potato peelings Potato peelings can be toxic if theyâve begun to turn green Rhubarb Rhubarb leaves are poisonous Meat and dairy Guinea pigsâ digestive tracts do not process meat or dairy very well Any food not intended or designed for guinea pigs

Support them like a friend should This is an attractive quality because it shows how much you care and how much you can add to their life Listen to them rant about that teacher you both hate watch one of their games or surprise them by dropping in on their concerts Say Hi to your crush as you pass by them If they arent feeling well or are upset about something help them out and comfort them as best as you can   You dont need to spend time alone with them but you do need to spend time together You can hang out in groups and do things like watch movies or go to a great local music venue Just give them the opportunity to start to get to know you   Learn more about them and get to know them for who they really are rather than just the basic facts that anyone could tell you People like to feel a strong connection and that the person theyre with really understands them as a whole so if you know your crush well theyll be more likely to take your feelings seriously   You can get to know them by talking about things that are important to them like their hobbies their life goals their family and their beliefs   They should also get the chance to learn the same things about you Be open to discussion and inviting Dont try to compete with them when you discuss your life just let them see you for who you are   Find out what things you share in common in order to help build a lasting foundation for a relationship No matter how cute they are if you have absolutely nothing in common youre not going to have a very good time together Find out what theyre into and share your own interests with them   Relationships work best if both of you are geeky about the same thing And believe us everyone is geeky about something Even if that something is football   You dont necessarily have to enjoy what they are most passionate about but it will help a lot if you can understand and follow along with what they love Immerse yourself and give it time And especially ask them for help its a great bonding experience   People that are reluctant to get into relationships are usually reluctant because they worry about what that relationship will mean for their free time or who they are as a person Show your crush that they dont need to worry about that with you by letting them be their own person Dont be clingy Encourage them to go out and do things they enjoy And in the mean time show your independence by spending time on your own and with your own friends   Make sure your crush knows youre single and looking for someone to date Mention it offhand in a related conversation However you do it they need to know that you are in fact looking for someone to dateAsk them out for a movie or dinner   Tease them gently using a little bit of sarcasm or a wink and a nudge Be playful like poking them on the arm occasionally or punching them lightly on the arm or shoulder This will begin to show them that youre interested in them   Touching is a much more clear indicator of your feelings Give them a light touch on the shoulder or the arm always with a reason or excuse outofcontext touching can be creepy When youre a little closer try touching their hand too   Sometimes people just need things spelled out for them Tell your crush that you like them but dont put any pressure on them to respond They might need time to absorb the idea and examine their own feelings   You can skip the previous step in favor of going straight for this one or you can proceed to this one if they havent done anything to respond to your previous confession If youre a guy youre probably going to have to ask your girl out Girls shouldnt be afraid to take the lead though   Dont worry about rejection If they dont want to date you thats their loss and youre better off finding someone who really appreciates you
First impressions make a difference Good hygiene shows that you take care of yourself Take a shower every morning Wash your hair put on deodorant and possibly use a small amount of cologne or perfume Bad odors among other problems are distracting and cause people to not want to be around you   When you use cologne or perfume add only a small amount to your neck chest and shoulders She should be able to smell it up close without it overwhelming her senses  Clothes and hairstyle are also factors in how people judge you If your hair is long and greasy and you wear stained sweatpants chances are the girl will think of you in a negative way making her feel uncomfortable Buy yourself clothes that flatter your figure A style that looks unique on you without being too flashy will help her appreciate you   If you donât feel comfortable chances are she wonât feel comfortable either Anytime you seek her out display your best self This means going up to her maintaining eye contact and speaking loudly and clearly To do this practice being natural Look into a mirror as you speak maintaining eye contact with yourselfEven if you feel nervous around her slow down Breathe deeply speak slowly relax and focus on her Be your natural selfIf youâre going to be at the same place a girl is such as school or a party try getting to the place early This gives you time to get accustomed to the environment before it becomes more crowded and busy Avoid any bad habits that would make her uncomfortable such as swearing telling inappropriate jokes or fidgeting   Start with small questions such as âThatâs a nice tattoo what does it meanâ Avoid asking deep questions as these are too personal too soon Instead let her answer and then add to the conversation such as by talking about something a little personal such as your own tattoos Everyone has boundaries about how physically close someone cannot be Moving into this space too fast and being unwelcome is a sure way to make a girl feel uncomfortable Especially early on avoid standing too close putting your face near hers or touching sensitive areas such as the face Bad touches feel uncomfortable but welcome touches associate you with positive emotionsAs you get to know her better add positive touches such as putting a hand across her shoulder to shield her when moving through a crowd at a concert Other positive touches include touching her elbow when making a point or brushing her back and sides when laughing together   Once youâve established a base find ways to be near her This can be as simple as a shared activity such as lunch at school or you can do an activity that you both enjoy By talking to her find out her interests and spend time together building positive memorable experiences Try to go to different places and have different experiences as these stand out more than spending several hours watching TV at homeAn easy way to spend time together is if you belong to the same group Spending time with shared friends doing a school activity or doing a hobby together are all options that take some of the pressure off of you to be entertaining Even if youâre interested in her romantically donât suggest that she go on a date with you Youâre better served building up emotional comfort without revealing a motive as this shows you value her as an individual   There are many ways you can inadvertently end up making a judgment that makes her feel uncomfortable Try to avoid making jokes at the expense of her interests If sheâs quiet donât bring up her quietness or force her to be around people all the time Instead itâs better for you to be patient and funny in a way that shows you accept herInstead of saying âWow comic books are for nerdsâ or âWhy are you so quietâ talk to her about comic books or make commentary about the cafeteria food youâre eating This applies too to her goals in life If she wants to be a photographer encourage her no matter what you think of the choice   Be the kind of person that she can confide in This means not giving up her secrets She may start off by telling you something in confidence Donât talk behind her back and donât tell your friends Once she knows you wonât break her trust sheâll feel closer to you because sheâll be able to tell you more of her deeper thoughts and feelings   If you want to be more than friends with her limit your availability You need to be trusted but you canât become someone she talks to about her relationship problems or issues she doesnât want to tell her relationship partner Always avoid being the kind of person thatâs there to provide money or food Someone who frequently asks you to do this is using you   Once youâve begun building up trust between you have deeper discussions when the timing is right Ask her questions such as what career she wants in the future When you do this listen actively Put down your phone hear what sheâs saying and try to remember it This shows that you care about her as a personRemember important dates such as her birthday Many people have a tendency to forget so it will be impressive to her when you display consideration   Sheâll have a lot of pressures in life including from friends and family Donât add to it Never put her into a spot where sheâd have to make a difficult decision such as forcing her to leave a relationship Give her some personal spaceDonât smother her with attention by calling or texting every day and spending all your time near her Remember to live your life outside of your connection to her Talk to other people Take care of

Dirt and loose hair underneath a saddle can chafe him and cause an uncomfortable ride for both of you  This keeps them out of the way   Alternately you can fold it over the top of the saddle leaving it attached on the righthand off side   For a contoured pad there should be about an inch of pad all the way around For a square pad be sure to leave at least one inch around the front edge of the saddle The saddle should not be so far forward that in makes the shoulder movement hard   The arch of the pommel should be directly over the highest point of the horses withers The saddle will nestle in behind the horses shoulderblades   As a guideline the girth should come under the horse just behind its front legs If you can see a gap between the elbow and the girth the saddle is too far back   Make sure to use the first and third billet straps not the second   Done
In order to attract attention from a popular boy you should dress as though you were a part of the popular group They often wear expensive brands such as Hollister American Eagle or Abercrombie and Fitch Although you could purchase a few sets of clothing from those places you should shop at different stores that sell similar clothing at a lower more reasonable price such as Aeropostale Garage sales or Goodwill are alternate options although you should never let people know that you go there   Although you should draw your inspiration from the popular peoples outfits never lose your own style Dress fashionably but add your own personal preferences in order to stand out If you dress too similarly to the crowd you wont easily catch a popular guys attention You may also be accused of copying   Gradually ease into your new clothes If you make an abrupt change it will cause suspicion within people They may spread rumors about you copying the popular people or attempting to impress someone   Your fashion and wardrobe should change as the year progresses For example when summer comes find clothing in lighter shades such as light pink yellow and purple However once autumn begins to hit adapt to natural colors that inspire thoughts of earth and fall including light brown or grey Include skinny jeans yoga jeans or sweatpants in your outfits Good winter colors are dark blue purple white and black Meanwhile floral clothing is popular in the spring   It is a simple way to add flair to an outfit Have your ears pierced if you like and start wearing necklaces with unique pendants Purchase bracelets watches or rings to attract attention to your hands However beware of adding too many accessories as you will appear tacky and unfashionable   Employ the method of removing one accessory before you leave the house If you feel that you have too many on stick to your gut as you may be right
Before you sit down to have a conversation with your friend about your relationship and where itâs going understand the risks involved in asking to change your friendship into a romantic relationship Your friend could feel the same but they might not You need to prepare for your friend not to feel the way you doWhen assessing the risks you should also decide how you will react to your friendâs potential response If they do not return your feelings are you willing to stay friends Would you rather end the friendship Make sure youâre prepared for whatever reaction you get  Once you feel fully prepared for whatever response you might get ask your friend if you can have a serious conversation   You can say something like âIâd really like to talk to you about something important regarding our friendship Is there a time and a day thatâs good for youâ You can also give them a heads up on whats coming by saying something like Id like to discuss my feelings about you and our relationship When would you be willing to have this conversation   This is a sensitive conversation youâll be having so youâll want to choose somewhere that you and your friend will have some privacy If you are already friends you might be comfortable having this conversation in one of your homes   Donât pick a romantic spot in the hopes that it will sway your friendâs response If the conversation doesnât go the way you want it to being in a romantic restaurant can make things awkward You could also choose a quiet corner of a coffee shop or a nice spot in a public park Depending on how the conversation goes it might be best to have this conversation somewhere that you can both easily leave   When talking to your friend about your feelings be honest and up front about how you feel and what you want for your relationship   You can say something like âI know weâve been friends for a long time but Iâve been feeling like maybe thereâs something more between us I am starting to care about you as more than a friend and I was wondering if youâve felt that way tooâ Emphasize that you donât want to jeopardize your friendship but that your feelings are such that you felt the need to talk to them When youâre admitting feelings to someone else â especially someone that youâve only had a platonic relationship with â itâs easy to feel very vulnerable and as if you deserve a certain response Keep in mind that your friend might not respond the way you want them to and that you have to respect them enough to accept their response whatever it is   If their response is that they dont return your feelings you can say something like I hear what youre saying and I respect your response Lets talk about where we want our relationship to go from here This way your friend knows that youre not going to continue to pursue them romantically but that you want to maintain your friendship If your friend returns your feelings and is also willing to pursue a romantic relationship you can say something like Im really glad you feel the same Where do we go from here This sets up an opportunity for you both to discuss how quickly  or slowly  you want to take your new relationship If your friend asks for time to think about it say something like I understand that this is a lot to think about and I am totally willing to give you some space to consider everything Then ask if you can make a plan to meet in a week or longer or shorter  you can read how your friend is feeling better than anyone to discuss things again
If a person asks you plainly for a date try to respect himher enough to give an honest and straightforward answer Saying I like you as a friend but Im not interested in you romantically may sting a bit but its far less hurtful than leading someone on In most cases the most compassionate thing you can do is tell the truth All you really need to say is No or Im not interested If possible avoid qualifying your no it is not productive to tell the person exactly why you dont want to go out with him or her If you give reasons then you give the asker a chance to defend hisher offer â and you might hurt hisher selfesteemIn some cases a person may explicitly ask you for reasons Why wont you go out with me If you are pushed then feel free to give a few reasons â but keep them broad I dont want to go out with you because youre making me feel uncomfortable or I dont want to go out with you because Im interested in someone else There is no sense in hurting someones feelings and shooting down hisher selfesteem It would be cruel to say I dont want to go out with you because youre short or I wont go out with you because you have bad teeth   Give a general but truthful reason for your no eg I dont want to date anyone right now or Im only dating soandso right now Dont lie When the truth comes out the persons feelings might be hurt If you are genuine kind and straightforward in your rejection it will be hard for anyone to find fault in your actions   An exception is if a stranger asks you out and you want to quickly get away from the situation In this case dont feel bad about lying and giving an excuse such as I have a boyfriend The stranger wont know
Your crush wonât be the one providing your happiness so itâs time to find something else that will Spend time with people who put a smile on your face Watch a funny tv show Do an activity that you enjoy Spend time with an animal that makes you happy Make deliberate choices to put yourself in a happy environment rather than wallowing over what you canât have   When your crush doesnât like you

happiness in the hands of your crush itâs time to take it back and be responsible for yourself Take ownership of your feelings and make the choice to find happiness for yourselfChange your thoughts about what happened Instead of seeing this as a terrible tragedy look at it as an opportunity for growth and exploration One person didnât like you back but lots of other people will Now that you know there isnât a future with this person you can find the right people   Even if itâs hard make sure to respect your crush even when you find out they donât like you If you run into them you can still say hello Theres no need to badmouth them or respond defensively You dont need to be best friends but you can still help them if they need it sometime Itâs ok that they donât feel the same way There are lots of people that you donât feel that way about Sometimes it just doesnât work out and thatâs to be expected It doesnât mean your crush is a bad person and it doesnât mean you are Two great people just didnât happen to feel the same way   Control what you can You canât control your crushâs feelings but you can control your response to them You are far from a passive observer in this You have full control over how you will respond and how you will move forward Choose to think good thoughts to adjust your expectations and to respond in healthy waysDonât let your crushâs rejection change you Your crush doesnât need to have that kind of power over you If you feel hurt thatâs ok but that doesnât need to make you an angry bitter person Keep making good decisions for yourself and make sure that you like who you are regardless of who else does After all youâre the one who has to live with you   Negative feelings can be scary and intimidating It might help you to name them Instead of just sitting there feeling like itâs the end of the world try to put it into words You could write it down tell someone that you trust spend some time thinking about it or talk to a counselor if you are feeling overwhelmed   Maybe you feel sad disappointed and alone If thatâs the case you can help yourself to feel differently You could do a fun activity that makes you feel happy fulfilled and connected to someone such as playing a fun game with a group of close friends You have the power to influence your emotions When your crush doesnât like you this is a form of loss No itâs not the same as losing a loved one but you are still missing someone who mattered to you Itâs okay to acknowledge that and to feel sad about that and to admit that you are hurt by this Itâs only natural to feel this way Spend a bit of time feeling these negative emotions so that you can process them and move past them You donât need to pretend to be perfectly fine when youâre not No one feels great all the time When someone isnât able to give you what you need itâs time to move on It isnât healthy to keeping longing for someone who isnât interested You will only set yourself up for heartbreak To get past this you need to say goodbye to the high hopes you had for you and your crush Admit to yourself that it didnât work out this time and donât let your crush occupy your heart and mind anymore This probably means keeping your distance for a while It is hard to let go of someone if you are constantly with themYou might want to consider not following them on social media anymore or taking a break from social media It is difficult to get over someone if you are constantly being informed of every detail in their life   To help yourself feel better distract your mind so that you arent thinking about your crushs rejection You could play games read books draw play an instrument or watch TV Anything that takes your mind off your crush will help put you at ease while you move forward   Even in a negative and sad situation there are always positives that you can find If you train yourself to look for these instead of dwelling on the negatives you will be much happier and able to handle any of lifeâs storms When your crush doesnât like you it means you wonât have a future with that person but it also opens you up to other opportunities and experiences A lot of good can come from a difficult situationFor example you now have more time to pursue other interests You have more time to spend with friends You have a chance to look around and see what other people you might be interested in instead of being so focused on one person You can take time to invest in yourself You donât need to worry about the struggles and difficulties inevitably present in any romantic relationship You can learn about yourself from this experience
