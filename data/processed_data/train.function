Nothing is more tragic than the ohsocliche friendlikesfriendwhodoesntlikeherthatway drama Be sure that you arent considered one of the guys or just his bud Of course you have to get to know him first and you may possibly just gain an amazing friend in the process which is all right some pursued crushes could turn out to be one of your best friends but be a little more flirty with him in a way that youre sure one of his buds wouldnt beFor example to set yourself apart from âone of the guysâ maybe give him a hug a playful peck on the cheek or play with his hair   Your crush may be attracted to you if you let him share details about his life This shows that youâre really interested in him and what he has to say Try not to always talk about yourself he wants to know about you but give him a chance to share about himself   If he asks questions about you answer them but donât focus on yourself for too long You can steer the conversation toward him by asking questions like âHow many siblings do you haveâ or âWhat is your favorite thing about your familyâ Ask about his interests or hobbies by saying something along the lines of âHave you read any good books recentlyâ or âWhat videogames do you like to playâ   One of the best ways to demonstrate to a guy that you like him and enjoy his company is to laugh at his jokes This boosts his confidence and signals to him that you have a similar sense of humor and find the same things funny For many people a sense of humor is one of the most important qualities they look for in a significant otherIf he says something that you find funny join in or add your own joke For example if youâre talking about a celebrity you could add something that you find to be amusing to the conversation Avoid being too mean such as making fun of other peopleâs appearances or mocking individuals you both know You donât want to come off as someone who will make fun of him behind his back or come off as cruel   If you know where your crush likes to spend his time you can get yourself noticed by showing up there every so often For example if he has a favorite coffee shop in the area you could go there with a friend or two on the off chance you might see him there You could also study or do your homework there   If you know that heâs going to a concert see if you can get tickets to go as well This can provide a chance for you to bump into him and say hello This could even give you a reason to hang out together Try joining a club or activity that he is a part of This could also give you a reason to talk and hang out Be careful not to show up where he is all the time or he may get annoyed or think you are stalking him Just be yourself and if he happens to enjoy the same activities as you even better
There are a number of symptoms referred to as presyncope that you may experience immediately before fainting Most fainting spells occur when you are standing and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint In addition awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint   Common symptoms include yawning a sudden sweat nausea sickness fast and deep breathing confusion lightheadedness blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes and ringing in your ears   The symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning If you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct antigravity measures which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms can help you avoid a fainting episode   Medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees These positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode If standing you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles This is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately  By preparing you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint Try telling someone near you what is happening and ask for assistance try lying down or try bracing yourself against a wall to prepare If you find yourself on stairs or other precarious surroundings sit down and hold on to a railing immediately   If you do faint blood flow will resume to your brain naturally and you should regain consciousness in two minutes or less It is normal to feel weak and confused for 20 to 30 minutes after fainting Remain calm when you regain consciousness Also take some time to lay on your back to allow blood flow back to the brain You should also hydrate yourself with water  Fainting spells are not necessarily an indication of a serious medical condition In fact fainting spells may be caused by anxiety fear pain emotional stress hunger dehydration surprise overexertion clenching spasms choking or drug and alcohol use If you suspect that your fainting spells are being caused by one of these issues there are measures you can take to prevent future episodes   Hydration is the best way to prevent fainting spells without medication Drinking more water is ideal but you can get fluids from food sources like watermelon milk soups etc All caffeinated beverages including sodas should be eliminated If you are sufficiently hydrated you will be urinating regularly and your urine will be clear or light colored not dark Caffeine stimulates the heart making fainting spells more likely to occur If you drink large amounts of caffeine you should cut back slowly to avoid headaches While the amount of fluids you need each day depends on a number of factors â including your level of activity your climate your overall health and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding you should drink about half of your weight in ounces each day So if you weigh 200 lbs then you should be consuming 100 oz or 125 8oz glasses of fluids each dayIf you are an athlete with more musclemass you should drink about twothirds of your weight in ouncesEating regularly can also help to reduce lightheadedness and reduce your chance of fainting by boosting blood sugar   If anxiety and stress are causing fainting spells calming techniques can help you avoid fainting spells You can try counting your breaths or deep breathing flexing and relaxing different muscle groups and paying attention to the immediate moment rather than the past or future also known as mindfulness Avoid placing yourself in stressful situations and do your best to remove yourself from such situations Learning to stay calm and to assert yourself can help you to overcome feelings of anxiety   The flushed look that many people get when they drink alcohol is actually blood rushing to the surface of the skin This takes blood away from the brain and can cause fainting episodes Excessive drinking also causes dehydration which is a leading cause of fainting spells Illegal drugs particularly stimulants such as cocaine or ecstasy also cause fainting spells These should be avoided   While it is possible that fainting spells are not related to medical conditions it is also possible that they are a sign of a medical problem To determine this you will need to visit your doctor You should see your doctor immediately if you experience fainting while exercising if fainting occurs with rapid heartbeat or if your family has a history of fainting If you experience repeated fainting spells you should consult your doctor  Your doctor will ask a number of questions to determine the cause of your fainting These may include the situation you find yourself in when you faint how long the episodes last how quickly it takes you to return to normal and any other symptoms you may experience during the episodes The doctor may also order a number of tests to determine the cause of your fainting spells   An electrocardiogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects a heart condition is the cause An electroencephalogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects something in the brain is the cause  There is a chance that your doctor will not recommend any medication for your fainting spells There is no medicine that treats fainting spells themselves so your doctor may instead prescribe a medicine to treat the cause of the fainting spells These may include medicine for low blood sugar seizures anemia or low blood pressure   If any medications are prescribed be sure to take them exactly as your doctor advises

Leopards and jaguars are both skillful hunters but leopards are the only known big cat that carries its dead prey into a tree Leopards also climbjump out of trees headfirstIf you witness the animal carry its prey into a tree it is definitely a leopard However that doesnt necessarily mean that leopards will do this every time   There is a distinct behavioral difference between leopards and jaguars when it comes to being in the water Both jaguars and leopards are skilled swimmers but jaguars will actively spend time in water whereas leopards will generally try to avoid being in the water as much as possible Both cats are strong skillful predators However jaguars are typically more willing than leopards to fight a larger animal species Leopards by contrast will usually run away from larger creatures like lions anacondas or even hyenas

Instead of focusing on all of the reasons you are drawn to your crush you need to change your focus and consider all of the reasons why the crush can lead to no good and is not worth pursuing There are many different reasons why any crush can be inappropriate and its important to know exactly what youd be getting yourself into in order to avoid it You should think about why the crush is a bad idea and consider potential reasons that you may be feeling what youre feeling other than the initial attraction of course Here are some potential reasons you may be dealing with   If heshes a lot younger than you are or heshes a lot older than you are why are you interested in a young or old partner whose interests and priorities will be very different from your own If you are into a guy who works for you are you more into the idea that you can call the shots than the actual person If you have a crush on your brothers girlfriend is it more about getting one over on your brother than actual interest in the girl It might be that for a series of circumstances you are feeling needy and vulnerable making it a bad time to take any action    If one or both parents had extramarital affairs when you were growing up or if you have a history of infidelity you may have some underlying issues that need to be addressed to successfully enjoy a committed relationship   For example if you have a crush on a guy but are already in a relationship then you have to ask yourself if the crush is really meaningful or if this is your way of telling yourself that its not really working out with you and your boyfriend If you and your boyfriend were really happy together then would you have room to develop strong feelings for another person   Of course everyone even the happiest couples can get harmless little crushes from time to time but if your crush turns more serious then you should question your current relationship This is your chance to exit without serious consequences if there is a problem You should especially question the status of your current relationship if this kind of thing keeps happening If you occasionally really click with someone outside of your relationship and feel a harmless crush on him or her while knowing it wont lead to anything thats one thing but if you feel frequently embroiled in a onesided love affair then you have to wonder about the real reason behind your feelings   If you were to get involved with this person how would the fallout affect you HerHim Your friends family coworkers Think as if it were a chess game and visualize the next several moves If I do this then she will do that then my brother will hate me then the first time we argue I will lose my job and so on Thinking about the worst that could happen if you and your crush were united can make you realize that it would be a huge mistake   Ask yourself is the potential relationship with this person worth all the trouble you will endure and what are the chances the relationship would survive all of the chaos that will ensue   What will other people think â will they think more or less of you Though we often say that it doesnt matter what people think and that love conquers all in some cases the fact of the matter is that what other people think does matter because their disapproval or even their scorn may make it very difficult for you to carry out your potential inappropriate relationship Its important to step back and look at the big picture to consider how other people would react to your relationship If youre already certain its inappropriate then considering how others would react will further dissuade you Here are some scenarios to consider   Its not cool to try to steal your buddys girl You might end up with her but you will lose your friend If youre older and the boy is a minor you will be considered a cradlerobber âand on top of that if you actually pursue that relationship into a sexual situation you could be looking at jail Sex with a minor is worse than inappropriate â its a crime Sure you may have a crush on your wifes sister But imagine what would happen if you did anything about it â would your wife ever be able to look you in the eye Would her family ever forgive you   If you get involved with someone inappropriate you will not just be dealing with problems now You will be dealing with the fallout far â maybe years â into the future Its one thing to think about the exciting adventures youll have with your inappropriate crush if he or she returns you feelings but its another try to imagine what your relationship will really look like in a few years Will it really be possible to sustain it Will your feelings really last Its important to think about whether you can really have a future with this person or if you would just be sacrificing everything for a few fleeting moments of joy   For instance the person you are crazy about may not be a very nice person You start ditching your friends and family to spend time with her Shes super flaky and you become flaky too â going back on your word because she wasnt willing to do whatever it was you promised youd do â and wont let you do it either Even after you break up with her everyone you know will still view you with distrust They will question your judgment for ever getting involved with someone like that in the first place   Almost by definition a crush involves an idealized picture of someone else But everyone is human and even your crush has characteristics that are probably not pleasant Perhaps he says mean things to people or maybe she listens to music that you think is dumb Or perhaps he or she merely ignores you Try to work up some negative energy about the person that you can focus on in order to weaken the crush   Write down a list of all of the negative qualities of your crush If you really think your crush is perfect and you cant think of a single thing that is wrong with him or her then this means that you dont know the person well enough If you cant think of a single thing wrong with your crush then you have him or her up on a pedestal One of the reasons your crush may be inappropriate is simply because the person is bad for you Writing down the reasons why such as the fact that the person abuses alcohol or is a known player can help you see that while you may get butterflies in your stomach when you see him hes no good for you in the long run   Now that youve analyzed considered and really meditated upon how terrible this idea is you need to stop obsessing over this person No matter how tempting it is to think about himher fantasize and get yourself all tingly doing it stop it Think about and do something else In loose psychological terms its called redirecting behaviors and thought patterns You have to find ways to stay busy and to stop thinking about your inappropriate crush If all you do is sit around the house all day then your inappropriate crush will be a lot harder to forget than if you throw yourself into your work and studies and have an active social life   At first not thinking about your crush will be even harder because youll be so busy thinking about nothing thinking about him or her But have faith â soon enough youll be on your way to moving forward Learn to redirect your thoughts Train yourself to think about something else every time you start thinking about himher â think about how much you love the person youre with instead Think about how much work you have to get done If youre at home turn on the radio or TV and get some other thoughts running through your head If you still feel yourself reverting to thoughts of your forbidden crush find someone to talk to call a friend Ask that friend if he or she wants to hang out â you can get out of the house and stop thinking about your crush Throw yourself into a new hobby or an activity Try tennis yoga writing short stories or training for a 5K Though these activities alone wont make you forget your crush they will bring more richness to your life and will help you think of other things   If you can remove yourself from that person as much as possible the crush will weaken In order to sustain our adoration for someone we generally need to reinforce it by seeing the person Absence usually doesnt make the heart grow fonder actually Of course this isnt always practical but do what you can to minimize contact with the other person Try to avoid doing anything dramatic while finding a way to limit the time you spend with your crush   Unfortunately there are some cases where it would be quite hard to limit contact with the person entirely If you have a crush on your married boss and it wont go away for example you may have to consider looking for another job If you have a crush on your professor and it wont go away see if you can switch into another class If you do have to be in the same room as the person try to minimize eye contact and conversation You shouldnt make things extra awkward by avoiding or ignoring the person entirely but you should limit how much time you spend interacting   All crushes fade with time If you can avoid doing something regrettable and keep your feelings in check eventually those powerful emotions will run their course You may feel like youre trapped and that you are bound to have these feelings forever but that wont be the case One day youll be looking back on this moment wondering how you could have harbored such feelings If you have faith that you wont always feel this way youll be on the way to getting over it   Unfortunately theres no timeline for how long it takes to get over a crush But if you go about living a busy and fulfilling life instead of spending all your time moping and pining youll be guaranteed to get over it faster   If youre single then you should begin to put yourself out there when youre starting to get over your crush You dont have to feel 100 cured but you should feel like youre ready to start a meaningful relationship with someone else â if youre still completely lovesick then it wont be fair to the other person to start dating just to distract yourself But once youre ready ask a friend to set you up or be open to meeting new people Youll soon find that your crush is far from your thoughts   It doesnt matter if that person does not measure up to your wrong crush What does matter is that you spend some time in the pleasant company of someone other than that person Start dating others and keep an open mind That person is off limits to you and you have to start rewiring your brain to think about being with someone else   Lets face it sometimes you cant convince yourself that you dont feel the way you feel If youve tried to fight it all to no avail and you still find yourself sighing over himher then make it right There are ways to make an inappropriate crush totally appropriate â the most important thing to remember is to make it right first â and then and only then âget involved And then true love wins the day   If shes your brothers girl then you have to behave as a gallant gentleman and never hit on her If your brother breaks up with her you can ask your brother if hed mind you asking her out Maybe he wouldnt mind and there certainly is precedent for it If he doesnt break up with her or if he wont give you permission youre out of luck unless you are prepared to accept the consequences â your brother may not speak to you If youre interested in someone much younger wait for himher Dont get involved with anyone Bide your time remain friendly but dont get too close Love him or her from afar until it is appropriate For example if youre a high school senior and have been yearning for your earlytwenties math teacher for years wait until you graduate and get some more life experience before you decide whether or not you want to pursue the relationship If you are falling for your subordinate then you must decide what measures you should take at work before you pursue the relationship You can transfer to another department or take on a different position or do whatever you have to do at work so that your relationship would not be viewed as inappropriate or a power play
You have to show your Christian guy that you are mature enough when it comes to spiritual matters by showing how keen you are to worship As a Christian you may consider this deception as you havent arrived early to praise the Lord you are there early to try to get a boy to like you  This will be more successful if the Christian boy you like goes to the Bible classes or youth groups If he does not you might meet someone new   Show the Christian Boy you are having fun at these events Smile laugh be generous and warm A Christian guy should love a Christian girl that serves the Lord with joy and amusement   You need to look nice appear to be a good listener and a fun person to be with This will attract people with similar qualities to you   The Christian boy will think everyone can talk to you during the Hour of Worship If your church doesnt have an Hour of Worship try paying attention to the service and praying in respectful silence Christian Boys usually like girls who behave appropriately in Church at all times   Dont act in any way that could be interpreted as immature It is suggested that you should behave yourself when inside the church in a way appropriate for your age   Whenever you have the chance to talk to him take the opportunity If you are shy and hes shy also nothing will happen so if you want to make a boy like you be brave and talk to him   For example you could say Hey you know what you really did a great job handing out the hymn books   Or if the Christian boy has done a good job explaining something in some church related activity you could say I really did understand the  topic and it has now become easier for me to explain it to others Go on to say Hmm I am thinking if maybe you could give me some Bible studies over  Place Your Christian boy may start to like you if you ask him to help you with your bible studies especially if he can also help you with your English Try saying Hi by doing this you will look lovely This may not make him like you This may just make him think you are friendly   Look mature look religious and respectable You dont have to dress like youre going at a party or on a red carpet or go too far the other way a dress as a nun   Appropriate church clothes may make a boy like you Look presentable and youll feel comfortable If you want to put some makeup keep it natural Face powder blush on and lip gloss will do Remember some Christian Boys like teen girls who dont wear any makeup   Youre inside the church so respect God Behave yourself and dont go like Ah I saw him OMG These are suitable things to say in Church   Remember that youre inside a sacred place However since you have already been gazing around looking for a boy to try to make like you this may not be of great concern to you Theoretically you shouldnt be trying to make a boy from church like you in Church   This can be a great help for starting conversations with him Talk about God and His disciples and the prophets to make him like you
Try not to overthink the situation Though you want to talk to this girl very much remember that she is not perfect and may be as nervous as you Girls have emotions and feelings just like you do and may be wondering the right way to approach you as well Or she may be waiting on you to make the first move   Breathe deeply before you talk to her Deep breaths help calm you down  When you see her greet her with a sweet smile Smiles indicate friendliness and warmth You may have never smiled at her before so she may have no idea that you want to talk to her Smiling at her will plant a seed in her mind that you have some level of interest She wonât be as caught off guard when you actually do speak to her   If you see her in the mornings or walk past her on your way to class tell her âhelloâ This will likely begin to spark an interest in her to know more about you and to talk to you This also will guarantee that she notices youUnless you have spoken to her before however donât use her name when you say âhelloâ She might find it creepy if you know her name but she doesnât know you or yours especially if you go to a big school Donât look up any information about her either because this can come across as stalkerlike behavior   One way to begin having small conversations with her is to ask her for a small favor This is another way to guarantee that she notices you For instance you might ask her something like âcan you grab a cup for meâ if she is standing by the cups in the cafeteriaYou might also ask something like âcan you let me borrow a pencilâ if you have a class with her just make sure that you give the pencil back   Another great way to begin having small conversations is to ask her small questions She will appreciate the opportunity to be able to help you if you ask questions like âwhat page did the teacher say we should turn toâ or âwhat is our homework assignment for tonightâIf youâre lucky she may begin to rely on you when she has questions as well and then you can spark up conversations   You can also begin the conversation with her by making small statements that donât necessarily require a response Saying things like âwow itâs a nice day todayâ or âthis lunch is so goodâ are great ways to speak to her without fear because such does not require her to respond However she will likely respond to you if she is interested so continue the conversation from there One way to impress a girl that you have not yet spoken to is to always look great Get up a few minutes earlier in the mornings and take a little extra time to get ready A girl is more likely to notice you if you come to school looking handsome and clean cut regularly   Pick your outfit out the night before and iron it so your clothes look neat Maintain your hygiene Shower regularly and wear deodorant Brush your teeth and floss Put on lotion and wear chapstick Get haircuts regularly to maintain a sharp hairstyle If you have long hair wash it regularly and comb it to keep it neat Wear cologne but donât overdo it Most girls enjoy when boys smell nice   Be very respectful to her and avoid staring or making forward comments Many girls have guys approaching them on the streets or on social media making inappropriate comments often Do your best to avoid being one of these kind of guys at all costs A girl is unlikely to talk to you if she feels uncomfortable or if she feels that you only want her physically   For example avoid saying things like âhey babyâ or ânice buttâ to her She may think these comments are strange or offensive Avoid using cheesy pickup lines or making comments about her body   Though this girl may be wonderful you must remember that she is also probably looking to connect and make friends with people too Before you approach her take some time to think about all of the good aspects about you as well If you are a loyal friend or a kind person show those qualities to the girl when you speak to her without being cocky or bragging Confidence comes from experience you cannot fake it or if you do you can only fake for so long Be honest with yourself and about yourself   You are probably going to feel nervous to some extent Accept it Remember that she is just another person do not put her on a pedestal or have any expectations when approaching her Just be genuinely interested in what she has to say and let the conversation unfold as naturally as possible Some ways that you can project confidence are to stand up straight and maintain eye contact with the girl When you do approach her donât stammer over your words or mumble even if you are nervous Speak calmly assuredly and with earnest behavior Most girls like boys who are confident when they speak and find it easier to have conversations with themSpeak slightly louder than you normally would if you have been told that you are soft spokenDonât overtalk her either Confidence is not about being the loudest or speaking the most It might be best to let her do most of the talking Try coming up with a list of openended questions to get her talking about herself These are questions that do not have a simple yes and no answer They invite elaboration For example you could ask her âWhat do you like to do for funâ or âHow was your dayâ This will help to show that you are a good listener and you can learn more about her in the process   Donât get caught up in thinking negatively about yourself or what could go wrong when you talk to her Think positively and positive things will likely come to you The girl will also likely feel this positivity from you and enjoy your spirit and personality Most people donât like hanging around people who are negative so practice positivity before speaking to her   Often times lunch period can provide a great time for conversation because this is allotted free time during your school day However there are other times that work well too For instance in the beginning of the school day there is some time that you could make to speak to her After class is another great time   Speaking to her when she is around a large group of friends could be risky unless you are friends with some of them Try to talk to her when she is alone or only with one or two friends   After you have successfully began making small talk with her you can now have an actual conversation Ask her how her day is going to show that you are interested in her life Most people enjoy talking about themselves so she will likely welcome the opportunity and be flattered that you asked   You can approach her and say something like âHey howâs your day going so farâ   There is an old adage that says that âthe way to a womanâs heart is to make her laughâ If you donât know her making her laugh might be difficult since you arenât aware of her sense of humor However you can work on picking out little funny things about your school that she is likely to find funny   For instance maybe your teacher does something that is funny to you like using the word âirregardlessâ You could say something humorous like âI think itâs so funny how we have an English teacher who uses words that arenât wordsâ   Take some time when you talk to her to find out more about her as a person If you donât know her name start there If you donât know what year she is ask her if sheâs the same year as you She will gradually begin to open up and you can start asking more personal questions like âwhat do you like to do for funâ or âwhatâs your favorite movieâ   Talk about yourself some as well but donât overdo it You donât want to dominate the conversation You might say something like âIâm in the 7th grade tooâ or âI got into college and Iâm really excited about itâ She will likely ask some questions about you as well   After establishing some rapport with her you can pay her a small compliment Donât give compliments that are physical or that are overly detailed just yet She may be put off by that and uncomfortable talking to you thereafter   You might say something like âyouâre really good at soccerâ or âI saw you stick up for your friend to that bully Youâre a really nice friend it seemsâ   If you have spoken with her several times then you might try asking her to sit with you For example you can invite her to sit with you at lunch so you can talk some more If she still wants to sit with her friends donât be pushy You can try asking her again at a later time once you have had more conversations   She may be intimidated to sit with you if you sit with a lot of your guy friends so tell her that you two can sit alone if she likes   The conversations with her donât have to stop after this first real interaction You can continue to speak to her after this even when you are not at school Ask her for her phone number and see if sheâs okay with you calling or texting her sometimes   Ask her something like âI really have enjoyed talking to you Can I have your number so I can call or text you sometimeâ She may prefer to give you her social media information You can talk to her that way as well Her parents may be strict and may not allow her to talk to boys If so be respectful You can still talk to her at school
One of the first things that might stand out to you making you curious if a girl is interested in you is her desire to be intentional with you Is there a girl in your life who is really trying to get to know you or spend time with you A girl may be interested in you if shes asking you personal questions showing that she cares about your life and wants to know you moreDont confuse this with a girl who is just being friendly Some girls may just be really good at initiating conversation with people or may have a knack for small talk Look beyond that to the girls who seem to be going out of their way to learn more about you and develop a relationship with you When a girl spends time getting to know you and learns about your hobbies and interests you may begin to see her taking interests in those things as well She may be doing this so that you two have more in common or so that you find her more interesting and inviting  Not only might a girl who is interested in you seek out ways to get to know you she may also become more vulnerable around you If you are unsure if a girl likes you pay attention to how much she is opening up around you If you ask her somewhat personal questions and she seems offended or taken aback it may be a sign that shes not interested in you But if she seems willing to open up and tell you things she wouldnt tell everyone she may be interested in youGirls can be complicated and there is no perfect formula for understanding them so dont assume that just because she is opening up to you she must like you On the opposite end dont assume that just because she is more closed off or quiet that she dislikes you Some girls feel more comfortable being vulnerable with people while others take more time to show their entire self to people Be patient with girls and if you feel that one may like you try to be vulnerable with her and see if she is vulnerable back Overtime if you continue this she should open up if shes interested in you   Girls often like to drop hints to people that they are interested in so that they dont have to be the first one to make a move These can range from sharing their interests or explaining that they want to do something and dont have someone to do it with Look for signs that a girl is obviously trying to show you that she wants you to initiate   Hints can be difficult because they are just that  hints  and it can hard to know what the girl is actually communicating If she says shes been wanting to see a certain movie but no one has wanted to go with her she may be hinting to you that you should ask to go with her or she may just be stating a fact As always feel out the situation to figure out what shes really trying to say In this case you may just have to be bold and ask her what shes really trying to say or initiate with her and risk the chance that she wasnt hinting anything to you Another way a girl might drop a hint is explaining she needs help on something This is the opportunity for you to offer to help her Even if she really just needs help and isnt trying to hint at anything you havent lost anything by offering your help   If a girl is interested in you and has told her friends that she likes you you may be able to see a reaction from all of them when you approach them Some girls are subtle and are good at hiding their emotions while others may be surrounded by a group of friends that start giggling or acting strange when you walk up to them Changes in behavior in a girl when you approach can be a helpful sign to show she likes you   If the two of you are involved in the same organization or have the same group of friends pay attention to how she is spending her time in group settings Is she spending time with a particular group of friends the whole time is she jumping from group to group or is she spending most of her time with you If you find that she is giving you extra attention over others it may be because shes into youIf you two are already close friends and she would normally spend more time with you this probably isnt helpful But if you are in this situation and you find that shes spending a lot of time with someone else instead of you it may be a sign that she is interested in that other person and not you If you are in a room with a group of people and shes across the room try making eye contact with her You may notice that shes already been looking at you or when she notices you looking at her she may smile shyly or show that shes happy to see you Watch the expression that comes on her face whenever you make eye contact with her It could be a sign that she likes you   Some girls will use social media as an outlet to show others what is going on in their lives and so if you are a big part of her life you may see that she has several pictures with you that shes posted She also may be very attentive to your social media pages liking your pictures and statuses Any of these things could be a sign that shes into you   As always some girls wont use social media to broadcast your relationship especially if they are insecure or arent sure that you like them as well Just because a girl doesnt have pictures of you on her Instagram or Facebook doesnt mean shes not into you   Because relationships and people are complicated and cant be put into a box you may meet a girl who is crazy about you and doesnt show any of these signs or you may meet someone who has no interest in you and does all of these things With that being said try not to overanalyze her behavior Be patient get to know her and over time you may be able to have a conversation about it rather than just depending on her actions for complete confidence that she likes you   One of the common ways to tell if a girl likes you is when she flirts with you A girl may be interested in you if she laughs a lot when shes around you if she initiates physical touch like touching your shoulder or giving you hugs or if she playfully argues with you Because every girl is different flirting doesnt always mean a girl is interested but its a good beginning sign to know if she sees you as potentialSome girls dont realize they are flirting or their natural way to interact with others is by being somewhat flirty and playful Others wont flirt at all for fear of rejection so dont place girls in a box when it comes to flirting On the other hand a girl may be interested in you but not flirt with you because she is shy or nervous So in this case pay attention to the less obvious signs of flirting Look to see if she blushes when shes around you if she laughs nervously at your jokes or she shifts her clothes or hair while shes talking to you These could all be signs that shes into you but doesnt feel comfortable outright flirting with you As she walks away look to see if theres still a smile on her face This could definitely be a sign that she likes you because youve left her feeling giddy after shes talked to you   Body language is a great way to feel out a situation and figure out if a girl is interested in you If you are with a girl and she seems distant or her arms are crossed in front of her and shes not making eye contact with you it may be a sign that shes not interested But if she is being intentional about making eye contact with you moves closer to you as you two talk and tenderly smiles at you she may like you   Watch how she holds herself too If there is a girl who really wants to get your attention she may look more confident when shes around you because she wants to show you that shes worth looking at She may do this around you and engage with you or she may show confidence but act like shes preoccupied with other things This may be because shes trying to play hard to get or she wants you to be jealous Sometimes a girl can feel distant because she is nervous uncomfortable or doesnt know how to act around you It doesnt always mean that she isnt interested in you so in this situation the best way to make her comfortable is to show her that she can trust you Cozy up to her and look into her eyes instead She may feel uncomfortable but eventually she may decide opening up to you physically is worth the risk As with flirting dont believe that just because a girl makes eye contact with you it means she likes you You really have to feel out the situation with girls and observe how she acts around others as well If she seems tender and open with everyone else she may not be acting that way around you because she likes you However if she seems more closed off with others but with you her body language shows she is more at ease or flirty then it may be evidence that she likes you   If a girl is trying to impress you she may spend more time on her outfit hair or makeup She wants you to notice her and think shes attractive so whenever she knows that shes going to be around you shes likely going to primp herself more than she usually does If you notice that she suddenly looks more stylish or done up than she used to it may be a sign that shes into you   This could be difficult to tell if the girl you think is interested in you has always looked really nice If this is the case continue to pay attention to see if she does something different This will require you to be more observant than you might have been See if she changes her hair color tries out a new style of clothing or wears a new perfume As with all of the other tips dont expect that every girl is going to dress nicer for you when they are interested in you Its really a girls personal preference and some wont see the need to make you notice them by their looks Some girls may feel confident enough to just be themselves Also dont get confused if a girl is dressing up but shes really doing it for someone else Try to pay attention to who she is dressing up around and when shes dressing up For example if you see her with a group of her friends and she wasnt expecting to see you look to see if she is dressed up If she seems to be dressed rather casually and hasnt done anything special to her hair or makeup but she looks much more dolled up when shes around you it may be because shes interested in you   While a girl may try to get to know you better because she likes you a great way to understand her feelings and intentions is by getting to know her better yourself As you spend time with her and talk with her ask her questions about her life and pay attention to how she relates to you and to othersThis is the step where you can also begin to talk about your relationship if you are relatively confident something is going on between the two of you While this is similar to looking for intentionality and vulnerability its different in that you play bigger role You want to make her feel comfortable and that shes in a safe place And if you like her too you should have the desire to understand who she is and how she works   If you are unsure if a girl is interested in you the best way to find out is by asking her to spend time with you A girl who is interested in someone will almost certainly say yes to this and someone who isnt interested in you may or may not say yes but it will take you one step further to figuring out how she feels about you   Ask her to hang out in a casual setting that way if shes actually not interested you havent placed yourself in an awkward position If she is interested it will give her a comfortable relaxed environment to open up to you Observe her throughout the night to determine if she seems like she just sees you as a friend or if shes looking at you as more than that   Maybe youve looked for all of the other signs that a girl likes you but are still unsure Now is the time where you can seek out information and insight from her friends and others Talk to other people who have been in relationships and ask them how they knew the other was interested Ask her friends if she is interested in anyone or if they already know you are interested in her too ask them how you can best approach their friendDont use her friends as an excuse to not be bold and take risks yourself You dont want her friends to be the messengers to her and you definitely dont want to tell her you are interested in her through her friends Use her friends as helpful advice on how you can better act in this situation and if you are absolutely clueless they may steer you in a good direction   Some girls will flirt no matter who the person is but others wont flirt unless they have first been flirted with If this is your girl and she seems shy and uncertain try flirting with her speaking tenderly with her laughing with her and giving her hugs If shes interested in you she may flirt back and if walls still seem to be up it might be a sign that shes not into you   This is not always a great idea especially if you are unsure if a girl is interested in you But if you feel like youve had some time to read the signs and are pretty confident that shes into you then you can try asking her boldly if she likes you are is interested Do this in a gentle way and only if you plan to take the relationship further   If you dont plan to ask this girl out or develop a relationship with her asking her if she likes you and then doing nothing may come across as hurtful or insincere So if you dont like her then just leave it at that  theres really no reason for you to know if she likes you But if you do like her and want the relationship to move into something different than ask her if shes interested in you and explain that you feel the same way A gentle way to approach this would be by first explaining to her that you are interested in her and then leaving her the option to tell you how she feels about you This creates a safe zone for her which allows her to be vulnerable but with the knowledge that its not in vain
Before you begin oiling your saddle be sure to warm your oil The oil needs to be warm at most 100 degrees Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius but not hot Hot oil can cook your leather and ruin it In order to guarantee that itâs the right temperature try soaking it in lukewarm water for about 20 minutes Once you have properly cleaned your saddle gently apply a light coat of oil to the grain smooth or outward facing side of the saddle You can use a brush or a rag to very lightly apply the oil Do not let the oil pool or build up on the leather This will oversaturate it and ruin the leather Avoid using any heavy oils like olive or neatsfoot oil Follow the manufacturerâs recommended oil or conditionerSome saddles require few oilings and a few never need to be oiled Be sure to follow the manufacturerâs guidelines before you condition your saddle Use a rag or tack sponge to apply oil to the saddle Be sure to use a circular motion to get an even application This will help you avoid spotting You can also use your hand to apply the oil if you find some hard to reach placesAvoid applying oil to the flesh side or any rawhide parts of the saddle This will cause them to loosen and stretch out Instead of rubbing it with oil soak your bridle in a shallow pan full of oil Once you have covered the grain in oil let it sit for a day or two This will allow the oil to soak into the leather Keep the saddle in a dry and climate controlled location Avoid placing it in direct sunlightIf you are oiling the saddle for the first time you may want to let it sit for longer After the saddle has sat for a couple days take a rag and wipe off any excess oil You should also use a rag to buff the saddle as you wipe off the excess rubbing in a circular motion This will help prevent any spotting or discoloration in the leatherAvoid using the saddle again until it is completely dry   If you are oiling your saddle for the first time you may need to condition it at least three times over the course of a couple of weeks You may want to pay particular attention to the fenders and the seat which will need a little help loosening upBe sure to follow the manufacturerâs guidelines when oiling your saddle Over conditioning the saddle can make it too loose and ruin it Because they are used regularly you may want to apply more oil to the fenders The seat may need some extra oil to make it form to your bottom   After the saddle is properly oiled you may want to rub in a little conditioner This will help treat the leather and prevent it from drying out Simply apply a small amount of conditioner to a rag and gently rub it into the leather Be sure to use a commercial leather conditioner that is appropriate for your saddle Your local western ware store should have saddle conditionerConditioner is particularly important if you live in an arid climate where your saddle can get dried out Be sure to follow the saddle manufacturerâs guidelines before applying any conditioner to your saddle
Your eyes are very powerful when it comes to body language They can indicate interest and indicate if hes interested as well Eye contact increases your heartbeat and helps to release the hormones associated with love or lustFix your gaze on a guy youre interested in if youre not already acquainted with him or talking to him Show that youre sizing him upââlocking eyes is a sure sign of continued interest Do a face scan This is a telltale sign of interest Darting glances and second looks can help indicate your interest in him Avoid staring he might go into flight mode Keep it casual and always smile  Do just enough to let him see the change in your expression without it looking forced or overdone Its important to look amused not disgusted But remember not to overreact theyll think you are too interested   But not too much This makes you seem innocent yet still interested As you do this glance down or at the other shoulder   Open your mouth a little more but not so much that your mouth looks overly wide too much and you look like a fish gasping for air This makes you look flattered and also gives the impression that youre a good kisser which guys are gonna want   Only move your shoulder and not your whole arm As you bring your shoulder forward move your head slightly closer to it As you drop your shoulder move your head back up   Try looking over your shoulder this positioning accentuates your curves and invites more attention   This keeps him wanting more and wondering what you meant by flirting with him and then moving on   Once hes started to show interest make him keener by getting closer Move near him and touch his hand or the base of his arm or gently squeeze his arm hand or shoulder while youre talking Nothing hard just light quick touches before withdrawing your hand again   Lean in and whisper Speaking softly will reel him in Hes interested if he moves closer but beware if he moves back from your leanin it means he lacks interest If he flinches or tenses when touched it probably means hes nervous around you and that you might be moving in too fast Try to act more relaxed around him   Slowly run your fingers through your hair stopping at the nape of your neck Once your fingers reach your neck either trail your fingers back and forth across your collarbone or move the pendant on your necklace back and forth Caressing your body in this way will cause an interested guy to watch intently   Watch for his lips parting or touching his mouth with his fingers youre right in his interest zone once this happens   Everyone else is already taken   Make yourself look appealing Acting or looking dumb in front of him when youre actually really smart will make him confused He will start to wonder if youre all truth or just lies Its okay to do this in the beginning just to get him to notice or talk to you in a good way but once you strike up a conversation be yourself and act natural Where to look When you two are in a conversation stare at his lips and MAKE SURE you are listening to what he is saying too An instant turnoff is when a guy thinks you are just taking advantage of him
Not only should you be looking for eye contact but you should also notice his pupils If he is looking at you while you talkâgreat If his pupils are larger than normalâeven better Dilation is a brain response that occurs when someone is attracted to somethingIf his eye contact is shaky it most likely means that he wants to get out of the situation that heâs in   Excessive blinking is another strong indication someone is attracted to you For some people blink rate spikes when theyâre emotionally excited   If his eyebrows are raises slightly this means that he finds you fascinating This is a subconscious expression that happens when a man likes what he sees He may not always have direct eye contact when heâs speaking to you but that doesnât mean he isnât interested If his eyes wander take note of where theyâre going If heâs checking you outâheâs obviously interested If he seems to be looking past you itâs not a good sign That shows that he is in a rush to escape the conversation
A lot of awkwardness can be avoided if you can find a good time to talk to your crush A good time to start a conversation could be before school during lunch or a break or after school or after an event is over Use down time as an opportunity to start a conversation A good place to talk could be at a bus stop in a bus or on public transit in a lunchroom at a dance or at a get together   Make sure you have enough time for at least a few minutes of conversation There are some down time periods that are too short for a conversation An example of a bad time to talk to someone would be if class is about to start This is probably not a great time to try to have a conversation because you will be interrupted and will feel silly that you tried to start a conversation at that time Avoid trying to start a conversation in a line or during a passing period Think about the way your schedule and your crushesâ schedule overlaps Plan on starting a conversation when both of you are free Are there any events that are coming up Think about if there are any dances parties or school events that are coming up that you can start a conversation with him or her at   One way that conversations can become awkward is when one person is extra stiff with the other person treating him or her like a stranger Instead treat your crush as though you are already friendly with him or her Even though it may be true that you do not know your crush well you should still talk to him or her with warmth and a friendly tone You can even start a conversation with an introduction while using a tone of familiarity and warmth by saying something like âHi I donât know if we have actually met Iâm Tim howâs it goingâ   When you are talking to your friends try to notice your tone of voice the hand gestures you use and the kind of expressions you use When you are talking with your crush try to be the same kind of natural and relaxed while you talk Donât be overly familiar with him or her as though you have a history you do not have For example you wouldnât say âHey dude Howâs itâ   If you are familiar with your crushes interests life friends likes dislikes etc use that knowledge to your advantage You donât have to focus on those things in particular when you talk but you can talk about things related to his or her interests For example if you know that he or she loves the beach you can talk about the surfing you have done recently And you donât have to mention that you know that the person likes the beach Just talk about it like you would talk to a friend who loves the beach   Awkward conversation can happen when you pretend like you know more about the person than you do in the same way that it can become awkward when you act like you donât know anything about himher at all when that is not true   This is an easy way to feel confident in yourself and avoid awkwardness Buy a pack of sugarless gum with xylitol to take with you to school or wherever you meet your crush Sugarless gum will cause your mouth to make saliva which will in turn make your breath better and make it easier for you to talk Pop a piece in your mouth 5 minutes after a meal and a few minutes before you talk with your crush If you are going to a dance or somewhere you might be up close and personal with him or her you can gargle with a mouth wash after you brush your teeth to freshen your breath Avoid eating food that will make your breath smell like onions and garlic Drink a glass of water this will flush out any of the food and bacteria that make for bad breath Use your comment as an icebreaker to start the conversation Look around and observe what is going on around you Is there anything funny or interesting that you notice For example if it is lunch and the food truck hasnât arrived yet you can say âAre they going to get us water for this wait or do they want us to dieâ If you are going to remark on something simple try to make it playful Even if you donât think of yourself as a funny person you can still be playful And playfulness is found to be very attractive to both guys and girls This playfulness will make the conversation fun and will help keep the mood light   Donât worry the first few comments you make to your crush are not going to make or break the conversation Getting the conversation started is more important So donât worry too much about being smooth and focus instead on continuing conversation   Once you have broken in with an opening line move on into something you can talk about more Asking for an update is a good question to ask if you do already know the person a little bit or you are taking a class together for example It is good idea to acknowledge your familiarity with one another by talking about the thing you have in common This will make the conversation less awkward and you will also get a better understanding of what is going on with the other person in your shared thing For example if you are taking a class together you can say âSo how is your midterm paper coming togetherâ   You donât have to mention the fact that you are in a class together unless you arenât sure that he or she knows If you want to remind him or her do it without making a big deal out of it Say âSo in English class how is your midterm paper coming togetherâ It is not weird that you know that you share a class If he or she doesnât know you mentioning the class first will tip him or her off and he or she will probably apologize for not recognizing you   Topics of conversation can go by pretty quickly and so it can be good to have a couple of open ended and easy to answer questions lined up to ask your crush You can start by telling him or her something that you do or know and then ask his or her opinion on it This question can also be related to the context of where you are or what you are doing For example if you are eating an apple at lunch you could say âI personally know that Granny Smith apples are the best apples in the world but out of curiosity what kind of apple is your favoriteâ Once again being playful is a good way to make your conversation less awkward and more fun especially when you are talking about simple topics and just getting your conversation going   You donât want to ask him or her something too controversial Stay away from any hot button topics like politics or religion  You should try to make a unique connection based on your conversation and the particular person you are talking to You can ask your crush something unusual but fun For example you could ask him or her something like âIs there a celebrity that people say or you think that you look likeâ This kind of question could make him or her laugh Once he or she tells you his or her celebrity look alike you can say whether you agree or disagree and you can tell him or her who your celebrity look alike is and you can lie as a joke   Avoid small talk or getting to know you questions You donât want to ask questions like âSo where are you fromâ because you will get an answer he or she has already used many times before This kind of playful conversation helps you get more comfortable with one another   If you donât have many opportunities to talk to your crush and you see a good one even if you donât have everything mapped out you may want to seize the opportunity to talk to him or her by just going for it Part of having a crush will always involve some amount of awkwardness and that can be part of the fun So you donât have to overthink it go for it   Going for it is good because it will help you get over the barrier of initial contact And remember it isnât very important how you start talking to him or her the important part is continuing the conversation Sometimes just going with your gut can bring out your most confident self   Once you have established a good connection with your crush you should start trying to get to know him or her better Start with something that he or she has mentioned or that you have observed in your interactions For example âI see you have some books with you what are you readingâ This is a low pressure question that lets your crush know you are interested in him or her Then ask follow up questions   For example if he or she is excited to talk about the books ask more questionsmake connections related to the books For example âThat is cool that you are reading that book My favorite book by that author is blankâ Or if he or she doesnt seem too excited about his or her books you can move onto something else more open ended Say something like âSo what else are you up to this weekâ Avoid bring up topics of conversation that show that you already know about your crushesâ interests because that might make you feel awkward For example if you know he plays soccer avoid bringing that up directly Donât say âSo tell me about your soccer seasonâ Instead let the conversation get there naturally   Your crush will enjoy himherself in a conversation with you much more if you are a good listener Once you have started conversation you should be face to face or in a listening position where you hear and see his or her face easily Another key part of active listening is making consistent but not constant eye contact during your conversation   Avoid distractions Donât send a text or look at your phone while you talk This will make it seem like you are disinterested and might keep you from really hearing what your crush is sayingRepeat the main idea of what your crush is saying This will let him or her know that you are listening and will give him or her the chance to clarify anything Repeat the most meaningful parts of what he or she is saying For example you can say âSo are you saying that you are new to painting but it feels like you have been doing it foreverâ This will help him or her feel connected to you because you show that you understand important things about him or her Avoid interrupting him or her in conversation It is easy to get excited by what we want to say and interrupt during his or her turn in the conversation But resist the temptation and wait until he or she has finished talking and then show your enthusiasm for what he or she is saying Be empathetic If your crush talks about something hard that is going on with him or her make sure you donât skip over his or her feelings in the conversation You could say in response to him or her talking about failing a test something like âI could understand why it would be really frustrating to have to retake that testâ   One way to keep a conversation friendly and natural is if you seem like you are having a good time talking with him or her A few ways you can show this if you make eye contact smile often laugh lean forward slightly when you are talking and use open body language Use any gestures when you talk that are natural for you and keep your arms open and not crossed   Tilting your head to one side is another good way to show friendlinessplayfulness when you are talking and flirting  This is good to do around the three quarter point into your conversation It is a good idea to suggest getting together or getting his or her number after you have made solid connections and before the conversation has become tired or worn out Think about a couple of activities that would be right for you both before you have a conversation Say something like âYou are really cool would you want to hang out sometimeâ Then suggest a couple of things you can do together and get his or her number   Or if you want to play it safer you can simply ask âHey can I have your number I have really enjoyed talking to youâ If you feel like the conversation was just okay you can always wait for a couple more conversations through texting or in person before asking to him or her to hang out   You might want to talk to your crush about something he or she talked about at the beginning of the conversation For example you can say âSo how much longer do you think you need to spend on your midterm paperâ And then spend the rest of the conversation finishing talking about the points of conversation you have already started   You can make inside jokes about what you talked about For example you can say âWell now that we have made it through this lunch period without water I suppose we can get through anything togetherâ Making inside jokes can help you cement connections you have made and it is a good way to make your connection last past the first conversation   When you are feeling good and you have just finished laughing about something you should politely end your conversation so that your crush is left with a good impression Make sure to tell him or her that you enjoyed your conversation   You can keep the end of your conversation casual You can say something like âI should be getting home now but I had a lot of fun talking to youâ If you are going to be seeing your crush in the future you should say something about seeing him or her again Say âI look forward to seeing you in class and hearing how your paper turned outâ Send a follow up text in the next couple of days saying hello and checking in with him or her about the things you talked about
Itâs possible that your girlfriend is mad at you but itâs also possible that sheâs going through something tough that has nothing to do with you Either way if you are getting negative feelings from her donât push her to talk right away Give her some time to cool down This will also give you time to think through your own feelings  Has your girlfriendâs behaviour actually changed toward you Is it possible that youâre feeling depressed or anxious about something and that youâre imagining that her behaviour is worse than normal   Itâs possible that she has always been a bit cold toward you but that as the relationship gets older you are realizing that you donât like the way she behaves Have you been through anything difficult recently Maybe youâve been demanding more attention from her lately and sheâs having a hard time meeting your needs which has resulted in her pulling away   She may be ignoring you but if sheâs struggling with depression she might not even realize it   Signs of depression include difficulties concentrating and making decisions fatigue feelings of helplessness hopelessness andor worthlessness insomnia or excessive sleeping irritability loss of interest in pleasurable activities such as sex or date nights overeating or loss of appetite anxiety suicidal thoughts andor destructive behaviourIf you think your girlfriend might be depressed there are things that you can do to help   As tempting as it may be to ignore her back or try to make her jealous itâs not healthy or productive to do so In addition if your girlfriend is depressed or struggling with some other difficult personal problem ignoring her back will only make things harder for her and could really damage your relationship   The âElastic Band Theoryâ suggests that you can make someone want you by pulling away from them It may work for some people in the short term but it is not the type of behaviour that you can build a healthy relationship onOne piece of positive advice that you can take from the âElastic Band Theoryâ is that people in relationships need space to do their own thing otherwise they will tire of one another or begin to take one another for granted You can take time for yourself and still be kind and respectful to your girlfriend Donât ignore her but do make sure that you have a life outside of her   Try not to dwell on how hurtupset your girlfriendâs behaviour is making you feel Remind yourself that she canât actually âmakeâ you feel anything and that you have a choice you can choose to acknowledge that youâre upset but to not let it hold you back from enjoying life   Do things that make you feel good visit with friends go to the gym pick up hobbies for example playing guitar making movies or hiking   If your girlfriend is completely ignoring you you might not be able to get in touch with her via phone or in person If you know she is still getting your texts you might try sending her a message that expresses your concern and asks her to meet up and talk   Example âYou havenât been responding to my texts lately When that happens I feel hurt and wonder if youâre still happy in our relationship Can we meet up and talkâ  If you know her schedule you might even suggest a day and time when she is usually free which could make it easier to get her to commit to meeting up     Skip this step if your girlfriend responds to you via text or phone If you canât get in touch with her via text or phone but you know that she is still okay ie hanging out with friends posting to social media you might try sending her a message that lays out your feelings and concerns via her Facebook inbox or an email address   If you choose to send an emailprivate message be sensitive to your tone Write a draft then reread it after youâve had a good nightâs sleep Make sure that it isnt mean or disrespectful Be specific Provide concrete examples of what she does and how you feel Be sure to word it in a way that isnât accusatory  âWhen we were at that party on Saturday you spent the whole night talking to other people We didnt get a chance to talk at all and you left without saying goodbye even though we were sitting across from each other in the same room When you did that I felt hurt I wasnât sure if I had done something wrong I am worried about you and I am worried about us I would like to get together in person and talk this through Or if youâre uncomfortable with that I am also open to communicating via email for nowâ   Before sending your email try to put yourself in her shoes as you give it a final read Think about how it might sound to her and how she might react and edit it to ensure that you are sharing your thoughts and feelings in the most effective way possible If she understands your side and doesnât feel threatened sheâs more likely to respond   If you manage to meet up with her in person to talk use empathetic body language This will show her that youâre committed to understanding her side of the story and it should encourage her to open up   Empathetic body language includes facing the person in an open position ie not crossing your arms or hunching over or turning away nodding and using eye contact to signal that you hear what sheâs saying and making reassuring sounds to show understanding without interrupting In nonviolent communication you focus on your own thoughts and feelings rather than accusing the other person of doing something wrong   Organize what you say in the following order observations feelings needs and requestsExample âFor the past week youâve not answered my calls and youâve cancelled our plans twice Iâm starting to worry that youâre not interested in having a relationship with me any moreâ   After youâve expressed how you feel let her know that you are open to communication and encourage her to share her feelings   Example âFor the past week youâve not answered my calls and youâve cancelled our plans twice Iâm starting to worry that youâre not interested in having a relationship with me any more I would like it if we could have a conversation about our relationship If itâs not our relationship thatâs the problem then I would like it if you could open up to me about what else is going onâ   If she admits that sheâs unhappy in some way ask her what she needswhat you can do She might need space or maybe she wants you to do something youâre not doing â it might even be something simple like hugging her more often or telling her sheâs beautiful   If she asks for space donât panic Again this could be completely about her and really have nothing to do with you  Ask her if she knows how long she might need If she says she doesnt know suggest a time that feels okay to you â perhaps a week Be supportive Ask her if thereâs anything you can do â for example call at the end of the week to check in If you decide to give each other space ensure that you are both clear on what that means For some space might just mean only talking on the phone twice a week instead of every night or it might mean an entire week without any communication whatsoever Clarifying what âspaceâ means to you will help make that time easier   Know that you donât HAVE to give her what she says she needs If you arenât comfortable with something that she requests itâs okay to tell her that The two of you might be able to make a compromise Ultimately the two of you need to respect one anotherâs needs and boundaries   When itâs her turn to speak actively listen to her This involves empathetic body language open stance nodding reassuring sounds as well as showing your understanding by repeating what she has said andor asking for clarificationIf you are hurt by something that she says itâs okay to let her know that but try to let her know in a nonconfrontational way   Example âThank you for opening up to me When you said that Iâm too clingy I felt sad and a bit confused I enjoy spending time with you but Iâm also happy to do my own thing I would like to know some of the specific things I do that lead you to think that Iâm clingy Maybe Iâll be able to change some of those thingsâ  If she can give you some specific examples even if you donât agree with them it will help you get a better sense of what she wants from the relationship Knowing what she wants will give you a clearer idea of whether youâre able or willing to give it to her   Donât roll your eyes or interrupt her while she is talking Let her get it all out before you respond What she has to say might be upsetting for you to hear you might not agree but just let her get it all out before you respond   Once youâve worked out what some of the problems may be work together to figure out how you can resolve them   If sheâs said that sheâs ignoring you because she feels overwhelmed by how much attention you pay to her ask her to give you some specific examples of the things that you do that make her feel that way  Perhaps she doesnât like that you call her three times a day at breakfast lunch and dinner Maybe you can agree to a âgood morningâ text and a short phone call after dinner every day     Sometimes itâs better to take a break when emotions are heated and to return to an argument later especially if youâve already been arguing for several hoursIf you find that youâre going in circles and solving nothing itâs probably a good time to take a break Perhaps you canât meet up again for two days and you would rather get it all sorted now That desire is totally normal but it really wonât help either of you when youâre both too exhausted from arguing to even think clearly   Chances are if youâre worried about your girlfriend ignoring you you want to keep the relationship If itâs not a problem with your perception and itâs not something personal that sheâs struggling with and if sheâs really just ignoring you because sheâs mad at you you need to consider whether you want to be in a relationship with someone who would rather hurt you than tell you why theyâre upset
Once youve shown enough interest in the girl and have flirted enough to make her think she has a chance its time for a turnaround Slowly start talking about another girl whether its someone she knows or a random girl you keep calling my really good friend or this girl Ive known forever   Find a way to mention the girl every few minutes Dont do it every few seconds or it will be too annoying but make it sound like youre constantly thinking of the other girl Find ways to complement the other girl Without being too obnoxious say things like Shes like my favorite person or She can get any guy she wants Make the other girl feel inferior You can also make this person up If youre a good liar this other girl can be completely fictional Repeatedly say You should really meet her I think youd get along This will drive the other girl crazy   Instead of just going on and on about another girl in your life you should take the opportunity to talk about lots of other girls Just make yourself sound like a ladies man who hangs out with a ton of cute girls whenever and wherever   Mention a party you went to where there were so many amazing girls You can even say that you were one of the few guys there but that it was okay  youre used to it Talk about a fun weekend trip you took to the beach and mention how all the girls you were with were wearing the most ridiculous bikinis Just mention this one girl I was seeing after another Make it sound like you go on a ton of dates Just make sure not to sound gross or like a total player The girl will lose interest if you make yourself out to be too much of a Lothario   While youre talking to the girl about being with other girls your phone will be a great prop in making her jealous Keep your phone handy and check it from time to time and even be prepared to answer it   Check your phone from time to time and smile to yourself as if youve just received a naughty message from a girl Say Excuse me and smile as you type back something that may be equally naughty Have your phone ring once while youre talking to the girl Pick it up and say Hey how are you Can I call you back Dont overdo it and call the girl honey or baby over the phone Just make it clear that youre talking to another sexy lady from the tone of your voice Dont overuse the phone tactic A girls patience will quickly wear if you spend all of your time on your phone
A natural genuine carefree smile is the perfect way to let a girl know that you like being around her It will also let her know that youâre a happy person and since happiness can be contagious sheâll associate positive emotions with you If she returns your smile you can bet she feels comfortable around you This is a great way to gauge her interest level As you talk notice if she gives you any signs or hints that she likes you or if uses vaguely romantic language She could also show her interest in you by nodding frequently or repeating some of your phrases   To start a conversation you can ask her an openended question about class work or pop culture It could be something as simple as âwhat do you think about this bandâ or âhowâs your day goingâ Donât fret if the girl you like doesnât initiate a conversation with you If she likes you she may be too shy or nervous to do so Even if she seems like the most confident girl you know she may have had a bad experience in the past or simply may not be ready to approach you yet but will be receptive if you start the conversation first If youâre already friends starting a conversation will be easy In this case the most effective way to tell if she likes you is to pick up on body language cues or to see if she treats you differently than she does her other friends   If you like the girl put your best foot forward by remembering a few small details about the things she tells you Listen carefully to the things she says so that you will have them for future reference   For example if she tells you the name of her favorite band bring up one of the bandâs songs during your next chat Sheâll be impressed that you took notice If she wasnât already interested in you romantically she might start to reconsider once she sees how attentive you are Talking also provides another opportunity to observe her body language so watch for physical cues such as subtle touches   Only do this if you actually do like her and if you get the sense that she likes you back This is a blunt move which can seem daunting but if you like the girl and are fairly certain she might like you back a bold approach which could open the door to you asking her out on a date with the certainty that she likes you back   You can let her know youâre interested by saying something like âI really like having you as a friend but Iâd love to be more than friendsâ Donât tell her you like her if you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about her interest in you This can be hurtful and can sever her trust in you   If you like the girl but arenât sure if she likes you back you can test the waters by saying âIâve been hearing great things about this movie___ Would you like to come see it with meâ Keep the tone casual If she says yes youâll know sheâs interested If she says no you can change the conversation to something else   Back off if you get the sense that she actually doesnât like you or engage in a flirty banter if you sense there is mutual interest   If the girl you like objects to your romantic advances even when you thought she liked you back dont take it personally A good relationship starts with a strong mutual connection Moreover there are plenty of other girls who will be right for you   Trying to figure out whether a girl likes you can be allconsuming and distracting Overanalyzing her behavior may result in your becoming obsessed with simply winning her over rather than getting to know her as a person   Rather than investing tons of time in determining whether or not she likes you take opportunities every now and then to spend time with her and her friends Just make sure to make your intentions relatively clear via subtle flirting or else you may become permanently friendzoned
While dogs and cats have lived with humans for thousands of years capuchins are wild animals and not domestic pets As a result you should not hold them to the same standards as traditional pets expecting them to be tame and quietIf you want a quiet pet a capuchin might not be the right choice While capuchins might seem docile calm and friendly as infants they often become louder unpredictable and sometimes aggressive as adults  The more you know about capuchins the better you will be able to recognize what sort of behaviors or noises are normal and which ones might be an indication of a medical or emotional problemCapuchins communicate with each other or their human companions using calls and vocalizations which convey fear excitement happiness and other emotions Learn about their behavior in the wild and in captivity so you will be better able to interpret and understand these vocalizations   In the wild capuchins live in large noisy groups of 1035 primatesSince capuchins make noise in the wild it is unreasonable and unfair to expect them to be quiet or silent in captivity When kept in captivity they are often more content in pairs If your capuchinâs needs arenât being met they might become very loud Here are a few basic guidelines to keep in mindMake sure they have large spaces to exercise both indoors and outdoors Capuchins also need a lot of mental stimulation so provide them with toys and puzzles that you change out regularly so they are not bored and acting out Ensure they have a varied and balanced diet In addition to primate food offer them fresh fruit and vegetables nuts and seeds eggs and insects
This is disrespectful and for your soontobe ex it can feel like youre being evasive Have the decency to do it privately and in person   You might not realize it but there are benefits to ending a relationship in person For one thing it gives both people a chance to talk and reflect on the situation And even though it will be harder to do it will most likely lead to less drama which is a good thing  Things are never that simple Be prepared to discuss your relationship without pointing your finger   You can probably find bad things about your relationship that you contributed to if you really wanted In an effort to be fair and to not have your exgirlfriend feel like she is directly responsible for the end of the relationship be sure to mention the things that you could have changed to make the relationship better In some cases the blame will be solely on the other person In those situations its okay to tell it like it is If your girlfriend is cheating abusing drugs manipulative or increasingly disrespecting you you can lay the blame directly on her actions In most cases this can cause an argument so be prepared The upside is that youre being honest with both yourself and her why the relationship didnt work leaving you both with a better chance of finding lasting love later on Isnt that what you both want     If you dont want to be friends afterward dont leave the door open for that possibility Find a nice way to say it Instead of Oh yeah and I dont want to stay friends afterwards just so you know try something like You know that I care for you I just dont think it will be healthy for either of us to stay friends immediately after we break up Hopefully sometime down the road when weve both figured stuff out we can get to that place   Use discretion when telling mutual friends about your break up Bragging or gossiping could be very hurtful to someone who may already be in a fragile emotional state On top of that it could encourage your ex to sling some nasty rumors your way and generally cause some immature behavior   Tell your close friends but dont publicize your breakup to acquaintances or people you hardly know Its probably a good idea to tell your close friends what happened between you and your ex Its probably not such a great idea to start telling your entire social circle via Facebook or every girl in your school that you and your ex are history It just smacks of desperation   Being petty can be hard to define but it usually includes doing things that you wouldnt want your girlfriend to do with you if she were hypothetically breaking up with you This is called the golden rule Do unto others as you would have them do unto you Its a great rule   Dont cheat on your ex before you break up with them If something is simmering between you and another girl have the decency to wait a bit really think about your feelings and break up with your current girlfriend before you do anything with the other girl It will look better to your ex and feel better for you Dont treat them poorly before the relationship has ended Better yet dont treat them poorly at all If youre still in a relationship you owe something to the other person Its not really okay to check out before things have ended If you dont feel like being nice to your girlfriend you owe it to her to give her the opportunity to find someone who can   There is no way around the fact that this is going to hurt the other person Its just like ripping off a bandage â if you rip it off all in one go the pain will be over quickly but if you do it slowly it will hurt for longer You can help minimize the heartbreak in a couple of ways   Dont be distant Even if you dont really feel like it offer hugs and other appropriate signs of affection if your ex looks like she needs it Be reassuring not selfish Find the right time to break up Obviously theres never a perfect time But right before a celebration test or vacation is a bad time to do it Give yourself enough time and try to do it when she doesnt have anything else significant going on afterward Resist the urge to argue When someone is being broken up with theres a good chance theyre going to be angry Dont feed her anger by provoking debating or belittling her Exlovers often say very hurtful things when they argue   When you finally break up you have to be prepared for anything It could be sadness anger or even a lack of emotion Its okay to feel any and all of these emotions during a breakup If you feel like showing emotion dont hold back If the emotion isnt there for whatever reason dont force it   Its the least that she deserves If you cant come up with a legitimate reason for why youre no longer interested in the relationship try thinking it over talk with a friend It doesnt have to be perfect but it should be legitimate You owe it to her   Show her that youve given it some thought and offer her some facts to back it up Dont be aggressive or combative When explaining the reasons for a breakup dont talk about other relationships Your relationship is your own and breaking up isnt about comparing your relationship to anyone elses Stay there for as long as she needs an explanation Dont run out the door as soon as youve said the words lets break up Stay with her while shes processing the information answering any followup questions she may have If you keep returning to the same questions over and over again tell her that you think thats happening   If its appropriate let her know why you think that shell make an excellent girlfriend for someone else sometime down the road Talk about the aspects of her personality that attracted you to her in the beginning and the traits of hers that stayed strong during the relationship This way she wont feel as horrible it could do something good for her confidence which will probably be shaken by the breakup   Unless youve decided that its absolutely the best to not talk after the breakup give her the option of discussing things when the situation is a little more calm This will give you both time to think and may help her feel like she is also given a chance to get things off her chest

Whenever your crush is around look at your BFF and see if she is comfortable with your crush being there or if she is looking all plastic and hurt deep inside Most girls are good actresses so you really have to take a closer look Can she look straight in the eye at your crush Can she still talk about normal things like your other friends do Does she stay with you there when your other friends leave or does she make the first exit  Talk about things that hes gone through like competitions hes joined or whatever See if she knows those stuff and if the way she says it is a bit possessive If she speaks too brightly then that would be a very bad sign If she doesnt speak at all or looks like shes not interested in the topic that might mean something as well Each person is different and reacts differently so you have to know for yourself what each action means for your BFF   If youre in High School then you might as well talk about prom sometime just make sure the timing is perfect and not like your topic just came out of the blue That would be suspicious Ask each of your friends who would they like to go to prom with and NEVER ask your BFF last that would make things more obvious and suspicious Maybe you could ask her first since shes your best friend If she says shes not interested in any of the guys or if she decides to go with the last guy you could ever think of then that means she is interested in someone   When you girls are alone doing a project or an assignment you ask her who shes interested in If she says theres none then probably she doesnt like to hurt your feelings because she likes your crush Its impossible not to be interested in someone especially in High School   Talk about the things you like nowadays books musicsetc If she is saying that she likes what your crush likes then that is a very bad sign It clearly shows that shes desperate to be noticed by your crush and not you If she compliments about your crush a lot and you dont want your crush to like your friend then just keep cool Dont say bad things about your friend to your crush or else hell think that youre a basic loser   If she or he is posting something on Instagram Tumblr Twitter Google Pinterest or Facebook about your crush or has uploadedtaggedliked etc a picture of your crush then its quite possible that your best friend likes your crush This can be one of the things that go to make up the whole picture   If your crush is online on Skype or social media apps see whether its possible for you to tell that theyre both online at the same time while your best friend is ignoring your repeated pings to talk This will tell you that your best friend isnt busy but might well be talking to your crush   Simply say Hey do you like X If your best friend blushes finds it hard to make eye contact with you says something like Phfff no or changes the subject this might be the clincher   If you ask your best friend via social media it will be harder to know whether your friend is covering up or not But shehe will still say no   When it becomes clear to you tell your best friend that youve noticed that he or she has feelings for your crush   If your best friend isnt already aware that this person is also your crush try to clarify that you also like this person and that you think you two need to work out together what happens next If your best friend does already know this is a bit tougher because its something that has happened despite knowing your own interests In this case tread carefully but youll still need to sort out what happens next See How to deal with your best friend dating your crush for more help

Donât worry about imperfections Remember everybody has some Instead of worrying needlessly about hiding this or that feature focus instead on showing selfconfidence through your body language So fix yourself up and dress according to your own style instead of trying to forcefit yourself into a âtypeâ that you think your crush might like betterPeople are far more likely to respond to your selfconfidence than your appearance Focus less on what your face and body look like and more on how you carry yourself   Try not to fidget or act jumpy Avoid nervous behavior like tapping your feet or fingers or playing with your hair ear or anything else Whether youâre standing or sitting remain composed Only move when itâs called for Show you own the room by not acting like youâre ready to flee at the drop of a hatKeep your feet from tapping or your knees from bouncing by concentrating on keeping both feet flat on the floor Use your hands to make gestures if thatâs what you normally do Just try to keep it to a minimum and be graceful about it so your special someone isnât distracted by wild flailing If you feel like some part of you absolutely must move focus your attention on your breathing Breathe deeply and concentrate on how your chest rises and falls   Avoid the temptation to stick your hands in your pockets Also fight the urge to cross arms Your crush might see these as signs of boredom anger or defensiveness Keep your arms hanging relaxed by your sides when standing or fold your hands over your lap if youâre sittingIf you find this hard bring something to hold when you talk to them to keep your hands occupied This could be anything from a textbook bag or even a pair of sneakers if youâre on your way to the gymIf you do bring a prop to hold just bring one Juggling a pile of random stuff might make you seem like a disorganized mess Resist the urge to fold in on yourself and hold yourself too tightly Instead show your confidence by setting your feet slightly apart from each other Aim your toes directly at your crush Show them that your attention is focused squarely on them Avoid creating the impression that youâre ready to bolt in some other directionDo the same if youâre seated facing each other If youâre seated side by side instead angle your feet slightly toward them Cross an ankle over one knee when youâre sitting if that feels more comfortable   Keep your back straight your shoulders down and your arms relaxed Stick your chest out a little Avoid hunching over or tensing your shoulders all the way up to your ears Whether youâre sitting standing still or walking stay relaxed move slowly and keep your back tall and proudThe key is to come off as relaxed so if you have bad posture in general start working on improving it when youâre alone If you arenât used to good posture you may come across as stiff and cranky if you force it Another exception would be if your crush is much shorter than you are In this case feel free to hunch forward to bring your heads closer together This way you wonât come across as staring down your nose at them
Relationships sometimes experience moments of doubt where one or both partners simply donât know what to do They may feel that âthings will get betterâ or that they should give their partner another chance but those second chances donât always work out  If youâre having doubts stop and think about them Think about whatâs causing the doubts and why theyâre bothering you Are your doubts uncalled for or reasonable Do you or your partner have a chance of overcoming these doubts Should you give your partner a second chance If you decide itâs time to end the relationship make sure you fully understand your reasons and are able to explain them to someone else Prepare yourself to talk about your reasons But also realize you donât have to justify your reasons  Breaking up with someone shouldnât be done on the spur of the moment But you also shouldnât try to avoid it because youâre scared of hurting your partner or youâre nervous about having the actual breakup conversation Once youâve had the time to think your reasons through and you know what youâre going to say itâs time to speak to your partner  Part of your preparation should also be to think about how your partner is going to react Think about your responses to their reactions so you donât have to struggle with what to say   No matter what location you choose it is kinder to do it in person Breaking up with someone via phone email or text is disrespectful and hurtful You wouldnât want someone to do that to you so donât do that to them You also need to consider how your partner is going to react to the breakup  You may want to choose a private location so you donât embarrass them if they get upset or angry You donât have to humiliate someone to break up with them Breaking up with someone is a personal process itâs not something you bring friends to If you feel you need the support afterwards make plans to meet up with your friends later If you have a longdistance relationship with someone and itâs impossible to get together in person to breakup using the phone or something like Skype is acceptable   Breaking up with someone isnât an opportunity to criticize every last annoying thing about that person Itâs okay to explain WHY you want to breakup but donât be harsh or brutal about it Be gentle and respectful Always remember to treat your partner like youâd want them to treat you  Let your partner know that they still matter to you and that theyâre still a great person List some of their awesome qualities to help boost their spirit Being honourable and respectful also means NOT spreading negative comments about your soontobe expartner behind their back   One thing to keep in mind when youâre breaking up with someone is that youâre prepared Youâve had the chance to think things through and come up with responses Youâve also had a chance to start processing your emotions Your partner hasnât To them the breakup could be sudden andor a shock As such donât assume itâs going to be a quick and easy process  Go into the conversation knowing you might need to listen to them plead beg complain get angry or even be relieved You canât walk away after youâve told them youâre breaking up you need to hear them out as well   Youâve broken up with this person now isnât the time to suddenly call email and text them all night Itâs entirely possible they may never want to talk to you again If you want to try to remain friends itâs worth a try but realize it might not work out Or it might not be the same type of friendship you had before you dated  After a few days consider sending them an email to ask if theyâre okay Or saying âHiâ to them in the hallway when you pass by Donât ignore them if you see them but you donât have to try to engage them if they ignore you   Who you share your feelings with is up to you but it should be someone you can trust to support you and keep your personal life private Hopefully you have a friend of family member whom you feel you can trust and you can speak to them about how you feel If not consider talking to a counsellor at school  This trusted and supportive person may be able to help out or they can provide you with advice on who can Whatever youâre going through realize you donât have to go through it alone   Crying gets a bad rap Thereâs nothing wrong with crying because you feel sad upset or even angry Crying can actually make you feel better because it releases stress hormones through tears  Allowing yourself to cry on your own terms will help prevent getting upset at an inopportune time like in the middle of class or a baseball game   Going through a breakup can be extremely stressful and emotionally draining You have enough to deal with on an emotional level you canât allow yourself to get physically unhealthy as well This means you need to remember to continue eating properly getting enough sleep and exercising regularly Taking care of yourself physically will help you get through your emotional trauma successfully   Once youâve had the chance to express your emotions initially keep yourself busy Continue to do the things you enjoy like reading going to a movie baking etc You might need to take a moment every now and again to have a good cry or get a hug from a friend but once thatâs over get back to being busy  Consider this as an opportunity to redecorate your room or learn how to play the guitar Focus your energy on something productive as often as you can   You arenât going to feel better instantly itâs going to take a little time before you get back to your ânormalâ self but thatâs okay Take the time you need donât rush yourself But do realize that you will feel better eventually These bad feelings will not last forever no matter how bad they feel Each person recovers from a breakup at different speeds  Donât compare your healing process to others you arenât them and they arenât you   No matter how the breakup happened whether youâre the one who initiated the breakup or someone broke up with you youâre still an awesome and lovable person Breakups happen for a whole number of reasons and they are almost never because of only one person Donât blame yourself for what happened and donât assume you deserve to feel badly  If you start thinking negatively take a moment to stop and think of all the awesome things about yourself Write them down if you have to Put sticky notes on your mirror to remind you how awesome you are As corny as it sounds it does help   Unfortunately some people get so bogged down in the emotion of a breakup that they look for unnatural ways to make themselves feel better And in some cases those unnatural ways can be drugs and alcohol This is obviously a dangerous thing to do and itâs not a road you want to go down If you notice yourself thinking about drugs or alcohol or you feel tempted to do things that are âout of the ordinaryâ for yourself get help  Donât be afraid to tell your parents friends or a trusted teacher that you need to talk to someone It is worth the effort to stop yourself before something truly destructive happens   Itâs no ones fault and no one did it on purpose but sometimes after a period of time both sides just realize they werenât meant for each other and itâs time to move on After getting to know someone you might start to realize they arenât the person you thought they were or that they donât share the same interests and values as you  Heartache can happen when one of the people realizes the relationship is over before the other Even if youâre the one who notices first and decides to call it off itâs still not your fault Youâre simply doing whatâs right for you and in the longrun whatâs right for both of you   Seeing someone from a distance or even knowing them as an acquaintance doesnât give you a lot of insight into who that person is Spending more time with them in a relationship sheds light on a lot of things you wouldnât have known about beforehand And sometimes these things you learn about the other person are not things you hoped for  You might find that the person you thought you could get along with wants to do nothing but argue with you or maybe theyâre too protective or overbearing It might have been impossible to know this before you starting dating   Probably one of the more painful reasons people breakup is because one of the people in the relationship finds themselves in love with another person Hopefully this person brokeup with their partner BEFORE they acted on their feelings for this other person but that doesnât always happen  If youâre the one who has fallen for someone else respect your existing partner enough to breakup with them BEFORE you cheat on them Itâs okay to fall for someone else but acting on those feeling while leading someone else on is dishonourable

Honesty is usually the best policy It is disrespectful to lie to someone If you dont want to date someone you should say soSometimes it is easy to be honest For example you might be able to truthfully say No thank you I already have a date for that party Other times you might need to find a kinder way to be nice Maybe you are not attracted to the person Instead of bluntly saying that try saying No thank you I just dont think we would be a good fit Avoid making up a phony excuse For instance dont tell someone you will be out of town this weekend if you wont be Theres a chance that you might then run into them at the movies which would definitely cause hurt feelings  A compliment sandwich is a really effective way to provide feedback Essentially you sandwich your negative comment between two positive things Try using this method when you need to reject someoneAn example of a compliment sandwich is to say something such as Youre an awesome person Unfortunately Im not interested in dating you Someone else is going to be really lucky to date someone with such a great personality You could also try You are a really nice person Im only interested you as a friend I like when we hang out in big groups together Be sincere If you offer false compliments the other person will likely be able to tell and feel hurt   If you do not want to date someone it is best to be upfront about your feelings Do not beat around the bush If your mind is made up it is best to clearly state your responseIf someone asks you to date them and you dont want to you can be direct and kind at the same time State your answer clearly You can make your feelings clear without purposefully hurting someone elses feelings Try smiling and saying That sounds fun but no thank you Im not interested in dating you Dont beat around the bush If you do not want to accept the date there is no need to say Let me think about it It is best to get the rejection over with You dont want to give someone false hope Avoid saying something like Let me check my schedule and get back to you   Try to treat the person the way you would want to be treated This means that you should choose your words carefully Be thoughtful in your responseIts okay to pause before responding You might be taken by surprise and need a moment to collect your thoughts Say thank you It is a compliment to be asked out You can say Im flattered Unfortunately I cant accept Dont laugh Many people laugh nervously in awkward situations Try to avoid giggling as that is likely to result in hurt feelings   Sometimes it is not what you say but how you say it If you need to reject someone think about factors other than your words Nonverbal communication matters tooUse the right tone of voice Try to sound gentle but firm Make eye contact This helps convey that you are being serious and also shows respect for the other person If you are in public try not to speak too loudly It is not necessary for everyone around you to know that you are turning down a date
Staring makes it obvious that youre checking a girl out Instead of keeping your eyes on her pretend like youre looking around the room naturally As youre moving your head and eyes around sneak looks at the girl that you want to check outFor instance if you notice her at a sporting event you can pretend to watch the game but steal looks at her instead If you share the same lunch period you can act like youre looking around the cafeteria or looking at your friends when youre really checking her out  Sunglasses will hide where youre looking and enable you to check out a girl without her thinking that youre looking directly at her If you want to use sunglasses make sure that you get ones with dark or reflective lenses so that she cant see your eyes If youre far enough away from the girl she wont be able to see your eyes or where youre looking If you dont want her to notice you wait for her to walk at least five feet 15 m away before turning to look at her  Dont follow the girl around just check her out when shes around you Dont do this repeatedly or she and her friends may think youre creepy   Instead of looking directly in the girls direction you can use your side vision or your peripheral vision to check them out You can practice this in your room by keeping your head straight and trying to look at things on the side of you Instead of turning your head or facing the girl look at her from the side Theres no reason why you need to stare at someone Instead just take a quick glance check her out and then look at something else If you check her out for too long it could come off as creepy and isnt a habit you want to get into

much time alone together Instead hang out with mutual friends Avoid physical contact which could stir old feelings If youâre trying to rekindle the flame with your ex you shouldnât try to be their friend You donât have to become best friends However youâll at least show your ex that youâve accepted their new significant other When you feel comfortable just smile or say âHiâ as you pass each other in the hall If theyâre with your ex when you hang out include them in conversations
If your guinea pig is losing weight its imperative that they see a vet Unless youve actually seen other guinea pigs blocking them from food and youre certain this is the only cause of loss get them checked by a vet to ensure there are no other problems   If the pecking order has changed and there is another bottom pig the previous lightest cavy may begin gaining weight while the new bottom pig loses  If the guinea pig is being bullied at veggie time chances are its happening with hay pellets and even water too   Have the same number of bowls hay racks and bottles as guinea pigs  even if bullying is terrible each pig can only hog one at once Space these evenly around the cage eg in opposite corners to that cavies cannot block access to all of them at once   Its awfully inconvenient to do this with any kind of temporary enclosure because youre going to have to set it up every single day or twice a day if you feed vegetables mornings and evenings Put this cage near to the main cage so that theyre still within earshot of the other guinea pigs   If youre only separating them for a short time such as 2030 minutes you can have a small cage with bedding and a bowl for vegetables If the separation is longer they will also need a water bottle and possibly a larger cage Add any other needs such as pellets and hay if youre also separating for equal access to those   Its easier to put separate vegetables on a smaller plate when youre preparing them rather than trying to divide it all up at the cage   If the guinea pigs access to veggies has been severely restricted their main problem will be vitamin C deficiency so focus on high vitamin C foods like capsicum bell peppers The guinea pig will likely be nervous at being put in a separate cage so include some of their favourite food to entice them to start eating Now is a good time to review How to Feed a Guinea Pig to make sure youre giving them a good diet   Its good to get all guinea pigs interested in dinner before you separate so give them a good look at the food and perhaps a tidbit each now   As gently as possible remove the guinea pig from the cage and place her in the separate cage   Place vegetables andor hay and pellets into each cage   Leave the guinea pigs for a while unless they are very comfortable eating around you   When you return check what the separated guinea pig has not eaten You can also check their cage for poops at this stage to ensure their digestion is working normally   If the guinea pig has been in the cage for half an hour they should have gone to the bathroom at least once in this time   There may be a small amount of rumbling among the cavies when they are reunited
Lick your lips so that they arenât too dry It will make him more likely to want to French kiss you if your lips look moist Use chap stick or lip balm Itâs probably best if you close your eyes for most of the kiss Itâs a little unnerving to most people if the person they are kissing is staring at them all of the time Open your lips while French kissingAngle your head to one side so that your noses donât bump into each other Itâs usually a good idea to start with other kisses rather than immediately French kissing him Never forget that youâre not the only one whoâs nervous or a little insecure He probably is too So if heâs not taking the hint but seems into kissing you you can initiative the French kiss yourself   Start by gently pushing the tip of your tongue into your partnerâs mouth in order to assess his interest If he doesnât pull away thatâs your signal Now find the tip of his tongue with your tongue Gently brush against it with your tongue Thatâs it Youâre French kissing   Once youâve started the French kiss by touching each otherâs tongues if both are receptive you can deepen the kiss   French kissing is very intimate and a way to bond with your boyfriend Simply move your tongue deeper into your partnerâs mouth to make more contact A good kiss is a long one in which both tongues are touchingThrust your tongue into his mouth with a little bit more forcefulness If heâs as passionate about you as you are with him he will likely move his tongue deeper into your mouth too touching your tongue with his
When youre just coming out of a situation that has caused you heartbreak like the breakup of a relationship youre going to need to give yourself time to grieve and to deal with all the emotions that are going to plague you in those first months   Dont immediately throw yourself into work or something else that consumes all your time because youll just keep pushing away the emotions rather than actually dealing with them and that will make it harder on you in the long run You are going to have lots of emotional ups and downs Recovering from heartbreak isnt a straight line of progression upward but rather a spiral Just remember as you are going through the same emotional circle that each time around youre better able to deal with the emotions from the heartbreak and that you are getting better  Its nearly impossible to get over the heartbreak of a relationship ending but constantly being bombarded with information about your ex is definitely not going to help anything This means no stalking on Facebook no texting no drunken phone callsBlock your ex on social media so that you wont be tempted to spend hours pouring over their Facebook page and overanalyzing every single thing they post in an attempt to figure out if they regret not being with you and miss you etc etc If youre constantly trying to stay in communication with your ex youre not going to be able to move on which will make your feelings of heartbreak and unhappiness that much harder and that much harder to bear   You are going to be devastated when you encounter heartbreak Theres no way to avoid that and if you fight those feelings youre going to make it harder to deal with them in the long run   Try journaling about how youre feeling This is an especially good thing to do if youre bad at talking with other people about your feelings Every day write down how youre feeling about the heartbreak Gradually youll see that you are getting better You dont need to pretend youre fine when youre really really not Accept that youre going to be going through some emotional turbulence for a bit Your friends if theyre true friends will understand and support you Feel free to listen to angsty angry sad songs to help get those feelings out but dont stay there Make sure that you dont only listen to songs about heartbreak and breakups otherwise youre going to have an even tougher time getting over it   While you will need time to wallow in your unhappiness you also need to remind yourself why life is worth living At first it will be really hard to make yourself go out and do anything but trying to do at least one thing a week can be a good place to start   Start small Dont try to make yourself go out and host an entire fancy dinner right after the heartbreak Instead start by getting coffee or a beer with your best friend or going to hang out at the library Do things that you enjoy especially things that you werent able to do while being part of a couple This will remind you why youre better off without the relationship and remind you how to do things on your own   One of the most important things to do while youre recovering from heartbreak is to take care of yourself A lot of times youll be feeling super unmotivated and it can be hard to simple get out of bed but going that extra mile for yourself can help you from falling into a huge pit of despair   Reward yourself for things that take extra effort like cleaning your apartment going grocery shopping even showering Exercising can be a good way to take care of yourself and boost your mood Exercise releases endorphins which can help make you feel happier and youll feel better about yourself in general   Once youve gotten over the initial shock of the heartbreak you need to make sure that you dont spend too much time wallowing and grieving otherwise youre never going to let yourself get over the relationship and thats what you need most of allSet a time each day to reflect on the breakup usually about 2030 minutes Set a timer so that you know when times up During the day as thoughts of the heartbreak come up remind yourself that you have a specific time set aside and until then youll focus on other things Make sure that you have an activity that requires your attention preferably something fun schedule for right after so your attention is immediately diverted Get a trusted friend or family member to help you out Give yourself a certain limit when talking about the heartbreak say 30 minutes and when youve gone over it have your friend or family member remind you to put your focus elsewhere   Theres nothing wrong with bolstering your confidence with an easy rebound relationship as long as both parties know thats all it is Youre going to be in a mire of low selfconfidence and vulnerability after a recent split and thats a really bad time to try to start something real with someone else   If youre going out and partying try to moderate your drinking both so that you dont end up drunkcallingtexting your ex and so that you dont think its a really good idea to try to start something with someone because youre feeling down and your self esteem is low Have your friends help you out If it looks like youre coming in for a fall have them remind you about rebounds and just make sure thats really what you want which it can be but youll need to check in with yourself to make sure   This also refers to texting and calling You really want to make sure that you dont post tons of angry or upset things about your former relationship and you dont want to invite everyone to witness your mental breakdown over Facebook status updates   You also want to make sure that youre not just putting things like cant wait for my hot date tonight on Facebook in the hopes that your ex or their friends will see If youre doing that youre still in the throes of the breakup and youre still doing things for their benefit instead your own The more you textcall your ex the harder it will be for you to move on especially if they broke up with you Youll be doing nothing more than boosting their self esteem and lowering your own Delete them from your phone block them on social media and dont ask your friends or their friends how they are   The heartbreak comes from the trauma of the end of a relationship and once youve moved on from the relationship itself youll be no longer experiencing the heartbreak Your goal is to remember that this is something that you are capable of even when it feels like your world has come to an endYou still have a future remember Even though it no longer involves that other person you still have hopes and dreams and plans for what youll be doing Youll be grieving the loss of the dreams you were working for with the other person but youll need to remember that you can replace those dreams with new ones Repeat to yourself I want to be happy This mantra will remind you that even though youre in the dumps because of heartbreak you have no desire to remain there Remind yourself that youre working towards being happy and getting over your heartbreak is part of that Sometimes you cant get over something on your own and you need to seek professional assistance There is nothing wrong with this or with you and you shouldnt feel ashamed about it Heartbreak is painful and it stirs up a whole bubbling cauldron of feelings and emotions that can be difficult to deal with   Learn to see the difference between regular sadness over a breakup and true depression If its been weeks and youre unable to get out of bed or take care of yourself or you simply dont care about anything you definitely need to see a professional
Seek out a mutual friend to better understand why your crush might hate you Sometimes your crush doesnât hate you at all and your perception is wrong   You could ask a friend by saying âIâd really like to get to know John better but I think he hates me Do you know if thereâs any truth to thatâ  Your crush might hate you because of a misunderstanding Clearing this up can bring you two closer together Letâs say you found out from your friend that your crush saw you in their open locker and this is the reason they hate you You could approach your crush and try to clear things upFor example you could say âHey I think you may dislike me because you believe I stole something out of your locker I wanted to let you know that the reason I was in your locker at all was because the school administrator thought no one was using it She opened it for me with a master key It was purely an accidentâ You could say âI totally understand why you might think that was a strange thing to see If I were you Iâd probably think so tooâ   If your crush has a real reason to have bad feelings towards you apologize to them to try to make things right Be genuine in your apology and try to say plainly that what you did was wrong Donât try to justify your actionsFor example if your crush hates you because you made fun of them in public you could say âHey Iâve had some time to think about that and I wanted to let you know how sorry I am That was not rightâ Another apology could go âIâm sorry I participated in that mean prank we pulled on you I really regret doing itâ   Find a good time to approach your crush when neither of you is busy By catching them at an opportune moment theyâre more likely to be receptive to conversation Make sure you pick a time when they are not busy working on something or engaged in conversation with someone elseIf you see your crush sitting on a bench you could say âHey mind if I sit with youâ or âItâs a beautiful day out isnât itâ   A smile makes you seem happy and open To appeal most to your crush flash them a smile to let them know youâre feeling friendly If you feel intimidated imagine your crush as an old friend to feel more at ease If youâre not sure what to say when you approach your crush try some easy phrases that can kick off any conversation These donât have to be particularly loaded or customized to your crush just break the ice   You could say âSo what are you up to this weekendâ or âHave you done anything fun latelyâ Other examples are âDo you know what the weatherâs supposed to be like this weekâ or âWhat was the highlight of your day todayâ If you and your crush have friends in common they can be a great source of conversation Try to incorporate your mutual friends in a group hangout or simply discuss how you got to know someone you are both close to You may discover new things in common   You could say âI met Damien in cross country because we both love running I think youâre friends with Damien too How did you guys meetâ or âSarah and I met at a poetry slam I think I saw you hanging out How do you guys know each otherâ   Itâs possible you and your crush already have certain activities like sports or classes in common To make for easy conversation try to draw on shared experiences at schoolFor example you could say âI thought school assembly was really funny on Tuesday What did you thinkâ or âDid you see the school soccer match Friday night It was really closeâ   Ask your crush thoughtful questions about their hobbies to engage them in a positive way It shows youâve been paying attention to the things that are important to them and are interested in getting to know them better   You could say âI noticed you play tennis Did you watch Wimbledon this yearâ or âI liked the cookies you brought in to homeroom Whatâs your favorite thing to bakeâ Do not engage your crush in a debate or argument which can feel badgering even if you like to do that with your friends Try to be your kindest most appealing self You can do this by paying an earnest compliment or exhibiting common kindnessFor example you could say âHey I really like that sweater It looks nice on youâ or âI bought an extra soda at the vending machine Would you like to have itâ
If you two havent met yet and this girl likes you then she may stare at you and smile to get your attention Make sure you smile back and watch her reaction Shy girls may blush and outgoing girls may smile back Youre basically engaging in a little flirting If she notices youre around and she likes you she may want to appear more interested in her friends so shell start laughing She may also feel nervous when youre around and many people giggle or laugh when theyre nervous Does her face turn red when around you She might stare at you for a long time and smile when you look Maybe when you look at her she looks quickly away These signs may mean she likes you She may also look nervous because she has butterflies meaning she likes you If you notice she seems to drop things when shes near you that could be a sign she likes you It could indicate she gets nervous when shes near you causing her to drop things or be a bit clumsier Your friends may have heard whether the person likes you or not Even if they havent theyll probably be better at guessing than you are Thats only because when its you in the situation you have a harder time stepping back and analyzing it and you may feel a little selfconscious thinking about a girl liking you Therefore asking a good friend can help you analyze the situation better One way to see if a girl likes you is to watch how she treats you on social media Of course you first need to friend her Once you do watch how she interacts with you If she seems to pay extra attention to you she may like you For instance maybe she likes everything you post or tags you in a number of her postsFor instance if she writes Cute on a selfie you posted it may be shes flirting with you   If a girl likes you shes going to find reasons to be near you Even if youve never talked to her youll look up and shell be at the next table in the library or a few benches down at the basketball game Its not that shes stalking you Rather shes probably hoping youll notice herThis approach may include things like walking through your line of sight or talking to people near you   If youre trying to figure out if someone likes you by analyzing everything she does she may not be that into you If someone likes you youll generally know it in your gut with the exception of very shy peopleHowever if youre not sure its always best to give it a shot by talking to her The worst she can say is No   If you notice that she seems to go up and talk to everyone but avoids talking to you she may just be nervous about talking to you In other words she doesnt talk to you because she likes you and that makes her scared Another step you could take is to talk to one of her friends particularly if you have a class with one of them A simple Hey youre Jesss friend right Can I ask you something Do you think Jess likes me is really all you need   You can also watch how her friends react when youre around the whole group of them including the girl you like For instance they may start whispering to each other teasing the girl or even pushing her in your direction   See if she wants to keep your attention or if her eyes move away from yours If she is consistently making eye contact and sometimes blushing while doing it chances are sheâs interested in you She may also try stealing quick glances at you when she thinks youre not looking   Of course you dont want to just stare at her because that will come off as creepy Just glance in her direction or try to hold her eyes for a couple of seconds However some girls are just shy and they may not want to make eye contact with you Try encouraging her with other steps   Smiling shows your interest and makes it easy for her to smile back at you Sometimes it might take a while for both of you to just make eye contact and smile before youâre ready to actually talk to each other Even if youâre nervous smiling is a good way to make contact because a smile actually acts as a reward to other people In other words when you smile at her her brain perceives it as a reward making her happier to be around you Donât just hang around with the same group of friends Itâs much easier to approach someone who is alone rather than someone whos with a large group so if you make sure youre alone sometime when shes around she might come over and talk to you You could also try and go alone to a place you know she will be to make yourself a little more available You never know what might happenFor instance maybe you notice she spends time at the library after school Make it a point to show up there too Try sitting at a table near her where she can see you   You donât have to do much more at first if youâre shy If sheâs unwilling to say âhiâ back she might not be interested Try it a few more times but if she never responds let it goYou might be nervous about approaching her but the only way you can really test your theory of whether she likes you or not is to actually talk to her   If sheâs responded to your greeting you can move ahead to actually talking to each other Consider what you know about her as that can lead to a conversation Is she part of the drama club or does she play sports Engaging with her about school activities is a great first way to make conversation You could even try to be funny but that can be hardYou could ask Is your training on the track team really hard or What did you think of the pep rally You could also say something like Wasnt the food gross in the cafeteria today Isnt it awful what they call food or Donât you think Mr Harrison looks and sounds a lot like Yoda   Now that you have some possible questions find a good time to talk to her It should be a time when neither of you is hurrying off to class or activities and hopefully when youâre both alone It can feel really awkward the first time but it does get easier If she really responds and starts asking you questions too chances are that she is interested in you If she doesnât really respond itâs likely sheâs not that into youFor example if you asked whether her track training was hard she might say Yes but I love it In that case you could say Cool What do you love about it Ive always thought about getting into running but it seems really hard
A modest amount of social media stalking is pretty standard when you start dating someone just keep it from getting creepy You can secretly look at every photo of them for the last four years without scaring them off but try to avoid making it obvious youre watching their every move Limit your comments and likes to one or two a week You should have better things to do even if you dont have better things to do   Desperate people often look to push the relationship too fast Dont bring up topics like marriage or even make too many references to future dates early in the relationship Desperate daters are often asking for continual status updates on the relationship and trying to push for more commitment in various ways Just let things happen and if you are right for each other it will work out in time Just because you start dating someone dont put aside your friends to spend all your time with him Anyone that drops all their friends for a new date will come off as very desperate You cant make yourself too available and you dont want to come off as clingy Staying true to yourself and your friends will set up healthy boundaries and expectations for a happy relationship   By holding on too tightly you can drive a love interest away If the guy is right for you and the relationship is going well he will stick around If it isnt meant to be no amount of clinging is going to make it happen Most of the time it isnt even the guy youre clinging to its the idea of needing a relationship
Put your saddle on a sawhorse saddle rack or something similar to hold it up while you clean it This keeps your saddle stable and easy to adjust while you clean   Once your saddle is stable remove any addons such as stirrups These should be cleaned separately  Getting loose dirt off before wetting your saddle makes the rest of the cleaning faster and easier Use a dry cloth to remove any loose dirt and dust before wetting your saddleAvoid grinding dirt into the saddle while dusting Use a gentle hand to swipe over the surface of the saddle Be sure to use a clean cloth or softbristled saddle brush with nothing on it   Dip a doublesided kitchen sponge into a bucket of warm water Gently wring it out and lather it up with saddle soap   Be sure the sponge is damp enough to create your lather but not dripping wet Excess water may cause the leather to dry slowly and could lead to warping or distortion You can also use a loofah glove to apply and lather the saddle soap Loofah gloves make cleaning stirrups and reins easier   Place the soaped sponge on the saddle and rub vigorously in small circular motions Cover the entire smooth leather surface of the saddle including the underside and beneath flapsAvoid suede specialty leathers or rough areas of the saddle Rinse out your sponge and relather it with soap any time the sponge starts to dry or becomes too dirty   Use a clean damp sponge or a damp towel to wipe off any excess soap Rinse the sponge or towel and repeat until all soap residue is gone    Pay close attention to folds and seams on your saddle Use a toothbrush or cotton swab to remove soap residue from tight areas   Use a dry towel to wipe away any excess water Then allow your saddle to dry naturally before conditioning   Keep your saddle out of direct sunlight while it drys and do not apply any direct heat such as a blow dryer Let your saddle dry most of the way before conditioning but try to condition before it is completely dry You do not want your saddle to feel moist when you condition but it should still be cool to the touch   Use a soft towel to apply a light layer of conditioner or oil over the entirety of the saddle Allow the conditioner to absorb into the saddle for one hourUse a purposemade leather conditioning cream or neatsfoot oil to condition the saddle Avoid products that are petroleumbased as they could dry out the leather Reapply oil or cream to your towel as necessary to ensure even coverage Uneven coverage may cause discoloration   If your saddle has any rawhide elements condition them separately Use a conditioning cream meant especially for rawhide   If you are unsure of what conditioner to use on each part of your saddle itâs best to ask someone at your barn or the tack store Using the wrong conditioner can cause your saddle to dry out or become deteriorated distorted or discolored   Use a soft dry towel to remove any excess oil or cream Then buff your saddle with a smooth cloth to give it a nice finish   Once your saddle has been buffed it is clean and ready for use   How often you need to clean your saddle will depend on how often you ride as well as the type of riding you do Make sure your saddle is getting cleaned regularly but not so much that it dries out or damages the leather   If you ride daily you may need to clean your saddle every two to three months If you ride once a week or less your saddle may only require cleaning twice a year If you ride in environments where the saddle is frequently exposed to dirt mud salt or sweat you will want to clean your saddle whenever it gets noticeably dirty or starts to feel brittle If you are about to store your saddle for a long stretch such as a full season clean and condition it before you store   Every leather is a little different and saddles differ from maker to maker That is why it is a good idea to check with your saddleâs manufacturer to see what they recommend for your particular saddleCheck any printed materials that your manufacturer may have provided to look for recommended products as well as products that might damage the leather If you are unsure about a product call the manufacturer directly to ask âWill this damage your leather saddlesâ   Your saddle should be conditioned soon after it is cleaned Make sure you have everything you need to fully clean and moisturize your saddle You will need   A bucket of water Towels Sponges A bristle brush Saddle soap Leather Cleaner Leather conditioner or neatsfoot oil
If the dude keeps messaging you on Instagram or sending you romantic Snapchats that you donât really want fix the problem at the source by removing him from your friendsâ lists   Check your privacy settings to make sure he canât see any of your activity or send you messages after you block him Be prepared that removing him from your social media accounts may hurt his feelings Use this as a last resort If a guy just wonât leave you alone itâs time to talk to someone First of all consider talking to him directly If the problem doesnât subside after a while you should probably reach out to an adult   Stalking is a serious offense and its more common in high school than youd think Your high school counselor or a trusted teacher can help you handle the guy and keep you safe   Itâs easy to dwell on a situation like this especially if youâre afraid youâve hurt the guyâs feelings But try your best not to After heâs finally gotten the hint rejoice in your freedom Then let go for the good of your mental healthTry not to talk negatively about the guy during the situation or after That wonât make you feel any better and itâs a drain on everyone else
It does no one any good if you act out against girls because youâre angry at all women or blame them for your problems You are the person in charge of your life and you have to own that No one is responsible for your actions but you and this can be a freeing thought because if you decide the ladies arenât for you itâs entirely your choice   No one can tell you that youâre wrong Be kind and gentlemanly to women even if youâve decided that dating isnât for you at the moment  Making the choice to get away from girls even for a while has a certain gravity and you may find that you gain a certain monastic clarity by giving up on the ladies If you decide youâre fed up with the dating game quit playing it Making a clean break will help you gain perspective and give you a new and refreshing outlook on life   It may be difficult but when you find yourself getting hung up on those same negative thoughts about girls or a girl remind yourself that itâs just not worth it   Youâll get nowhere by holding grudges even if a girl left you for someone else or you feel that you were led on or had your heart stomped on When you hold on to anger it does no one any good especially not you Decide that youâll be single for positive reasons not negative ones Focus on the positive aspects of being single rather than the negative experiences you may have had with girls   Give it time When you experience heartbreak the only thing that can really make it better is time
If your boyfriend wonât stop touching you after youâve talked to him this is a serious problem and a huge lack of respect on his part Any touching in a relationship must be agreed to by both people At this point you need to get distance from him Get up and walk away If he asks what you are doing you could say âI told you to stop and you didnât listen Iâm out of hereâ and walk out the door Donât stick around to argue about it You donât owe him an explanation He owes you a huge apology If your boyfriend has disrespected you and refused to stop touching you it is time to involve an adult that you trust You could tell a parent older sibling teacher coach religious leader or counselor If this happened at school the boy should be suspendedIf it happened outside of school the boyâs parents need to be involved If he went even further than touching law enforcement agencies may need to be involved Make sure to reach out for help It is not your job to deal with this alone The fault is solely on the boy who mistreated you none of it is your faultIf you arenât sure how to start the conversation find a time alone with the adult and say âCould we talk about something Iâve been having problems in a relationshipâ Then tell the adult what happened and ask for help You could say âMy boyfriend started touching me in a way I was uncomfortable with and when I asked him to stop he wouldnât listenâ   Any guy who doesnt respect your wishes doesnt deserve you You dont even need to say anything just leave him out in the cold If you want to say something you could tell him âThis is over because you disrespected me and I wonât stand for that Byeâ Its his own fault he had several chances to stop and you should never be with someone who doesnt listen to youIf you stick with him and dont deal with it now you will have problems in the relationship later and will continue to be mistreated Find someone who respects and cherishes you and donât settle for anyone who doesnât   Donât ever try to rationalize someone elseâs inappropriate behavior If you feel at all uncomfortable you need to acknowledge that and take immediate actions to stop what is happening You never need to feel embarrassed or ashamed if someone is making you uncomfortable Instead listen to how you feel and confront the person You can simply say âYouâre making me uncomfortable Please stopâ
You may be angry and you have every right to be However especially if you are alone swearing yelling or otherwise venting your anger could provoke an unstable assailant to attack you Take deep breaths tell yourself this person does not matter to me and get away as soon as you can Someone who has previously stalked you or crossed your boundaries may claim to have reformed They may call and write you emails begging for a response or for the chance to see you one last time just to apologize Refuse this as they may be plotting something worse If they really wanted to make it up to you they would leave you aloneDo not reply to any correspondence if you are being stalked Make sure to save the texts or missed calls as they will be evidence if the situation continues to worsen   Save any letters emails voicemails or other correspondence you receive from your aggressor Take notes after any interactions noting the time place and what was said and done Photograph any alterations to your physical environment such as roses left on your doorstep broken windows or creepy notes If you need to build an HR case or a case for a restraining order this will be of great help  Predators sometimes resort to spiking drinks with drugs to render victims disoriented and amenable If you are at a bar or other social event and someone offers you an open drink especially someone who hit on you refuse it If you feel unsafe refusing it take it politely and dispose of it discretelyWatch your glass If anyone passes a hand over it dont drink it If you feel disoriented cant remember how you got from one point to another or are otherwise feeling confused while out on the town get your friends to take you home immediately Dont let a stranger help you Ask for help from a bartender a friend or a family member   Go out with people you trust and make a plan for the evening Stay in touch throughout the night and make sure you have a point person in charge of getting everyone safely home   It can be hard for drunk people especially those who have been drugged to communicate what they want or need Some people might end up in dangerous situations that look consensual Make sure you or your groups point person checks in with anyone who is going home with a stranger
Itâs a simple first step but itâs an important one Your crush cant know you if you never talk to them If youre not comfortable with talking to your crush saying hi is a good way to break the ice and build your confidence This will make it easier to talk to them in the future  Once youâve gotten used to saying âhiâ it will be easier for you to engage your crush casually Keep it simple and light early on showing an interest but without getting too personal   Ask how their day is going Talk to them about the latest events happening in your town or at school Ask them how any school activities they participate in are going How did football practice go today Whens the next event for the Debate Club Ask what they like to do in their spare time and ask followup questions about that Getting to know your crushs interest is a great way to both learn more about him and make him feel appreciated For example almost everyone likes music What kind of music do you like is a great icebreaker   Once youâre comfortable enough to talk to your crush donât forget to incorporate body language Eighty per cent of human communication is nonverbal Doing these things can help indicate your interest   Smile at your crush when they look at you This shows youâre happy to see them and will engender good feelings in them about seeing you in return Meet your crush with uncrossed arms and a gaze upward dont look down at your shoes or phone This shows your availability to being approached Make eye contact Eye contact is a great way to both show your crush has your attention and to establish intimacyLean closer when you talk to them This indicates both an interest in what they are saying and will over time make them more comfortable with sharing space with you Brush their arm or lightly touch them occasionally as you talk Making someone comfortable with physical contact with you is a great way to build intimacy It also shows youre comfortable with themGenerally this is a better approach if you are a woman and your crush is a man but it can still work if your crush is comfortable with you doing this   You donât want to overdo this or it comes across as flattery but try to remember it when you see them Everybody likes to feel appreciated and like many of the other techniques described here this will grow positive feelings in them about seeing you In particular if they shows up looking different in some way compliment that I like your new haircut Is that a new outfit It looks great on you If youâve been talking to your crush a bit and know more about their activities and hobbies you can find ways to compliment them on their efforts there as well The more genuine you can be the better If say your crush is an athlete watch them practice or compete and compliment something they did well rather than trying to guess at it I saw you make a great catch at practice the other day goes a lot further than Well I dont know anything about football but you must be good   Once you and your crush are more comfortable with each other you can make plans to spend more time together At first you may want to suggest something where something is going on or where other people will be to take some of the pressure off having to maintain conversation the whole time Some examples might include   A local sporting event particularly for one of your schoolâs teams if youâre at the same school The basketball team is playing Friday night do you want to go Invite them to see a show of some sort a band a movie or a theater production This one is great for people uncomfortable with conversation because it creates a shared experience an important part of getting closer to someone  while also not putting too much pressure on either party to talk Invite them to a party or social gathering coming up   If youâre trying to fake an interest in things you donât like or in behavior that isnât you because you think it will impress your crush then theyll eventually notice your awkwardness and discomfort with it Heâll respect you more and youâll get along better if youâre honest rather than if you lie about your tastes in order to try to please him  Many people practice staying in the moment through meditation or other exercises You donât need to become a Zen master for your crush though Simply pay attention when theyre talking and respond appropriately Theyll appreciate your interest and attention Todayâs world is full of distractions donât let things like your smartphone take your attention away from the person youre spending time with   Many people value the opinion and respect of their peers It isnât strictly necessary that you get to know your crushs friends but if your crush is feeling interested in you but unsure about whether to proceed the encouragement and approval of their friends will help You donât have to please them but just letting them get to know you a little better can go a long way in winning their endorsement   Since youve already established a comfort level with spending time together in social situations you can propose activities where itâs just the two of you spending time together Going out for a cup of coffee or going for a walk in the park are two good examples   Your crush may be showing signs they are interested in you too Some of these signs differ in men and women but here are some keys to look for   If a guy straightens his posture or fixes his hair when he sees you its because he wants to look his best around you Similarly women will smooth their clothing and toss their hair back to allow their face to be better seen How a woman handles her purse can tell you a lot about what shes thinking If she is holding it tightly or in front of her shes uncomfortable If she holds it to her side or loosely she is comfortable with you and doesnt want it to get in the way of getting closer to you When youâre talking if your crush touches their face fidgets or stutters or is on the edge of his seat when you talk these are signs theyre nervous because they are feeling attracted to you too Wanting to get physically closer to you or whisper in your ear is a great sign for you these behaviors indicate your crush desires intimacy Nothing says you have to wait If you think your crush is interested in you but hesitant to make the first move you may want to go ahead and make it Sometimes your crush is shy or intimidated by you and in these cases youll have more luck making the move yourselfAsk them on a date tell them about your feelings or even make the first move physically like with a kiss on the cheek I really like hanging out with you would you like to go on a date sometime Tradition dictates that men ask women out but that is less strictly true in this day and age so no matter your gender if you feel the time is right to make a move go ahead and make it

Dont use materials like plastic  The bigger the animal the larger the container should be Dont scrub them with anything abrasive You want them to stay as pristine as possible Scratches and abrasions will encourage mold and bacteria growth It doesnt work unless you are sending it through a commercial level dishwasher which uses soap anyway Use whatever soap you use and be sure to rinse it really well Do it at least twice a day If it is a warm day they will be needing more water than usual and no one wants to drink gross water It helps to ensure that there are fewer germs and parasites for your pets to be exposed to The tiny amount of hydrogen peroxide that they are exposed to is insignificant There are more and more things in our water that we dont want in our bodies If you drink filtered water so should they
Say hi and do a cute smile If he responds well done Next thing ask him how he is If he returns with a question then youre onto a winner  He will soon begin to notice you and realise how nice you are   An example conversation you might have would be is do you have any siblings at the school or so what lesson have you got next do you like it Find out what his interests are or what he thinks of a new song thats been released   Mention things he might be interested in make him laugh There is nothing better than making guys laugh Once they know you have a sense of humor he should soon look forward to your lessons together because you can have a bit of a laugh   Remember You just have to be yourself Compliment him on his new trainers maybe ask if hes had a haircut because his new haircut is looking pretty good Touch his arm when youre talking slightly Or perhaps you could tease him a bit but play nice   Make it cool and casual Say something like is it cool if we swap numbers I need someone to contact when I get stuck on homework You could also just ask it on Facebook just saying can I have your phone number Im sure hell say yes   Now this doesnt have to be a date if you dont want it to be Invite all your friends out and ask him if he wanted to come and bring some of his mates because it would be a good laugh
Always train the horse with a mild snaffle bit before moving on to a more severe option Stronger bits can provide more control which may be useful for horse shows Some excitable horses will resist stopping with a mild bit but focus on ground work training first Some spirited or sensitive horses will object to a harsh bit and continue misbehaving   Think about your typical riding activities Youll typically want a mild bit for riding in the school and perhaps a stronger bit for more strenuous activity Check the bit regulations of any horse competitions you plan to enter   Beginning riders are more likely to harm the horse with a strong bit You should have a fair amount of riding experience before you try to use one Even then ask your trainer for advice on choosing a bit and on adjusting your rein use to adapt to a new bit   There are many variations of bits and you may need to try several before you find one that works Most English riders just move to a snaffle with a harsher mouthpiece or ring Western riders may try a different style of bit altogether such as the curb bit These use leverage to increase the amount of pressure from your pull The Pelham and the Slotted Kimberwick are two common options which use a curb chain to provide more control over the head   Bitless riding is becoming more popular although it is not yet legal in most competitions Even if you use a harsh bit some of the time consider training without a bit occasionally This will improve your own balance and strength and teach you to direct the horse with cues from the seat This may even solve some behavioral issues as many horses calm down when the mouth is no longer agitated   Bitless riding is allowed in most jumpers polo and endurance competitions For other disciplines you will need to compete with a bit â but you may still benefit from the training
Find out what your crush likes to do Ask them some question about their favorite activities Find out what kinds of music books or movies your crush enjoys This can be great material for a conversation Everyone likes talking about their own interests   If you know any of your crushs friends you can also ask them some questions about your crushs interests Sometimes having the news that you are asking questions about your crush get back to them can have an added bonus It can signal that you like them without coming out and saying it Hopefully you and your crush like some of the same things Once youve found out what he or she likes this should give you some ideas about things to talk about when you are together It can also give you some ideas for things you might be able to do together   Dont pretend to like things you dont like to impress your crush This isnt being true to yourself Also your crush will find out eventually that you dont actually like or know much about it This can be embarrassing For example if you and your crush have the same favorite band that can be great material for a conversationBut if you hate a band and your crush asks you about them just politely say that you dont like them much Then bring up something you do like That way you dont seem negative but you arent pretending to be someone you arent   Once youve had a chance to chat with your crush a little look for some opportunities to spend time together   Use your common interests as a way to do this If you like to draw and your crush is in the art club you can join too If you both like baseball see if your crush wants to go to a game At first its probably a good idea to try to spend time with your crush in a situation where other people are around But once youve had a chance to get to know each other try asking your crush to do something where it will just be the two of you Most people enjoy being around people who are positive So when youre spending time with your crush try to be positive and happy After all hopefully being around this person makes you feel good   Dont put yourself down Nobody likes a bragger but at the same time you shouldnt belittle yourself If you want your crush to like you you should show that you like yourself If your crush gives you a compliment say thanks Dont complain too much Everyone has a hard day now and then and needs to blow off a little steam Mainly though try to keep your conversations with your crush lighthearted and fun

Love is a beautiful joyous emotion But it is also a powerful word and you shouldnt throw it around with your man unless youre sure you mean it This doesnt mean you need to write a thesis on your feelings But you do need to ask yourself what you hope to gain by telling him you love him   If hes already said I love you and you know you feel the same feel free to come out and say it If your relationship is strong and you know him and yourself well it might be time to say I love you If youre convinced youre in love and need to tell him so then trust your instincts and say it If you want to tell him just to see if hell say I love you back or because you feel pressured to say it dont Love is something you give to others it doesnt expect or need someone elses responseIf youre just friends but want more you should consider asking him out before saying you love him Make sure you can spend quality time together before launching an Lbomb This will also give you a great chance to gauge his own feelings towards you More likely than not if you love him then he will feel some attraction back towards you Just focus on letting go and having fun  love is not about forcing your feelings  so take your time and build a relationship   At the end of the day this is about you confidently telling him how you feel If youre not sure if he likes you back that is okay Thats why you want to tell him your own feelings Is he comfortable hanging out with just you If not telling him youre in love might come off a little too strongly   Sometimes you just need some perspective A big reason many people wont say I love you is that theyre afraid the partner doesnt feel the same way At the end of the day it comes down to speaking your mind and feelings honestly However if youre a little worried   Ask a mutual trusted friend if they can see you two dating Talk to one of his friends and see if he is interested in anyone right now If youre feeling bold ask if he has any feelings for you Even best friends can be taken aback by the powerful words I love you You might have thought about this love for months but for him this is big sudden news Imagine yourself in a similar situation  you have a friend you like who suddenly tells you they are in love Youd be at a loss for words to say the least So dont jump right to love  take your time exploring your feelings together Test the water a few weeks in advance with   I just wanted to tell you that I really like you I love spending time with you This has been a great few months Lets go on a few dates just you and me for a change   Love the most blissfully confusing human emotion around If you feel overwhelmed with affection feel your stomach flip every time you see him and want to blurt out I love you at every turn chances are good youre head over heels in love But as strong as the feeling is avoid the temptation to immediately tell anyone Instead sit back and enjoy the rush of love for a few days Show yourself that this isnt just a crush this is the real thing If you still feel like you love him then get ready to make your move   If you dont still feel attached to him after the a few days than you hadnt a crush not love Love stays around for a long while   It is scientifically proven then men say I love you first more often than womenTo make matters worst many dating books are hardset on the woman always saying I love you second The reasons are fuzzy evolutionary advantage for men who create commitment early on or made up women who say it first seem overly needy but there is something to be said for tradition Like it or not some men are weirded out when a woman says I love you first This shouldnt keep you from expressing your feelings but it is worth considering
Its an alltoocommon tale of woe someone confesses true love to a best friend only to discover that things arent really the same after Telling your best friend that you love her forces both of you to reevaluate the way you look at each other Its important to weigh the relationship you have now against the one you might have only if everything goes well If your current relationship is really important to you you may not want to risk it   The fact that its almost impossible to go back to the way things were after your confession doesnt necessarily mean that youll ruin your relationship with your best friend However it does mean that youll almost definitely change it For example if you used to see movies together in a strictly platonic way this may become an awkward activity  Its very important not to fool yourself into thinking that youll live happily ever after with her if you can just tell her how you feel Doing this is setting yourself up for a huge disappointment if she doesnt feel the same way You dont have to be a pessimist about your chances but you do need to be realistic and remember that its her choice whether things move further â not a sure thing If you cant bear the thought of rejection you may want to move on   Remember that rejection doesnt always mean that youre not good enoughThere are a number of reasons why someone may not want to date For instance she may not want to have a serious relationship with anyone at the moment There may even be things that you dont know about that prevent her from dating like work and school commitments that take all of her time   Did your feelings for your best friend arrive suddenly without warning If so you may want to give yourself a few weeks or months to see whether the feelings stick Feeling attracted to someone today doesnt necessarily mean youll feel the same way forever Dont risk a great friendship with a confession of love only to discover that what you really had was a shortterm crush or as psychologists say an infatuation Below are just a few signs that these professionals use to identify infatuationInfatuation comes on almost instantly rather than gradually Infatuation is powerful but shortlived Infatuation is mainly focused on physical attraction Infatuation makes you see the other person as perfect or flawless  This is different than seeing someone as perfect for you that is someone who has flaws but you appreciate these flaws because you are able to compensate for them   Infatuation isnt being in love with someone else â its being in love with the feeling of being in love    Though it can be a little awkward to talk with other people about deeply personal feelings its often a good idea in situations like this Having a crush can make it hard to judge situations realistically so other peoples advice can be a huge help If it seems like most of your peers are telling you not to go after someone you should seriously consider their advice   A few people you may want to consider talking to include Your other friends  Her friends if you know them well enough â they may even be able to tell you how she feels about you Siblings or parents that youre especially close to A counselor or teacher you trust   When you tell your best friend you love her you want to do as much as you can to make her calm and comfortable Pick a time and a place where neither of you will have other big emotional stresses to worry about Its difficult for anyone to make smart decisions about romantic issues when theyre already under pressure from something else A few examples of things that can make for a lessthangreat environment to talk about your feelings with her include   She has something important coming up that she needs to focus on like a big exam or a role in a play She has just gotten out of a major relationship or is still in one â this is a definite nogo She is going through a difficult period in her life trouble at work or school family issues etc An example of a good time and place to bring your feelings up is when youre enjoying a comfortable casual oneonone hangout on the weekend   Dropping delicate hints about your intentions is a good way to judge

out   Dating is something you do after you establish a romantic connection with someone â not before Treating your best friend to a nice candlelit dinner may seem like a nice thing to do but it can be

session   In addition youll be spending money maybe even quite a bit of it on something that may turn out poorly for you If you save your money you can always take someone else on a date if your best friend doesnt have romantic feelings for you   Theres almost no way to have this conversation without both of you having strong emotions so give her the courtesy of a little privacy You dont have to be completely isolated for this but it should be someplace comfortable where your conversation wont be overheard and you wont be interrupted   An example of a good place to have this conversation is a bench in a park far away from other people Youll be comfortable it will unlikely for other people to interfere and best of all youll have a romantic view Whatever you do dont make a big public spectacle Remember that theres a significant chance shell say no â in this case attracting a crowd will be very embarrassing for both of you   When youre with your best friend somewhere private and comfortable you have one final chance to back out If youre still ready to go through with things its time to tell her whats been on your mind Do your best to stay relaxed while you open up to your friend Remember â itll all be over soon and even if things dont go your way youll at least have peace of mind   Its only natural to get some butterflies and many girls will find a little nervousness cute but being so nervous that you can barely get your words out will make things a lot harder See our article on staying calm under stress for more help   Dont waste much time beating around the bush Be simple and direct Tell your friend how she makes you feel This will be different for everyone so try to follow your heart A few things you may want to mention are suggested below but feel free to phrase things differently if you think it will be more genuine   Tell her that lately youve been thinking of her as more than a friend and that you wanted to know how she felt Tell her that youve been struggling your feelings for some time and that youre just relieved to finally open up about it Tell her that no matter how she feels you value her and you want to have a positive relationship with her This is crucial â you dont want her to feel like youre only interested in knowing her if she wants to be romantic with you   This conversation is likely to be a little awkward no matter which way it goes However you can make things much less awkward for both of you if you give your friend a reasonable way to say no without embarrassing herself This isnt as hard as it sounds â basically just mention that its OK if she doesnt want to get together right now A few things you may want to mention are listed below   Tell her that you completely understand if she cant be in a relationship right now Tell her that you dont know whether she has anything going on in her life that might keep you two from dating Stress that you wont be upset if she doesnt feel the same way as you   Big dramatic displays of emotion might seem like a good idea but they can make this conversation a lot more stressful and tense than it needs to be Try to talk in a calm voice and to use a friendly lighthearted tone You can even use a little humor to ease the tension by joking about how antsy youve been to talk about this â a wellplaced laugh can make things much easier    Note You will probably want to avoid actually using the word love For many people this word can have a huge weight that may make the prospect of being with you a little scary Most relationship experts recommend against using the L word until after youre dating The decision youre asking your friend to make is an important one Dont force her into a position where she has to give you an answer right away or she may not be able to give the best most honest answer possible If she seems on the fence tell her that its alright if she needs some time to think Tell her that youre willing to give her space while shes making up her mind   Ask for your friends input throughout the conversation â be sure to allow her to express her self and not to dominate the conversation When she comes to a decision whether thats right away or days later listen to what she says Its OK to ask questions about the way she feels but dont question the decision itself This is her decision to make and yours to accept not the other way around   If she doesnt feel the same way about you that you feel about her dont try to change her mind This is an easy way to come across as desperate If you really love her you should want her to be happy even if you dont agree with her reasoning   If your best friend reacts positively congratulations Celebrate your success by planning a date with your new sweetheart If on the other hand your friend doesnt like the idea of romance you should be prepared to step back from your relationship â at least for a while There may be difficult feelings on both side even if your best friend lets you down gently and gracefully   Luckily as the old saying goes time heals all wounds Spending a few weeks or a month away from someone whos rejected you can be a very good thing It can allow you to heal accept the fact that you wont be getting together and move on to new romantic prospects When you do meet up with your best friend again take things slow You may not go back to the same level of intimacy you had before right away Be willing to gradually work your way back into a close platonic relationship It may not be exactly the same as the relationship you used to have but its unlikely to be worse
Maybe you are already dating someone and you no longer want to be There are ways to kindly reject your significant other Your first step is to face the situation head onDont try to delay the breakup If you want to end the relationship its best to get it over with Dont wait for the other person to break up with you It can be tempting to try to be mean or avoid making plans so that your partner will end the relationship Making someone want to breakup with you doesnt make you the nicer person Its just a way of putting the burden on someone else   Ending a relationship can be painful It can also be a very awkward conversation Try to make it as smooth as possible by being as kind and gentle as possibleDont play the blame game You dont need to say Im breaking up with you because youre a horrible person Its okay to voice your concerns Just be honest and constructive For example you could say I cant date you anymore It really bothers me that you repeatedly break plans with me without any warning You can also say something nice You could try There are a lot of great things about dating you However its time for me to move on   You might be nervous if you have to reject someone Sometimes it can ease your anxiety if you make a plan Put some thought into how you will approach the conversationThink about the main points For example if you are breaking up because you dont want to be in a relationship make sure to say that Write down some notes It can be useful to see your thoughts in writing It can also help you remember what you want to say Think about the other persons feelings Try out some different variations of This isnt working to figure out what feels natural and honest   Anytime you have to have the talk its going to be difficult If you choose an appropriate time you can make it a little more bearable Take the other persons perspective into accountBreakup in person It can be tempting to send a text or email but you should avoid doing so It is kinder and more respectful to have a face to face conversation Try to avoid having a public breakup For example dont choose a friends birthday party as the setting for an important conversation Give some warning Let the other person know that you need to have a serious talk Try saying I have to talk to you about something that you probably wont like   Ending a relationship can feel complicated You might feel like easing out of dating is nicer to the other person However it is more effective to definitively end thingsSet clear boundaries You can try saying I think its best if we dont communicate at all for a while Consider blocking the other person on social media That way no one will be tempted to monitor Facebook or Instagram statuses Dont lead anyone on After you have broken up do not flirt with your ex or try to make plans with them
Guinea pigs need a cage that is at least 75 square foot and even bigger for three The bigger the cage the better Guinea pigs love to run around often called zoomies and popcorning They cant do this in a tiny amount of space A large cage is essential for exercise too Hutches are typically suited for the outdoors You can purchase a simple onestory hutch with an opening and builtin hut or opt for a twostory hutch with a ramp Twostory hutches provide more room but they are still limited Hutches that expand outwards can also be bought These cages cannot be kept outdoors and must be positioned indoors C  C caging has become increasingly popular for its large sizing simple DIY cheap material and easy expansion and access If you would like an indoor cavy a C  C cage is the one for you Coops are just as good as a normal hutch Coops can actually be a better alternative to a hutch as theyre often bigger to fit a flock of standard chickens Some have attached runs to enable your guinea pig to have access to the lawn These are another satisfactory cage to buy but dont fall into the trap of getting a cage thats too small for your guinea pig or has a wired bottom Purchase one that is at least 75 square feet  Dont buy wired cages that are designed for mice rats or hamsters Guinea pigs are completely different to these smaller rodents and cannot withstand the same living conditions   Runs provide a lot of beneficial space but they arent the safest or best of cages to use They dont have much coverage from predators and cannot protect your guinea pigs from harsh weather conditions  A run is best used for guinea pigs on sunny days to provide exercise and fun time for your cavy under your supervision   Many pet shops tend to sell their customers cages that are way too small and are just not suitable for a guinea pig to live in Most dont meet the minimal requirements of 75 square feet and are more designed for small rodents such as mice and hamsters rather than cavies This is a once popular option and still is for those who dont put in the time to research the requirements of a guinea pig These types of caging dont allow for proper air circulation or provide enough space The cage you purchase should have a flat solid bottom Guinea pigs have sensitive feet A wire bottom will promote the growth of bumble foot which will then require medical care If you have cats and dogs or other wild predators in the area its your job to ensure that your guinea pigs cage is safe and secure Make sure that there are locks to the cages a roof solid floor and strong woodmetal  A wired cage or C  C cage will not suffice outdoors They arent stable and dont provide protection from predators   If you live in a very cold or hot climate you should consider keeping your guinea pigs indoors or at least have a backup indoor cage for your guinea pig to stay when the colderhotter months peak Guinea pigs are sensitive to temperature fluctuations and must eat a lot more to keep warm  Ideally the guinea pigs should be kept in a room that is approximately 6575 degrees Fahrenheit Guinea pigs dont do well in humid locations such as sheds and garages on hot days Humidity encourages bacteria to grow and can cause a fungal infection Guinea pigs have sensitive hearing so shouldnt be placed in an area that is prone to loud noises such as right beside televisions or loud stereos If you have young children place your guinea pigs cage in a room where you can monitor them and supervise any small children at the same time As much as its popular keeping your guinea pig outdoors isnt suggested as they dont like being confined in solitary Make your guinea pig feel a part of the family Keeping them in your bedroom should also be avoided as its another way for them to be forgotten   If youre buying a cage that requires a ramp or already comes with one make sure the ramp you acquire is suitable for your guinea pig The ramp mustnt be too steep where your guinea pig is prone too falling and it should have a good grip on it so that your guinea pig can go up and down with no problems There are many types of bedding to avoid when it comes to choosing the perfect material for your guinea pig This includes certain brands and even certain wood  Never use cedar or pine shavings These type of wood are toxic to guinea pigs and can cause serious respiratory problems The oils in them get stuck in their lungs However pine can be used as long as its aired out Never use sawdust Again the dust that is inhaled by guinea pigs is a major cause of respiratory disease and sneezing Never use corncob bedding Corncob has a tendency to mold and is hard on their feet Since guinea pigs have sensitive feet you should steer clear of corncobNever primarily use newspaper Although newspaper is perfectly fine itself and can be used as lining at the bottom of the cage it isnt absorbent enough to use as your main bedding Never use straw Straw is tough and can easily cause eye injuries It isnt absorbent enough to be used as bedding and can also be expensive   Many guinea pig experts suggest to stay away from wood shavings as a lot of risks are involved with the use of this material such as oils that dry the skin dust that ultimately causes respiratory problems and possible eye irritation Fleece is a popular choice to use as bedding as it seems to have little to no problems at all However keeping your guinea pig on fleece will require more regular cleaning including spot cleaning daily and an overall clean weekly Shredded bedding can be purchased from pet stores or you can shred your own Its quite absorbent and soft on your cavies feet without any toxins in it This makes it a safe material to use However it will absorb their urine and make the smell linger CareFresh helps eliminate odours and is soft on the guinea pigs feet However some tend to avoid unnaturally scented or colored bedding to lessen any risks Aspen is another popular choice as it contains no toxic oils unnatural scents or dyes Its completely natural and safe to use You can buy this specific kind of bedding at pet stores Hay can be quite absorbent natural safe and help control odours However its quite pricey if you dont buy it from the right place Pet stores are notorious for overcharging when it comes to hay But you can easily purchase hay from equestrian centers or farm stops for approximately 5 a bale You can opt for a water bottle or a water bowl which are completely different to each other You can always buy both if you have more than one guinea pig  Water bottles keep bedding food and hay out of the water if your guinea pig is living in a smaller area but theyre notorious for leaking and soiling the bedding Water bowls dont leak and are a more natural way for your guinea pig to acquire water But they can get messy if you use wood shavings as bedding or keep their foodhay nearby   The guinea pig pellets should be kept inside the bowl for hygienic reasons and to keep them from spoiling You can purchase two if you would like to keep their vegetables in a bowl also or even more if you have two guinea pigs or more that require 1 cup of vegetables each Guinea pigs are prey animals their instinct is to hide when in fear You need to have at least one or two hideouts for your guinea pigs as a safe place and a relaxing centre One of the worst things you can do is stress your guinea pig out and with the option of seeking refuge in a hut you can reduce stress levels Toys help stimulate the mind and encourage exercise and of course promote fun and enjoyment Toys are a great way to reduce boredom depression and even loneliness However dont overcrowd their cage with toys Guinea pigs need space to run too  Toy obstacles can promote exercise whilst chew toys can help prevent dentistry problems as guinea pig teeth are forever growingConsider toys such as igloos tunnels bridges wood blocks cat toys with bells on them cage accessories hammocks cosies etc Dont buy wood toys that splinter wire balls or any toys that can be a choking hazard   Hay racks can help bundle the hay together and keep it in place making the overall space of the cage cleaner and more hygienic However avoid wire hay racks and opt for cotton bagssacks instead There are a number of incidences of guinea pigs getting their headsbodies stuck in between the wires Guinea pigs need their cages cleaned at least once a week and sometimes daily if you decide to spot clean especially if youre using fleece bedding You will need a brush cloth gloves petfriendly antibacterial spray scooper bin bags etc This is optional and most apply to longhaired breeds such as peruvians and shelties However you can choose to have some grooming products set aside for whenever you need it You could also optionally book an appointment with a professional groomer  Purchase a soft bristled brush Long haired guinea pigs require daily grooming to prevent knots and matting from forming in their fur Purchase clippers Longhaired breeds such as Shelties have constant growing fur that require clipping annually or perhaps every few months Buy nail trimmers Occasionally you might have to purchase nail trimmers to clip your guinea pigs overgrown nails   Unless you got your hutch home already assembled on a trailer it will require assembling including storebought hutches Hutches are quite easy to assemble providing that you have the instructions and all the parts to it Your hutch should be out of direct sunlight and preferably in a weather proof area under the roof of the house The area should be well ventilated secured away from predators and other pets and not too cold or too hot Straw or wood shavings is recommended for hutches Ones that go directly on grass will only need bedding in the inside area Consider lining the hutch with newspaper first and then your main bedding Guinea pig urine can stain bottom of wooden hutches The newspaper should catch any leaks  Hutches are best without the use of fleece   Water bottles can connect to the wire bars of the hutch or you can opt towards a water bowl instead Keep your water bowl a short distance from the pellets to prevent mess Guinea pigs benefit with at least two shelters to escape to when in fear especially in an outdoor hutch where many wild animals can scare your guinea pig Avoid overcrowding the hutch and keep most of the toys outside at the bottom level if its a twostory hutch Cosies can be kept in the inside area but to a minimum Most hay racks can be pitched up between the wires of the hutch even cotton hay racks The hay rack would be best positioned on the bottom story of the cage or away from the water bowl  Remember guinea pigs will make a lot of mess when it comes to hay They like to hide in it pull it out and sleep in it   The ramp shouldnt be too steep but should have a good grip on it so your guinea pigs can move up and down without any struggles or slips It should optionally have juts to make the grip better Firstly connect the grids which should be able to snap together easily with connectors Then you will have to set the coroplast at the same length as your gridsMake sure the opening of the cube grids arent too bigwide enough for your guinea pig to fit its head through If its head can fit through then its body will fit through too   C  Cs are not outdoor cages as they arent secure or weather proof at all Keep it in a room where you can supervise any young children but also keep it away from pets and loud noises However do not isolate the cage The guinea pigs should feel a part of the family not placed in solitary confinement Your bottom layer should be lined up with newspaper for extra absorbency and to catch any leaks and then your primary bedding Fleece is best suited for C  C cages but it doesnt limit you to the choice of many other types of bedding such as wood shavings or CareFresh Water bottles can be hooked onto the grids and your bowls can be positioned beside your water source unless youre using a bowl Dont place the pellets directly under the water bottle as bottles have the tendency to leak which will spoil the feed In an open cage without a lid you should have plenty of coverage with the use of huts bridges shelters and hideouts to help your guinea pig feel safe and secure and to give them a place to run to when in fear At least two should be satisfactory for your guinea pig  the more guinea pigs the more hideouts A spacious C  C cage could benefit with some toys for your guinea pigs entertainment You could add various tunnels hammocks and toy balls You can hook the hay rack onto the grid or if you dont have one place a pile of hay in the centre of the cage Most hay racks can be purchased online or in pet stores Avoid wire racks however Coops are very similar to hutches but most are a lot bigger than guinea pig hutches You can assemble them in the same manner They should come with instructions and all the necessary parts to assemble Coop best dwells on grass which will save you on bedding expenses Theres no need for lining the bottom layer with bedding as long as the coop is resting on grass Most coops can go in direct sunlight as their construction and frame offers permanent shade for your piggy but keep it under the shade of a tree on hotter days Coops can go on grass so it saves you spending a fortune on bedding But the nesting boxarea still needs to be lined up with bedding Its suggested to line a bottom layer of newspaper and then shavingshay Like other cages the bottle can grip onto the gridswiring However keep your pellets away from the edges of the cage as sudden rainy showers can spoil the unprotected food Keep it under the nesting boxramp The ramp shouldnt be too steep and should have a proper grip via soft sandpaper or juts in the ramp structure If your guinea pig is slipping or struggling to go up and down the ramp you might need to make some adjustments as the ramp is designed for chickens rather than rodents Guinea pigs still need a place to escape to even in a protected coop If your guinea pigs live outdoors its important for your guinea pigs to have a quick place to hide especially on the lower level Tunnels cosies toy balls and wood blocks can all make the coop seem a lot homely and friendly to your guinea pigs Avoid adding too many toys however The hay rack should be able to clip onto the grids of the coop Opt for cotton hay racks instead of wire hack racks which are proven to be dangerous to your guinea pig You should place it at the bottom of the cage Wired cages are just as easy to assemble as hutches and C  C caging Theyre actually very similar to C  C cages and can be set up the same way Wired cages arent suitable to go outdoors and should be kept inside your home The cage offers no protection from predators or harsh weather conditions thus why it should be kept inside of your house where the guinea pig can get plenty of family interaction The type of bedding you use is very similar to C  C cages Fleece is the most popular options however you can still use any other bedding choice available You should line newspaper at the bottom to ensure extra absorbency and so that you can catch leaks As usual the bottles can be hung up by the grids whilst pellets should be placed in the bowl and away from the water source to prevent leaks into the food You should provide at least two huts for your guinea pig however keep it at a minimum as the space is limited Space availability in wire cages can be limited so keep the toys to a minimum The maximum might be three or four Remember to add various toys such as tunnels wood blocks and hammocks for your guinea pigs to play with As mentioned in the steps above you can hook the hay rack to the cage but avoid using wired hay racks with can pose a potential hazard to your guinea pig

When you feel your heart thudding faster and faster pay attention to how you are breathing Remember the quicker you breathe the less air your lungs get That means your heart is speeding up to pump the little oxygen you have to the rest of your body So make a point of taking deep breaths to calm your body and mindBreathe in through your nose and out through your mouth Imagine that your lungs are down in your abs Think about filling your abs with air instead of your chest This will help you draw longer breaths  Keep your focus on what is happening outside of you rather than inside Focus all of your attention entirely on him Empty your mind of everything else Ignore your own internal reactions worries and concerns Just pay attention to what he says and does and react to thatObviously youâre a human being hoping to have a conversation here so you canât really empty your mind of everything The goal is to quiet any thoughts that donât have anything to do with the immediate conversation Just think about what youâre going to say in response to what he says not how you feel inside For example If he asks for your opinion on something like your taste in music speak from the gut and tell the truth regardless of what his opinion may be Keep the conversation going instead of stalling it by trying to secondguess yourself about what he will think of your answer If he says something you disagree with say so Dont start yourself worrying about how he might react Its better to deal with his reaction whatever it may be than worry over a hundred different scenarios that probably wont happen anyway   Play something relaxing and keep an ear tuned to that If not just play a song that usually calms you down in the back of your head   The key is to play something calming Your breathing heart rate and other body rhythms will naturally fall in sync with the musicâs rhythm This is also a great ice breaker to get the conversation rolling and find out his interests Depending on where you are subtle ways to go about this could be fiddling with a car radio switching between music channels on TV starting your iPod or other device before you engage him or asking him if he wants to check out that jukebox in the corner   With one hand form an âOâ by bringing the tip of your index finger and the tip of your thumb together Leave your other three fingers straight but relaxed Sounds weird but this is actually a yoga trick known as the Gyan Mudra Instead of focusing on all the thoughts and feelings building up inside you just concentrate on keeping the tips of your thumb and index together togetherIf you think this will look weird just hold your hands behind your back or use whatever youâre holding like a textbook to hide it from view   Release your stress by moving around Get your blood flowing and get rid of the tension building up inside you Fullout dancing is a proven way to lower your anxiety but even though it would probably be too weird if you broke out into a jig for no reason moving around just a little bit will still helpA simple solution is to just get the conversation mobile by suggesting a walkandtalk If youre already playing music let yourself move to the rhythm Slowly stepping off and on a curb or stair step also be a way to burn off nervous energy without looking too odd
Its no good shouting its time we had a break from each other and then storming off The decision to take a break in a relationship is a really tough one and if you dont take it together in a calm and considered manner it bodes ill for the outcome Find a moment to sit down together and be honest with one another Talk about what has brought both of you to this point and why you think a break would be a healthy option right now  Do not interrupt or fob off his worries You both need to hear each other clearly without passing judgment   This is about setting the ground rules and your hopes for reconciliation postbreak It is an important time to reassure each other that this is about clearing your heads determining what you both want from the future and being absolutely sure about getting back together   Set ground rules you can both agree on         For most people it is not an excuse to fool around its important to make that clear Determine how each of you will deal with approaches from other people who find out youre on a break that will help to quell the anxiety that a new relationship might be inserted into the space   What changes do you think will be needed What changes does your boyfriend want Reach a happy compromise in relation to each others wants What will stay the same without feeling awkward or uncomfortable Will you continue to talk to one another facetoface Will you use social media to stay in touch Will you take a complete break from communicating with each other Will you set times to catch up and review how things are going You need to face these questions now and not just wander off blindly in the hope that things will resolve themselves as the break takes place Things unsaid have a way of turning into confirmation that whatever you or he wants goes   It could be a week a month six months etc Alternatively you may prefer no set time just subject to review and mutual agreement some time down the track     Create an activity list This will give you an opportunity to look forward to each new day that approaches instead of pacing and worrying about if he will call It is important to learn that your life should never revolve around one single person That only sets you up to be devastated if they end up wanting a break up   This can be your time to shine academically or professionally   Meet new people and try new things   That said learn to tell the difference between loneliness and solitude Solitude is the time for you to reflect about your future your wishes for the relationship and to consider your feelings about the break Use times of solitude to write your journal write out your feelings and prepare lists of issues you want to raise with your boyfriend   If you feel like the odd one out you may end up losing your nerve and feeling awful You might also make poor decisions based on what everyone else has it is best to hang around with people in all sorts of different stages of life   Youll both need to reassess the direction things are going from time to time so its important to talk at least for the purposes of determining how both of you are feeling about the future This could be a twoweekly monthly or even quarterly meetup Choose what suits both of you Try not to rush things though give each other sufficient time to have done some good thinking before discussing what next   Keep notes about the things that occur to you while contemplating the future of your relationship together It can feel overwhelming when you get back to together and you may forget to raise some of the key issues that you really want addressed Suggest that he does the same thing so that you can compare notes and not leave the important things left unsaid   For example I feel _ when you _ and I would appreciate it if you would _ instead of _   Whether youve set a deadline or youve mutually agreed that its time to decide what next you must be honest with yourself Do you want the relationship to resume or has the break changed your perspective and you think that itd be best if the two of you just stayed friends   Be careful of feelings of loyalty While its noble to be loyal this isnt the reason for staying with someone when the fire has died out You can transfer the loyalty to a friendship Be aware of his feelings but be careful not to let these take over your own feelings For example he is really sad and disappointed that youve decided not to resume the relationship avoid feeling obliged to resume it just because of his sadness It will pass   Since this is a real possibility and you have probably harbored a lot of fantasy notions about things going back to the way they were it can be a real whammy What is really important is to use the break to reach acceptance that this is as much a possible outcome as resuming the relationship Consider what you will do if you do break up for real and you will need to move forward This is where the keeping busy and resuming your other social linkages comes to the foreplay it will hurt to know things arent going on but youre not being thrown back into a void Rather you have friends family and your own pursuits to fall back into   This will be a challenge too because the time apart was spent thinking things through and possibly reaching conclusions you hadnt wanted to face before It is really important to talk about what feelings you had during the break how these have changed your perspective and what changes you want to bring to the relationship and into the future Listen to his changed perspective too Seek to

Even if it really seems like it this is not hisher fault Also if you dont know  or barely know  the person you run the risk of freaking himher out and its possible you could also feel extremely embarrassedashamed of yourself for losing control afterwards You dont want to make things any harder on yourself by letting  what is already a tough situation  lead to further negative emotions and problems Instead wait until you can be by yourself to let out your emotions  But dont take it out on yourself even if it is very tempting to do so Spend as much time as you need releasing your feelings Eventually you will feel better even if this takes some time   Especially not if you dont like who the crush really is as a person This does not include how you thought that this person was   Think about exactly what it was about your crush that disappointed you and how this would have affected you if youd gone on to have a relationship with them Its likely that if anything about them especially put you off them romantically  then the thingthings would have made you highly unsatisfied or unhappy in some way If this is the case count this experience as being a lucky escape  and remember that there are other fish in the sea Just because you happened to have a strong crush on one person does not mean that this will never happen to you again with someone else Its even possible that the next time the crush will turn out not to be the disappointment this one has   Avoiding is really tempting and we all do it but in the long run it really makes most situations worse Itll also make it harder to get what has happened out of your mind If you are in any kind of regular contact with them just try your best to treat them as you would any other casual acquaintance or friend Not only does it make things less awkward for them but itll make getting back to normal much easier for you   Unless of course there is a very good reason for this ie they treated you badly in some way Even if you feel turned off by them romantically that does not mean that you cant try this  if in general you get along with them reasonably well or feel theres a good chance you might You might gain a really great friendship out of this experience   Regardless of how disappointed this person made you feel remember that caring for yourself and your needs is far more important than dwelling on this other person

If youre experiencing crushes frequently try to take a step back Think about how you would view your behavior if you were an outsider in the situation Give your feelings an objective assessment to see if theyre healthyLook at your past and present crushes and relationships Are you drawn to a particular type of a person Do you tend to bounce from one crush to another If youve ever had a relationship with your crush was it healthy Do you tend to have crushes even if youre in a committed relationship Own up to whether or not having crushes is detrimental to you Avoid feelings of blame directed towards yourself or others in favor of simply addressing your own behavioral patterns over time  Having a crush on someone is a normal part of life However because crushes can be so powerful on an emotional level they can become obsessive If youve noticed you have a tendency to obsess try to figure out how to refrain from letting that tendency take over Try to reduce the amount of time spent dwelling on crushes in the futureThinking about your crush while you are trying to work or do something else can be a sign that youre focusing too much on them Do you usually allow your feelings about a crush to distract you from work school or other relationships If so try consciously changing your focus if you notice your mind dwelling on crushes too much Bring your attention back to whatever it was you were doing before you started thinking about your crush Try taking 90 seconds to take a series of deep breaths focusing only on your breathing This can help you get thoughts of your crush out of your mind and return your brain to the present Continual crushes can bring up powerful emotions causing you to constantly dwell on one potential romantic partner or another To avoid this it can be useful to stay focused on other things you enjoy instead of fixating on a string of crushes Keeping your mind busy with other things can be a good way to get over a crush Try thinking about your plans for the future work that you have to get done movies you want to see or other things that you find engaging Try to do activities that take up your attention Avoid doing something that might let your mind wander back to thinking about your crush Remember it is normal to have crushes Its okay to occasionally indulge in a lighthearted crush However if having crushes is becoming a problem keeping busy can help you from letting your feelings get out of control   Spending time with other people can be a great way to get your mind off of a crush If youre having a great conversation with someone or doing something fun together its easy to forget about your crush Try doing something fun with your friends or family to help get over a crush quicklyYour friends and family can be a great support system if you are having trouble dealing with a crush Try talking with them if it feels overwhelming If your crush is part of your group of friends try hanging out with your friends individually for a while Sometimes the need to have crushes can be due to a lack of emotionally intimacy in other areas of your life Working on building strong relationships with friends and family members may reduce your need to develop crushes   If youre keen on the notion of lessening intense crushes have a game plan in place Think about what to do if you start develop too strong or too intense of a crush in the future Have a way to break the pattern in mindDoes having crushes make you feel less lonely or sad If so find other ways to deal during those moments Try to say strengthen a plutonic bond you have or work on a hobby or skill of your own Feeling more secure about yourself and your relationships may lessen your need for strong crushes It may be hard to stick to a plan at first especially if youre used to having a lot of crushes that get out of control Know going into your plan you may feel sad and frustrated at times However try to also acknowledge these feelings will be worth it long term as you wont allow crushes to get out of control   Even though you might not want the feelings that a strong crush on someone can bring its important to accept them for what they are Its perfectly fine to have a crush and take notice of it without engaging it People have small crushes throughout their lives People even have crushes when theyre already in stable romantic relationships Just because you have a crush doesnt mean you need to act on it or let it make your choices for youDo not feel guilty about having a crush even if its on someone whos not available You cannot control how you feel If you have romantic feelings for a married coworker for example you may feel guilty However you are not choosing to have these feelings The only you can control is your reactions How people react to feelings defines their morality not the feelings themselves Try to say something to yourself like I have a crush on Brandon but hes married Its not wrong to feel this way I cant help it Im not going to act on it so I dont need to become overwhelmed with guilt   When you have a crush on someone its all too easy to focus only on the good things about them If youre prone to intense crushes you may have a tendency to put your crushes on a pedestal right away Imbalanced views can create unrealistic images of others Try to change your focus and find things that you might not like about your crushes as they arise This can help you get over crushes faster and may reduce the number of crushes you have   It can be challenging However keeping a balanced opinion of your crush can help you cope You dont need to be mean but finding things you dont like about someone can help you stay neutral in your opinion of them Remind yourself your crush has flaws and the fantasy relationship youre spinning is unlikely to work out as well in reality   Although having a crush can bring on intense and overwhelming feelings crushes dont last It can help knowing that the crush wont be a permanent feeling and that things will eventually return to normal This can keep you from allowing your feelings from becoming obsessive You will see this more as a fleeting feeling than a long life changing relationship This can be particularly important for crushes accrued when youre already in a committed relationshipRemember most crushes last for around four months If you tend to have one crush after another theyll probably be in the four month range Remind yourself your feelings may have an expiration date to help keep them in check Crushes will fade in time generally leaving you with thoughts like âI dont know what I saw in them to begin withâ Remind yourself of this when you start obsessing over the person   Oftentimes people enjoy the intensity of a crush There is nothing wrong with allowing yourself to enjoy the happy feelings a crush brings even if theyre fleeting However these feelings can get out of control Continually remind yourself that you are in control of your own happinessYou may find that after awhile you rely on small gestures of attention or care from your crush to feel happy This can easily backfire on you leaving you reeling Remind yourself that while its nice to have a crush only you can make yourself happy You will have to learn to rely on your own hobbies interests and passions for happiness rather than another person   Having a crush can be tough Crushes can make you feel hurt confused frustrated or any number of painful things Since it can be so difficult to have a crush its important that you take care of yourself Try doing something fun getting your feelings out by writing or drawing or giving yourself a small treat once in a while Taking care of yourself until the crush fades can help make things a lot easier on you If you believe your continual crushes are becoming a problem admit this Being honest with yourself about negative behavior is an important step to overcoming these behaviorsThink about what your crushes are doing to you emotionally Are you neglecting school work to obsess over various crushes Do you have a new crush each week who you cannot live without thinking of constantly Acknowledge that crushes are causing you more unhappiness and anxiety than anything This can help you recognize you need to acknowledge underlying issues that drive your need to have frequent crushes   Be realistic about each new crush you have This can help you figure out if this really a meaningful important crush or if youre just feeling something to feel itWould you truly act on this crush and if so what would happen There are often many reasons not to act on a crush You may have a crush on someone from work You may already be in a relationship Thinking about what would happen if you acted on your crushes can help you trace patterns Maybe you always develop crushes on unavailable people This could say something about larger romantic patterns in your life Maybe you crush on people you cant have to avoid true intimacy   Crushes can represent real feelings that should be acted on However if you constantly have crushes something else may be at play Crushes may represent a need thats not being met elsewhere in lifeThink about your lash crush and what they represented to you Consider the circumstances of your life at the time Think about past crushes Did they represent similar things For example maybe your last crush was on a married coworker The crush before that was on your boss who office policy forbids you from dating What did these people represent In this case your crushes are on people who you cannot really be with Did you experience a bad breakup in the past Maybe developing crushes on unobtainable people helps you feel romantic feelings without having to risk actual intimacy   If you seem to have obsessive crushes often you may suffer from a condition like love addiction If your crushes are interfering with your daily life to the point youre unable to complete basic tasks make an appointment with a therapist A qualified therapist can help you learn to identify the triggers for intense crushes and how to better regulate your emotions

Taking wolves out of the wild can be very dangerous and might end in injury or even death   If you are still interested in owning a wolf or wolf hybrid visit a wolf sanctuary Many sanctuaries have both wolves and wolf dogs that you can observe Before getting one of these exotic animals talk to an expert at the sanctuary They can help answer your questions give you more information and help you understand the responsibility that goes into owning a wolf or wolf dog   Try finding wolf and wolf dog owners in your area Contact them and arrange a meeting They can be a valuable source of information since they own an exotic animal Some of these sanctuaries rescue wolf hybrids and may let you adopt one from them   You cannot get away with buying a wolf or wolf hybrid and hoping it will figure out how to be a good pet Wolves are not dogs They need a lot of training to become suitable as a companion which takes a lot of time and effort on the owners part   These animals are cunning and extremely intelligent They pose a much greater challenge than dogs Some wolf hybrids are docile while others are essentially wild If you dont have the patience or time to train and care for the wolf dont get oneIf you have never owned and trained a dog do not attempt to get a wolf or wolf hybrid Many owners who arent prepared for their wolf or wolf dog end up either dropping them off at sanctuaries which are already overcrowded or taking them to the animal shelter where they will likely be put to sleep Letting them go into the wild almost guarantees they will die Adopting a wolf then getting rid of it does irreparable harm to the wolf Since they are pack animals being split from their home and pack can cause the wolf to get extreme anxiety and even fall ill   Wolves show affection differently than dogs Sometimes this affection can be confused with aggression Wolves greet each other with affection but since they cant give hugs they use their mouths Wolves will chew on packmates faces in greeting or as affection Wolves may do this to people too Most of the time the wolf will approach you touch its nose to yours and then lick your teeth However if you get scared and pull away the wolf will grab your face with its teeth to bring you back so it can greet you and show its affection Wolves love small children but they might get excited jump on them and try to carry them with their teeth by the head or arm This could cause injury to the child when the wolf was only showing affectionThese demonstrations of affection can easily be confused for attacks   Wolves like to roam and they will hop fences break off chains and dig their way out of yards This can be very dangerous because the wolf might be mistaken for a wild wolf or coyote and be shot Or it might kill neighbors livestock or pets Never let the wolf roam free   LC and some MC wolves can exist in a normal fence without breaking free MC and HC wolves are most likely to try to break free They need 68 feet fencing along with other security measures The fence cannot have any footholds for the wolf to climb because they can climb out of fenced in enclosuresYou also need to digproof the area you will keep the animal in Some LC will break free while some HC will stay in the fence It depends on how bad the animal wants to be free how bored they are and how much outside the fence excites them A large fenced in enclosure is ideal Wolves and wolf dogs need a lot of room to run and play   Wolves are social pack animals so they require canine companionship Just as important is socializing your wolf or wolf dog to people and places at a very young age This starts training the wolf or wolf dog to be around people in a domesticated setting   The wolf dog needs to be taken from its mother at 2 weeks old and bottle fed They need to immediately start being socialized to both male and female humans so they will be used to humans for the rest of their life Wolves need another canine for companionship and to meet their emotional needs You need to place the wolves with another canine of the opposite sex around the same size This ensures the wolf or wolf dog will not be lonely   You have to be the Alpha of your wolf When the animal is a puppy start training them to submit on cue This doesnt mean that the adult will always submit  wolves are very independent and selfassured But the wolf or wolf dog will know you are the Alpha and the one in charge   While training the pup never hit bite shout or pin or shake the puppy by the scruff Wolf parents dont punish their pups for chewing and biting they are very tolerant parents Try to refrain from physically dominating the wolf because this could damage the relationship Wolves exist on a meat diet Pure wolves and HC hybrids wont be able to exist on dry dog food Most wolves and wolf hybrids eat 25 pounds of meat daily   Venison is great for wolves You can feed them fresh roadkill deer but this requires a permit Wolves can get very bored which could result in them breaking free from their enclosure to find stimulation Build things inside their enclosure area to keep them active like platforms Wolves need to be mentally stimulated on a regular basisMake sure there are trees around and use old logs to hide treats inside Another good idea is providing swimming areas like water troughs swimming pools creeks or ponds for them to lay in and to dig inside Sandboxes or dirt piles are great for them to dig in Leash train them as pups so you can take them out on a leash You should use two leashes when you walk them  one on the collar or harness the other a slip leash You should walk them every day Most vets dont know how to care for wolves or wolf dogs Many will even refuse to provide treatment on these types of caninesMake sure to find a vet who will care for your wolf before you purchase one

Often the reason a horse objects to the bit is rooted in misunderstanding They arent usually trying to be naughty but something about the bit is making them uncomfortable   The bit might have the wrong taste Horses tend to prefer copper bits to other kinds of bits because of the taste Unfortunately copper bits tend to degrade more quickly than other kinds so you should make sure to watch out for pits and sharp edges The bit might be too cold You wouldnt want someone to shove a bit of cold metal in your mouth Neither does your horse Try warming up the bit between your hands before you put it in their mouth   Sometimes your horse wont open their mouth because the bit is too cold or has the wrong taste but often a little training can make it so they will do as you has Just make sure that you reinforce the behavior you want to see from them   Teach your horse to be comfortable with the cue Pick a cue to use to get your horse to open their mouth Give your horse the cue by touching them Say yes to them so that they associate that touch with good behavior Give your horse a treat as you take your fingers away Show your horse that they get a treat Have your horse tied or secured Approach the horses head from the left side and walk so that your horse can see you Stay on an angle facing the same direction as your horse Have a treat in your left hand Give your horse the cue and say Open while gently pressing two fingers again their lower lip Say yes and take your fingers away giving your horse the treat Repeat these steps about four or five times or until it seems like your horse has gotten the picture Now do as you did above only this time maintain slight but consistent pressure and place your fingers just under his upper lip When your horse opens their mouth say Yes and give them the treat Practice this until they get it Have your horse let you put a bit in their mouth Show your horse the bit unattached to the bridle to begin with Let your horse sniff it and lip it Then do as you did above giving your horse the cue Place the bit in your horses mouth when they open up Remove the bit and give them a treat   One of the keys to properly bridling your horse is to maintain calmness both in yourself and in your horse A nervous horse might try to bite toss their heads strike out with their hooves or try to escape If your horse is overly nervous dont bridle them until they have calmed down   Avoid flicking her with the reins especially around her eyes and ears because this can cause a horse to become nervous or anxious

Thereâs nothing a girl wants more than a guy who is obviously enjoying himself and completely happy on his own When youâre with your friends enjoy laughing and sharing stories When youâre walking to class think happy thoughts that put a smile on your face When you see her show her that youâre in a good mood and that youâre not a total downer You donât have to fake it obviously but you should let her see that youâre a person who is enjoying himself so she wants to be in your orbit   If she sees you already having a great time then sheâll want to be a part of what you have to offer If she thinks you need a girl to have a good time then sheâll think that youâre not quite happy with yourself  Gentlemen are all too hard to come by these days and if you are one girls will take notice You donât have to wear a stuffy suit or act all formal just to show a basic courtesy to women To be a gentleman treat women with respect by opening doors for them caring about how theyâre feeling when youâre around them and generally not being too vulgar or burping or being crude in their presence Every girl wants to be treated like a lady and you donât want to make it feel forced to be a real gentleman   Many guys you know may not have the greatest manners or politeness skills Stand out from the pack by having good manners and by being polite both to the girl and the people around you   Girls love confident guys and naturally gravitate towards them If you want the girl to really go crazy for you then you have to let her see how much you love being who you are Be happy to just be in the moment enjoy the time you spend with your friends and just let her see that youâre happy and secure with the person who you are and that you donât care about what other people think Many guys are obviously insecure and girls donât like that they donât want to spend their time building you up If youâre happy with who you are then the girl will be much more likely to want to be around you   This doesnât mean that you have to love every last thing about yourself It does mean that you should be aware of your flaws trying to change the ones you can change and accepting the ones you canât You donât have to act overly macho or brag about how awesome you are to come off as truly confident In fact this will be a turnoff for girls   Though girls need guys who have time for them they donât want guys who have nothing going on except them either If you want the girl to go crazy for you then you have to impress her with how cool and independent you are You should be happy doing your own thing whether itâs playing your guitar on the quad or going for a run in the park If youâre a follower and just try to do what everyone else is doing because you canât think for yourself then sheâll be able to tell Instead impress her with your ability to think for yourself and to be comfortable on your own   Though a girl wants a guy who can have a great time in a crowd she doesnât want someone who is completely bored on his own either   Donât open up to her about every little thing youâre thinking right away As you get to know the girl sure you can reveal a little bit about yourself but at first you donât have to tell her about how much you love your dog Munchkin or about your fight with your best friend Let her see that itâs worth it to get to know you because itâll make you open up little by little If she thinks itâs too easy to get to know you then she wonât see you as a challenge While you donât have to lie to her or make up excuses to be mysterious you should avoid telling her everything all at one   If you have to go donât tell her that you have to go meet your mom Leave her to wonder about your plans   Nothing makes girls go crazier than a guy who is great a guitar who has an amazing singing voice or who is unstoppable when it comes to basketball To put it bluntly talent is hot If you want to amaze and impress a girl then yeah it helps if youâre really good at something That doesnât mean that you should brag about it or show off in front of her or anything It just means that you should work to be really good at something and lead her to find out about it   Of course you shouldnât just pursue an activity or a passion just to impress girls but because you care about it Being really good at something will also boost your selfesteem which will also be great for impressing the girls   Stop thinking that the only way a girl will go crazy for you is if you keep bragging and talking about how awesome you are at various activities If you really are great at something then sheâll get word of it if you feel like you have to tell her then it means that youâre insecure and feel like you have to convince people about how amazing you are You can talk about the things you love to do but donât say things like âIâm the best atââ or âI just killed it whenââ or the girl will get bored and will start rolling her eyes   If youâre always showing off and talking about how awesome you are then girls will start to see you as social poison Nobody wants to be around guys who are always talking about themselves   This doesnt mean you have to spend all of your spare time at the gym working on those guns It does mean that you should make an effort to think about how you look before you step out of the house making sure youre showered smell nice have wellfitting clothes and that you dont look super scruffy unless thats part of your look If you look like you just rolled out of bed then the girl will wonder why she should spend time caring about you if you barely care about yourself You dont need to look like a model to show a girl that youve made an effort to look decent   If youre hanging out with a girl its common courtesy to show up looking nice Otherwise shell take your lack of effort personally   If you want a girl to go crazy for you then you have to actually have a reputation for being a nice person This doesnt mean you should let people walk all over you or that you should be nice to people who are mean to you but it does mean that you should treat everyone around you from the less cool kids in your school to your teachers or the girl who works at your local grocery store with a base level of respect Dont just be nice to the cool people and treat everyone else like dirt treat all of the people around you like equals and girls will be impressed that youre a good person with a kind heart   Contrary to what you think putting people down and gossiping wont really win girls over If youre always being negative about or to other people then the girls will feel like they cant really trust you   Girls love guys who can make them laugh and who are comfortable enough with themselves to be able to make jokes at their own expense This doesnt mean you have to sound insecure or selfdeprecating but if you find an opportunity to poke fun at yourself and to make her laugh in the process then go for it Shell think its cool that youre not obsessing over impressing her or making her think youre perfect and shell begin to open up to you and want to be around you more   If you get easily offended or mad when anyone else pokes fun at you youll come off as insecure and defensive Learn to take a joke and the ladies will be impressed   One of the biggest mistakes guys make is to spend so much time talking about themselves or worrying about themselves that they never stop and realize that thereâs a girl standing in front of them You may even make the innocent mistake of thinking too hard about what to say to impress a girl to have the time to consider what sheâs saying to you That stops now Instead take the time to really listen to her to let her finish talking instead of interrupting and to make an effort to really understand what sheâs trying to say instead of trying to relate everything back to yourself   Itâs really hard for girls to find a good listener If you can be a good listener this will definitely make you stand out as someone who genuinely cares for her   A little bit of flirting can go a long way If you want to get the ladies then you have to know how to flirt with them without going over the top Just be fun and light and playful making harmless jokes and teasing them a little bit and keep the conversation and banter going in a fun lighthearted way Donât make overly sexual comments or insult the girl when youâre really just trying to tease her instead give her cute compliments and even laugh at yourself a little bit to make her see that you like her and donât take the whole flirting thing too seriously   Of course if you want one special girl you should give her most of your flirting energy while occasionally flirting with others to keep it interesting you donât want her to think that youâre just a big flirt who flirts with everybody and doesnât really care about her   If you want the girl to go crazy over you then it helps a lot if her friends think youâre the best thing since sliced bread If youâre only nice to the girl you like and are kind of mean to the rest of her friends then sheâll get word of it and will think that you donât really care about people But if you charm her friends without flirting with them or giving them the wrong idea then sheâll get word of how nice of a guy you are and will undoubtedly like you even more   When girls hear other girls talking about how awesome a guy is then they get jealous which makes them like that guy even more   If you want a girl to go crazy for you then you have to make her feel special by actually taking the time to recognize her as a unique individual Tell her âYouâre not like other girlsââ or âYouâre so different from your friendsââ and make her see that she really does stand out to you You can give her a specific compliment about her personality or mention something she said in a previous conversation to show that youâre listening and that you do care Donât do this to every girl though or it will get back to her and itâll look like youâre just a player Girls want to feel unique and if they can find a guy who makes them feel that way theyâll be all in   Take the time to really notice the things that make the girl stand out whether itâs her confidence her laugh or her talent at dancing Let her know why sheâs special   Though you want to win the girl over you have to keep up the chase You donât want her to think that she has you in the palm of her hand but that she has to do some work to win you over too It should be a mutual thing Let her know you like her but donât shower her with compliments Hang out with her but make sure you have plans with other friends too and that you arenât available the second she wants to hang out If she calls you stop picking up the second the phone rings youâve got other things to do right This will keep the girl interested in coming back for more   This doesnât mean that you have to play elaborate games to win the girl over It does mean that you should keep things interesting so thereâs never a dull moment when she sees you If you put it all out there sheâll be less likely to be crazy about the intriguing awesome guy that you are   You dont want to become that obsessive possessive guy every girl is afraid of but you also dont want to be Mr Aloof Whether youre in a relationship with a girl or just starting to hang out texting her every once in a while to ask how her day is going or to ask how her math test or soccer game went will show that youre thinking about her even when youre not together This will make her see that youre a guy worth keeping around Just make sure that youre not always the one to check in first or she may feel a bit smothered   Dont text her to say hi more than once every other day or so You dont want her to think that you have nothing better to do than to be in touch with her   The best way to win a girl over is not to rush it and just to enjoy the moment instead of trying to find the best fifty ways to be the coolest guy ever As corny as it sounds at the end of the day you want the girl to like you not some overdone fake version of who you are so you should focus on having the girl get to know the real you and getting to know the real her in the process   If you spend all your time trying to impress the girl trying to play hard to get or generally behaving in a way that just doesnt feel natural to you then shell catch on pretty fast Instead relax charm the girl and get ready for her to go crazy for you
Keeping these objects will only make you miss your ex more and more For example if you have a picture frame of a wonderful day that you had at your favorite place you can place that frame out of your reach until youve gotten over your ex but dont throw it away you will probably regret it in the future   You should also avoid visiting any places that remind you of your ex whether it be a local park or the skating center Visiting these places will only make you even more depressed   If you previously maintained contact with him or her on social media unfriendunfollow and block him or her If you have your exs phone number remove it from your contacts Refrain from texting calling emailing or using any way of keeping in touch with him or her If you try to keep in contact with your ex this could upset him or her and it is not worth it since the two of you already broke up   For example if he or she always goes to Gameworks avoid going to Gameworks If you suddenly run into your ex it could be very awkward   If there are alternative ways of getting to class where you wouldnt have to worry about running into each other use one of those ways If you cant avoid your ex at any cost remain friendly but dont say much when you see him or her A simple hi is okay but refrain from chatting casually on the way to class   Those friends will probably not wish to discuss this topic and asking about your ex will only make you want him or her back more
Or fake it till you make itââjust thinking about being more confident can help even if you dont actually feel this way Think of who you are and if your crush likes you the way you are they will accept you Having confidence is one of the key ways to get your crushs attention Not having enough confidence will show through your words and actions Be proud of who you are   Stand up straight Good posture will trick your brain into thinking youre confident  Your crush may not like you if you pretend to be someone youre not Plus it gets tiring to have to put on an act every day Your personality should shine through your words Never be ashamed of who you are  dont try to hide yourself   Conversations can be easily started with just a simple sentence All it takes is bravery and confidence in yourself If you are passing in the hallways just try to get the courage to greet them and softly smile There is nothing more powerful than a genuine acknowledging smile Eye contact is also very important in this step   If you have a crush on a girl compliment her on things she does in class as well or something you know she did like an event or win an award It will mean a lot more to her if you complement her actions rather than her outfit or hair You should show an interest in their personality not just their looks If you have a crush on a guy you might want to compliment their looks and outfits if you really like an item of clothing they wear well like a hat compliment it or focus on something they did For example you could say Hey that presentation you did in class was great or You did great at yesterdays soccer game Things like this will boost their ego and make them feel great about themselves   Read some blogs or check the news Read magazines books watch TV have adventures listen to different music and watch different movies If you expand your knowledge to a variety of topics youll have lots to talk about with your crush   If they enjoy a hobby that you dont refrain from lying and telling them you like it also Your crush will eventually discover the truth and their opinion of you will diminish   Never give your crush mean looks or anything to draw attention unless they know youre joking with them When you do tease or joke with them make sure its obvious and that you dont really mean it However too much teasing may lead to hurt feelings and a sour relationship Keep your teasing to a minimum and lighthearted tease them only about things you know that they wont mind Keep away from touchy topics   If you have any bad habits while talking to your crush youll be at a downside Try to be yourself but refrain from cursing excessively calling everything retarded etc Keep your conversations innocent clean but entertaining in a positive way   After talking to crush a lot finally come out with saying you like them but dont say the exact line Your line should be something like a hint but big and clear enough that your crush will get the point and understand Come up with something original   Hey uhIve been talking a lot with you because I like you Hi nice to see you again um look I like you Hey I gotta tell you something I maybe um sorta kinda like you a little bit Uh hi um okay I know Im shy and all but I have feelings for you something like that might work Hey um look I have to tell you something and you might like it or might not sigh I like you Hi um look I think youre a cool person Im sure theres someone that likes you out there will be good enough see tips for more suggestions  Refrain from sounding like you have practiced the line One to three um or ah will make it sound more natural  stick them in appropriate places Try not to use um and ah too much It will make your crush think that youre far too shy When confessing your crush on them let them know about it with confidence Everyone likes someone with confidence  the more confidence the better However be careful about having too much confidence Have eye contact when youre telling your crush you like himher It will make you appear more confident and it makes you look bold     However if your crush doesnt feel the same about you its fine There are plenty of other fish in the sea The right person is out there waiting for you to come around the corner If you never get past this event you will never find your true love Move on
Most sites say to keep in contact with them but I found that if I talked to them and looked at their pictures I started missing them again So try to have as little contact as possible If you go to work or school with them I suggest to only have casual conversation with them as best you can try not to become friends with them again yet  So dont be insecure DONT BE DESPERATE be confident try to get on with your life get a new hobby and other things that make you feel good   And yes guys that means that new watch those underwear she thought you looked cute in pictures you took together whatever By getting rid of those reminders you will be able to put new reminders up of family friends or maybe someone new   Or smaller things but still effective like going shopping trying new foods have a party or get together Just have fun with the people you want to be with dont force yourself to be happy Its only natural to be sad and you dont just get over it quickly take your time but dont stop your life because of them   My favorite part about writing a journal is rereading it again seeing my progress with getting over the personYou really feel like you have accomplished something and you will always remember them just not in a sad way like you miss them but more in a way that your happy for the experience with that person   So ask their friends about them and see the real reason they didnt want to be with you anymore or how they felt when you left them If you feel ready and brave enough I suggest you do it yourself Dont ask them right away or in the next week after the breakup but when you know you are over them maybe even in a month or so Then they will also feel confident to tell you because they understand what they feel as well   So now is the time to reconnect with them as friends JUST FRIENDS Not friends with benefits Once you feel close enough in a matter of maybe weeks or even months ask them how they felt about how your relationship ended or any other questions you might have had about your past relationship Then remind them that you are happy that they are just friends now and be excited for the rest of your life   I know you might feel like they deserve it but you dont have to stoup to their level
Catch the eye of the girl you like whether youâre in class or at a social gathering outside of school Try to hold her gaze for as long as possible and remember to smile while doing so   If youâre shy or nervous and find it difficult to hold eye contact try just catching her eye for a short period of time before looking away Or look at the center of her forehead or nose for the same effect if thatâs easierAvoid getting caught looking too much and getting distracted in class by making eye contact just a couple times per class period  Try to smile at the girl you like as much as possible whether youâre passing her by in the hall catch her attention in class or you get to talk to her Let her know youâre friendly and interested in interacting her with just a simple smile whenever you look at her   Smiles are contagious Chances are that sheâll smile back at you if you smile first so youâve got nothing to lose Be clean and fresh whenever you get to see or talk to her Shower frequently to wash your body and hair brush your teeth use mouthwash and put on deodorant   If you choose to wear cologne or a highly scented deodorant or body spray note that less is more You donât want the girl you like to notice you because sheâs revolted by an overwhelming smell of cologne   Choose clean clothes without a lot of wrinkles to wear to school or other places where youâll see the girl you like You donât need to be extra stylish just wear something comfortable thatâs not stained or torn and fits you well   You might not know her well yet but if you know she likes a certain band book or movie try wearing a tshirt that features it She might even strike up a conversation with you about it   Before you even work up the courage to talk to the girl you like you can project confidence in yourself that she will take notice of Have good posture with your head held held high and your shoulders back make eye contact with people and engage in whatâs going on around you   Confidence is very different from arrogance Be confident by knowing that you are successful and a pleasant person to be around without acting like you are the best in the universe To help you feel confident on the inside which will show on the outside make an effort to accept compliments when people give them to you Instead of brushing off your friendâs compliment of your shoes or shirt by saying âYeah whatever manâ just say âThanks dudeâ Also try making a list every day of five things large or small that you did well If youâre not quite ready to talk to her but still want her to notice you try slipping a sweet or funny note into her locker a school book or someplace else she will find it   You can leave your note or letter anonymous by signing it with a code name or word and tell her she has to figure out who it is through clues you give her in each letter Stick with a simple joke or compliment in your letters if you donât want to be too forward with your feelings right away   Observe her to see what kinds of books she reads music she listens to or teams she follows Try picking up a book by the same author or wearing a tshirt with the band or team she likes when youâre around her and she might just strike up a conversation about itEven if she doesnât start talking to you she will likely notice if youâre wearing reading or looking at something sheâs interested in too Smile if she looks over at you or even say âHey howâs it goingâ to start up a conversation Thereâs no need to snoop or be overly observant to find out the things she likes Just pay attention when you see her wearing reading or talking about something excitedly Chances are you already like some of the same things or would want to learn more about them   Start up a conversation more easily by having a question in mind to ask her You can start with âHey how are youâ or âHey howâs it goingâ but you can also be more specific with something like âHey did you catch what the homework was for English I missed itâ or âHey did I see you at last weekâs basketball gameâ   Donât be disappointed if your question doesnât lead to much of a conversation or if you blank out on what to say after the question you had in mind Just smile and thank her for talking to you before walking away Sheâll remember that you were nice and went out of your way to talk to her   If you strike up a conversation with her ask her questions about her family hobbies school movies books or sports and you are bound to find some things in common Say âI really like art tooâ or âI have a big family as well three older sisters and one younger brotherâ Sheâll remember these things and take more notice of you in the future   You can use subjects you find in common with her to strike up future conversations For example if youâre both into learning about bugs and insects you could bring a book you found on the subject to school and tell her âHey look I found this book with really cool pictures of beetles I thought youâd like since we had that conversation about how we both like bugsâ Remember to be honest and tell her true things about yourself Avoid the temptation to tell small lies or say you like something just because she likes it The truth will only come out and make you look bad later if she continues to talk to you and get to know you better   Let the girl know that youâre smart and funny by sharing fun facts participating with answers in class and telling jokes Share the things youâre knowledgeable about with her and tell her a new joke when you talk to her   Never downplay your intelligence or âplay dumbâ to get the attention of the girl you like or to seem cooler around your friends Avoid boasting about the things you know or trying too hard with silly jokes Just make funny observations engage in school and donât pretend to know a lot about something unless you really do   Give her your full attention and listen carefully when she talks to you to show her that you really care what she has to say Use polite language like âpleaseâ and âthank youâ when youâre asking her a question and wish her a good night or weekend when youâre parting ways   Kindness and respect can really make you stand out if other people she knows just try to tease her or end up being mean to get her attention Everyone likes to be listened to and respected and being mean is an immature way to get noticed Remember things she says that you can bring up in later conversations If she talks about a TV show she likes you can start another conversation the next week saying âHey did you see that there was a marathon of that show you like on TV yesterdayâ   Show you are more mature than other boys by not engaging in some of the things you might see other boys doing like teasing or taunting girls to get their attention Know that girls mature sooner than boys so even if youâre in sixth grade too a sixth grade girl may be going through changes that you donât know about yetNever tease a girl about her body or call her bad names that you hear on TV or from other boys The girl will not respond well or like you at all if you do these things Instead use respectful and polite language with her and give her compliments on aspects of her personality like her sense of humor or her taste in music rather than on her appearance If you talk to her about how you like her or ask to go on a date or start a relationship and she says no donât get upset or mad Respect her feelings and donât bug her about it Understand that she may not be ready for a relationship yet could have mixed feelings about you or just not have those feelings at allBe friends with the girl if sheâs not interested in dating or anything else with you   Join a club sport or other extracurricular activity that she does to spend more time around her and get to know her better Talk to her about the club or sport and even ask her for tips if youâre new and just learning about what youâre doing   Avoid joining in on everything that the girl is a part of as she might become suspicious or annoyed that youâre suddenly everywhere she goes Instead choose some of her activities that you are genuinely interested in getting involved with and learning more about   Join her at a table at lunch sit next to her in a class or another occasion during or after school You donât need to sit right next to her at lunch just at the same table and close enough that you can start a conversation and make eye contact with her   Start with a simple âHey can I sit hereâ Then you can move on to other easy topics like school subjects or a school dance coming up Donât be afraid to talk to everyone else at the table too and not just her   Talk to her friends individually or when theyâre in a group and get to know them by being kind asking questions and finding things in common just like you do with her Learn more about her through them and she will notice and feel comfortable around you when youâre friendly with all of her friends too   Donât worry about trying to get her alone and away from her friends if you always see her with them It might be hard to talk to her with others around but if you talk to everyone in the group not just her it will be a lot easier to feel comfortable with them and get chances later to catch her oneonone   When youâre in a group or sitting together stand or sit near her so you can be ready to start a conversation Donât violate her personal space or boundaries or touch her without permission but you can let her know youâre there with a wave or come up closer to talk to her   If you donât want to get too close to her you can still subtly mimic her body language to send a signal that youâre paying attention to her If she crosses her arms leans her head on her hand or stands with her hands in her pockets while sheâs talking to you wait at least 20 seconds and do the same or something similar Donât engage in teasing or taunting behavior that you might see other boys doing to get a girlâs attention she will not like you or be interested in you at all Never touch her or her stuff without asking first tease her with names or say anything about her body Treat her with respect and be kind to her if you want her attention   You can get suspended or expelled from school or get into other major trouble for touching or harassing a girl so donât do it Even calling her names or teasing her when youâre chatting on the computer or texting is wrong could get you in trouble and should never be done Donât follow what you learn on TV or movies from video games or other boys your age or older if they talk about calling girls certain names or making any comments about how a girlâs body has changed or how it looks Call a girl by her own name or what she prefers to be called and say nice things to her preferably about her personality rather than how she looks Be friends with a girl if sheâs not interested in dating or anything else with you Also listen to what she says and leave her alone entirely if she asks you to

Does he stare at you a lot or look at you when talking to friends Text you a lot If so he might like you keep reading if youre still not positive  Make sure you keep him interested If you think acting ignorant will make him run to you youre wrong   Texting is a way you can release your feelings without the awkwardness of talking oneonone If your conversation suddenly stops with a Yeah wait a little bit to see if he tries to continue the conversation If he does he might be interested   However make sure that he will not feel uncomfortable because of your overly big interest in his friends instead of him   Get to know him So that way you connect which will make him like you more   If so this could be because he likes hanging out with you   Hugging is a big sign that he may have some interest in you or he is just a friendly guy It really depends on the hug If its a sweet hug from behind while you are your locker resting his head on your shoulder it means he wants a proper hug but doesnt want to ask you If its a hug where he lifts you and spins you around he is definitely into you He just wants to gain your trust first and get to know you more Even if he just pokes tickles taps or bump in to you that can show you that he is definitely trying to flirt this may sound weird but sometimes when a boys likes a girl he will be mean to her so maybe he playfully trips you or pushesshoves you thats a sign as well For example if you and your crush are playing soccer together he might brush up against your arm thus using his body language to hint his attraction to you   When he smiles at you when you do something cute or something clumsy he will look at you and laugh softly If you say something funny or youre in class and you say I dont get it and that pulls on his heartstrings he will laugh softly and poke your nose softly as if saying I like your nose Go crosseyed as if your trying to look at your nose immediately after he pokes your nose It will make him laugh and think you are so much cuter
If you want to make your guy friend date you then youve already set a solid foundation for your relationship But if youre not really friends with the guy yet then befriending him can help you show him that you like him If you dont know the guy at all and he barely knows who you are itll be tougher to show him your true feelings Also getting to know him as a friend will help you see if youre really compatible and will give you a chance to show him how awesome you are in a lowpressure setting   Start by being friendly You shouldnt ask him to hang out or reveal your most intimate thoughts to him right away Just take it easy and start building a fun and friendly rapport with him Ease into the friendship Dont overwhelm the guy by always being around Just slowly start increasing the amount of time you spend with each other Dont fall into the Friend Zone You should try to be his friend but dont develop such a deep friendship that itll get weird if you try to take things to a romantic level   If you want to get to know the guy you can start talking about all of the things you have in common from your families to your favorite sports teams If you dont have so much in common you can learn from each other and may find yourself picking up on some of his interests And if you want to pretend to care a little more about his favorite sports team than you really do then thats okay too   Most guys love talking about sports If you both like the same sports team or sport you can talk about it if not you can read up on his favorite team and casually drop some facts Use music as a common bond See if you have any of the same favorite bands  if not ask if he has any recommendations for you If youve developed your friendship enough you can even make him a CD of your favorite music to grab his attention Talk about your families Keep it light and talk about your siblings or any pets you have or had growing up See if you like the same type of food If he finds out that you love sushi too hell be more likely to ask you to go to the new sushi bar in your neighborhood   Find a common thing that the two of you can laugh about whether its the fact that one of your mutual friends never matches or the creepy poster in the back of your math class Whatever reason you both have for laughing youll develop a deeper bond with the guy and will show him how much fun you can be   If you find something that the two of you can laugh about then this will create a little inside joke and will make you grow closer You can even find the same pet peeve to laugh about If theres an annoying teacher you both cant stand or if you both hate a certain pop music star you can have a good laugh over this together   The way to a mans heart is through the respect of his friends If you get his friends to love you then hell be much more likely to love you too Hanging out and being nice to his friends will show him that youre a cool person who can get along with anyone and it will also let him see that youre showing more of an interest in him If you didnt care about him then you wouldnt care about his friends   You should get to know his friends but make sure youre not always around especially during dudecentric events   Once you get to know him a bit you can offer to give him a ride or to pick up lunch if he looks like he needs a favor If you cant do that offer to carry something for him Though this will be a small gesture of friendship hell also begin to see that you really care about him Just make sure that hes offering to help you out from time to time too so the relationship isnt all onesided   If he misses class offer to take notes for him or to drop them off If youre picking up coffee on the way to meet him ask if he wants something too Just remember to not overdo it Youre not his girlfriend yet so you shouldnt offer to do his laundry or grocery shopping   If youve been friends for a while and are hanging out more then itll be natural to ask for his number You should play it cool and not ask for it like youre asking him to go out on a date Instead just ask him for his number so you can text him about when everyone is meeting at the bar send him details to your party or whatever If hes a nice guy he wont say no or think its weird   Getting his number will increase the amount of contact you have with him Now you can start chatting through text and can take your relationship to a new level Once you do get his number make sure that youre not the only one calling and texting him
Keep the conversation light and fun   If in doubt ask questions about her Ask her where shes from whos she on vacation with and what sort of things shes seen since she got here All of these questions can lead to positive conversations   If youre out on vacation there should be a wide range of activities available to you Whether its swimming hiking partying or seeing a show you should keep the activities onthego and exciting   When one activity ends start up another This will show the girl that you are fun and spontaneous   If youre looking to meet a woman abroad you should take advantage of this excitement This is especially true if the woman is out vacationing herself While you interact with her dont hesitate or be afraid of potentially making a fool of yourself Because you may only know this girl for a short amount of time there are far fewer repercussions than if you were approaching someone domestically   You can just as easily share these things with someone you just recently met Whether its going to a resort club taking a long swim or watching a tropical sunset together the girl will associate positive feelings with you as she shares worthwhile experiences with you   Here are some of the things you should keep an eye out for if youre trying to figure out if shes interested   If shes messaging you frequently throughout the vacation its a good sign that shes interested in seeing more of you Shes likely interested in pursuing things with you if she singles you out in a crowd or spends more time with you than the party she originally came on vacation with Typical body language signs of attraction like twirling hair and sustained eye contact should also be taken into account in this instance although you should consider potential differences in culture Women from certain cultures will manifest their attraction in more subtle ways than what youre used to dealing with   Although you shouldnt jump in the second you meet a girl you shouldnt wait to make your feelings and intentions known to her If you feel youve arrived at an appropriate time jump on the chance and see what happens   If it turns out that the girl isnt interested in you you shouldnt take it to heart Vacation romances seldom work out as it is and any pain you feel will be lessened by the time you get back home   Although part of this is the impression that someone wont be judged if shes away from the people she knows its still paramount that you approach any potential sexual encounter with safety in mind Failing to do so could result in sexually transmitted diseases or even pregnancy
If you want to attract an older woman then confidence is absolutely key If youre a teen then youre probably still figuring out who you are who your friends are what you want to do with your life and how you fit in Thats all fine but when you see or hang out with the older woman this stuff shouldnt come to the forefront Instead you should show her the positive thoughts you have about yourself Hey you may still be figuring it out but you love who you are you love hanging out with other people and you love having a good time   If she sees you noticing her stand tall and proud Show the woman that youre comfortable with yourself instead of trying to fit in all the time You should speak clearly make eye contact and act like you know what youre talking about  even if you dont Its natural to have insecurities and as you get to know the woman or older girl you can bring those out but you should come out strong out of the gate Remember your competition  older guys who are in college or who are maybe even starting their careers If the woman sees that youre still struggling to find yourself shell move on  Being assertive means that youre comfortable enough with yourself to know what you want and to be okay with telling people what you want Instead of being wishy washy or unsure you should be clear about your needs  whether its that you want to get to know her you want to take her out or that you have a great idea for a date Though you should respect her age and wisdom dont defer to her all the time just because shes older or shell start to think that you dont have much to contribute   Once you see the woman you like let her see you notice her Dont be shy about it You can even smile at her or approach her if the timing is right Dont cower in the corner Just come up to her even if its only to say hi If you want to be assertive you have to say what you mean and mean what you say Be clear even if youre only introducing yourself Its okay to get nervous but try to minimize fidgeting stumbling over your words or looking at the floor because shes too beautiful   It may be hard to get experience when youre only sixteen years old but every little thing you do counts This doesnt mean that you should try to hook up with as many girls as possible or to backpack across Europe to understand what life is really all about It does mean that you should do what you can to broaden your horizons so the older woman will see that you have depth and that you have some things to teach her too If she constantly feels like she knows everything and has to train you to be an adult then things will get old fast Here are some ways to get some experience   Travel Spend your summer or even your spring break traveling to a new place whether its to Costa Rica on a service trip or just to visit a relative a few states away The more places you see and people you meet the more youll see that the world is bigger than your own backyard or hometown Date You shouldnt date girls just to get experience but dating even a girl or two can help you understand how to deal with women and can also help you get some experience when it comes to hooking up An older woman will be less likely to date you if its obvious that youve never even had another girlfriend because thats a big burden for her to take on Immerse yourself in a variety of activities You may love baseball but if baseball is the only thing you know and love you may run out of things to talk about with the older woman pretty quickly Spend your Sundays volunteering join the French culture club or school paper or just do a few things that can help you develop a passion about a variety of subjects   Again though it may be difficult to feel or act mature when youre a teenager youll have to do your best to impress the woman Women already mature a bit faster than men and the difference in your maturity levels may be more noticeable if youre a few years  or more  younger than the woman You should work on controlling your moods having reasonable reactions to disappointing or upsetting situations and minimizing your vulgar language fart jokes and other loud noises that may go over well with your buddies on the football team   Part of being mature is being in control of your feelings Let the woman see that you dont get easily angry or upset or shell think youre throwing a temper tantrum Another part of being mature is to not complain about every little thing If you complain about the minor things that irk you the woman will think that you dont have the good sense to appreciate all of the wonderful things in your life Avoid gossiping about your friends or other people the woman may know She may love to gossip too but try not to do it too much especially at first or shell think that youre not mature enough to respect people who arent in the room Be polite to everyone you see If you take her out be polite to servers and anyone else you encounter This is a big sign of maturity
Is she looking you in the eyes longer or glancing at you when youre not looking This is usually an indication that someone is attracted to you  This can range from subtle gestures like letting an arm rest against you to more obvious ones like an extended hug Either way consistent physical contact isnt something you typically do with your platonic friends Its probably a good sign   Does she seem to get upset when youre around other girls or try to jump into every conversation you have with one Shes probably jealous of the attention that theyre getting from you This is a clear indicator she wants to be more than friends
Boars are male guinea pigs If a female guinea pig has been in the presence of a boar then she will have almost certainly tried to mate and has a high chance of becoming pregnant   Male guinea pigs can impregnate a female at as young as 3 weeks old and a female guinea pig can become pregnant at as young as 4 weeks old so dont be doubtful if your guinea pig is pregnant due to age  A pregnant sow will begin to drink and eat more as the pregnancy advances She may eat up to triple the amount she usually consumes She may also drink more water than normal Keep in mind that normal is relative to your guinea pigs usual habits   However do not assume that your guinea pig is pregnant based on just how much she is eating or drinking All animals for example tend to eat more when its cold when theyre having a growth spurt and when theyre suffering from certain illnesses A female guinea pigs weight will increase significantly if shes pregnant Guinea pigs typically weigh about 152 lbsIn general by the end of a pregnancy the pregnant guinea pigs weight will have doubled the piglets usually make up more than half of the sows weight   A good idea is to weigh your female guinea pig regularly perhaps weekly and to record the weight This way you can keep track of her weight in order to determine any patterns of weight gain that may be indicative of a pregnancy However if your sow is not yet mature and is less than 68 months of age she will still be growing and thus weight gain may not be indicative of pregnancy   If you feel your guinea pigs womb very carefully you may be able to detect the fetuses if she is pregnant Usually you can identify the fetuses in her womb from around 2 weeks after mating Treat the sow with care and never handle her roughly When feeling your guinea pigs abdomen never apply pressure or squeeze the area since this could harm both the piglets and the sowTo feel for fetuses place the sow on a towel on a firm surface This will keep your guinea pig from slipping With your nondominant hand hold her steady around the shoulders with her head facing away from you Use your dominant hand to feel her belly Begin by making a C shape with your thumb and first finger and then sliding the thumb over the top of her tummy and the forefinger underneath her belly Gently press inwards and see if you feel any lumps or bumps inside her tummy If pregnant your guinea pig may have a single piglet or up to 34 If several fetuses are present you will feel several bumps spaced across her tummy each of a similar size However be aware that other things can feel like bumps in the abdomen The kidney bladder or even fecal pellets can all be easily mistaken for fetuses Bumps can also indicate ovarian cysts or tumors If you feel something and youre not certain what it is then consult your veterinarian
If youre asking yourself whether you have a crush on a guy and care enough to do some research on the topic then chances are you probably do You may be secondguessing yourself because the guy is an old friend or an unlikely target for your affection or because youre just plain confused   But dont overthink it  having a crush on someone doesnt mean you want him to be your soul mate It just means you like him and want to spend more time around him  This is another easy way to tell if you have a crush on him Why would you spend a lot of time thinking about a guy if he wasnt special to you If you find yourself thinking about the guy every few hours or just wondering what the guy is up to all the time then you probably have a crush on him Here are some ways to tell if your thoughts say you have a crush   If you catch yourself daydreaming about the guy in class If you think about the guy as you drift off to sleep Bonus points if you ever dream about him even if it isnt in a romantic way If you find yourself always wondering what the guy is doing or what hes up to If youre always wondering what the guy would think about certain things What would he think of your new dress your new haircut the movie you just saw or the restaurant you just tried Notice how often you think about the guy each day Once a day Maybe not Once an hour Probably a crush   A lack of concentration is another surefire sign that you have a crush on a guy If youre completely focused on yourself your grades and your friends then you dont have time to think about a crush But if you can barely read a page of your book for homework because your thoughts keep drifting to him then this is a sign that you are crushing hard   If youre feeling so distracted by the thought of your guy that you cant even hold a conversation with one of your friends for more than five minutes then you have a crush If you cant read more than a paragraph of your homework assignment without picturing your guys face or wondering if he did his homework then you have a crush If you find yourself drifting off with thoughts of your guy in the middle of a movie or even during a thirtyminute TV show then you have a crush If youre so distracted that you cant focus on taking notes in class and find yourself doodling the guys name then you are definitely crushing   Chances are this isnt your first crush so think of another guy youve crushed on in the past and compare it to that Though no two relationships or crushes are the same if youve thought about a different crush the same way before then chances are this guy is your new crush   Try to remember if you thought about a different crush this way before What kind of thoughts did you have If youre having similar thoughts about a new boy toy then its likely that you have a crush Know your crushing style Were you also in denial when you were falling for your previous crush If so then this is a sign that this is your way of easing into a crush If youve never had a crush then you may not have anything to compare your crush to If this is the case then you probably do have a crush and just dont know what it feels like

Like most pets guinea pigs can learn to come to you when called with a little practice and motivation in the form a treat Make sure you use your guinea pigâs name often and address her by name when you feed her and give her treats   You can also practice getting her to come to you when called by taking her out of her cage and placing her a few feet away from you Call her by name and hold out one of her favorite treats Your guinea pig should be motivated to run to you When she does so give her a treat as a reward Practice this at least once a day and over time she should come to you when called by name outside her cage and inside her cage  This is another simple command you can teach your guinea pig using a treat   Hold a treat above your guinea pigâs head so she has to stand on her back legs to get to it Say the command âStand upâ and then let her have the treat once she is on her back legs Repeat this command once a day on a consistent basis Over time your guinea pig will stand up when you command her even when you are not holding a treat   You can practice this command with your guinea pig when she is in her cage or outside of her cage   Hold a treat in your hand and let your guinea pig approach you When she is in front of you move your hand so you make a circle and say the command âCircleâ Your guinea pig should follow the motion of your hand with the treat and make a circle Once she makes a circle give her the treat Repeat this once a day until she can circle on command without the treat   Use a ball that is not too heavy and not too big like a tennis ball so your guinea pig can maneuver it easily You will also need a treat that is long and flat like a carrot stick   Place the carrot stick on the ground and then put the tennis ball on top of the carrot stick Encourage your guinea pig to try to push the ball off the treat so she can access the treat and say âPush the ballâ Repeat these steps and over time you should be able to remove the treat so she learns to push the ball on her own without the treat   You will need a hoop that is about 6â  10â in diameter or you can use pipe cleaners to form a hoop that is close to that size The top of an ice cream tub or a tennis racket without the strings would also work Make sure that whatever you use as a hoop there are no sharp edges or anything your guinea pig can get stuck on as she learns to jumpBegin by holding the hoop so it touches the ground or the bottom of your guinea pigâs cage Hold a treat on one side of the hoop or have someone help you by holding the treat as you hold the hoop Call your guinea pigâs name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop Say the command âThrough the hoopâ You may need to give your guinea pig a nudge or a gentle push to convince her to jump through the hoop Over time she will be motivated enough by the treat to jump through the hoop and get it Praise her and give her the treat when she goes through the hoop Repeat these steps until your guinea pig starts to go through the hoop on her own without the motivation of the treat   Many guinea pig owners teach their pets to go to the bathroom in a litter box However this takes a lot of patience and practice When you are first litter box training your guinea pig be prepared for some accidents and do not scold or punish your guinea pig if this happens Your guinea pig will respond more to positive reinforcement and acknowledgementTo litter train your guinea pig place a litter box in the spot in her cage where she goes to the bathroom often Place a handful of hay in the box and a few fecal pellets When you notice your guinea pig using the litter box give her a treat as praise Over time she will understand that using the litter box is a good thing that leads to treats and she will start to use it on a regular basis
Nothing says youâre interested in her more than taking the time to make her something It could be something as small as a bouquet of wildflowers you picked yourself and put in a homemade vase Really its the thought and the surprise that count You could also make her a braided bracelet out of yarn or beads Another option is baking her something like a batch of cookies or brownies   If she talks about a particular band that youâve never heard find it and listen to it She will probably be impressed that you went to the trouble of listening to it Bring her things she mentions If she said she likes coffee bring her coffee one day Show her that you are getting to know the real girl and her likes and dislikes Also pay attention when she tells a story It says something about her and shell be touched if you remember it later It doesnât have to be big but it should be thoughtful She should know that youâve been thinking about her It should also show that you know the kinds of things she likes and likes to do In other words it should be thoughtfulIf she collects things like stickers pins pens or hair bows bring her a new one that you know shell like If she likes to read pick a used book to give to her You could also bring her a piece of chocolate or her favorite soda   It doesnât have to be fancy just something that will be new and surprising and bring a smile to her face Think about the kinds of activities she likes and come up with a plan In fact you could even ask some questions to figure out what she likes without giving away the surprise such as So what are some of your favorite restaurants in town I love Bettys BurgersVisit a free art gallery or go have coffee and dessert at a coffee shop Take a walk by the lake to feed the ducks Join a free dancing lesson or go browse the library together
The first thing youve got to do is make yourself the kind of person that people notice and want to be around This is the best way to get and keep your crushs attention Get up off the couch and start doing things with your life This will give you something to be proud about something to talk about and show others the full complex person that you are If heshe says that youre ugly ask himher the truth somewhere private   You can volunteer pick up a new hobby join a club get a job or any number of other activities Everyone loves it when one of their friends has the same interests as them Just make sure to only join activities you want to join and dont be forced to do something you dont want to   No one wants to deal with someone whos always complaining or who constantly says bad things about other people Instead of only seeing the bad things in life bring out the good in everything and everyone around you Find the positive spin or lessons to be learned from bad situations Your crush will notice and feel much better about your positive personality   No one wants to date someone who might say bad things about them or be mean to them Show your crush Â thats not you by being nice not only to them but to everyone around you Help people always have a kind word for someone who needs one compliment people and find other ways to be nice too If they look bad or you dont like their shoes Just tell them politely or just dont look at their clothes For example smile and be friendly And just be yourself around them   Take care of your body This shows that you care about and value yourself showing others that you are worth caring about and valuing Wear clean clothes with no holes or stains wash your hair and body regularly take good care of your skin and exercise as much as you can Your crush wont want to be around you if you dont look or smell nice   You want your crush to like you for who you are so always be yourself Dont change yourself or try to be someone youre not People can usually tell and youll only make yourself frustrated and sad Dont let a crush change who you are Do the things that you enjoy and if anyone doesnt like it then they arent worth your timeWho knows maybe heshe likes it when you act like yourself   Everyone likes someone whos confident This is a very attractive quality for boys and girls Of course you dont have to actually be confident Most people arent even if they seem like they are Treat yourself well dont constantly apologize to everyone and get out there and do the things that make you you   Some great clothes will certainly capture attention Wear clothes that fit the current fashions but also are flattering to your coloring and the shape of your body You dont have to break the bank either Try resale or thrift shops in trendy areas or nearby colleges or universities for stylish clothes on the cheap side   Dont be clingy or desperate This will make your crush think you have issues they really dont want to deal with Instead put on an air of cool If they dont seem like they want to talk to you go talk to someone else Throw parties and dont invite them until the last minute Show them that you have your own life and that your world doesnt revolve around cataloging every time they so much as sneeze   You dont want to intimidate your crush Maybe they already like you but theyre worried youll blow them off or bite their head off if they try to talk to you or ask you out Be friendly dont overreact to things and definitely dont act like a jerk if someone else that you dont like asks you out on a date   Let them see you talking to and hanging out with other members of the gender you prefer to date They need to see that you have other options and that you know you have other options This will make you more desirable   Of course the best way to get their attention is to talk to them They might not even know you exist if youre too shy so get out there and have a conversation with them Ask them about what theyre doing this weekend or how their day went Ask them about things youre doing in school or their opinion on the latest football match Anything that gets the two of you talking is great   No one is going to fall head over heels for someone they dont know and that they know doesnt know them Get to know your crush beyond the absolute basics birthday favorite color etc and learn what really makes them tick Of course the best way to do that is to communicate with them  Find things you have in common This will give you something to talk about but it will also give you something to bond over Youll be friends before you know it and a friendship is much easier to build on You can compare interests learn their interests just by paying attention or you can explore the things they like Who knows maybe youll find that you really like their taste   The qualities of a good friend are also the qualities of a good boyfriend or girlfriend so start by being a good friend so that your crush can see what they have to look forward to They say that the person you date should be your best friend so its probably a good idea to set the bar high right   You can be supportive when theyre feeling down help them whenever you can be fun and help them relax make them laugh especially when theyre having a bad day and generally be a good friend   There needs to be trust in order for real romantic feelings to develop and stick around Never reveal a secret they tell you dont generally go around telling people their business and be someone that they can come to with their problems without having to worry about being laughed at or judged   Give them the space to go out and do the things that they want to do One fear that a lot of people have about dating is that the demand on their time and affection will mean that they wont be able to hang out with their friends or on their own as much and that they wont get the time to do the things that they want to do Give your crush some space and alone time and theyll see that you value their happiness above your own   Well they need to know that you like them dont they Flirt with them and show them that you are definitely interested This will tell them that they can return your feelings without having to worry as much about rejection But dont flirt too much Maybe tell them to give them a reason to think about you but not to early or they will just back away   If things dont work out dont get discouraged This doesnt mean you cant be friends Later on that person may feel they too like you and finally hit things off Now if things are going downhill once your relationship starts talk to your crush about it If you think you need a break tell them If they find out that you are being a little shaky but you arent being honest about it the relationship will come to a stop Breakups are the worst so dont let that happen to you
If your too shy to talk to him at first make or develop a friendship with someone close to him and hang around with them this is also a great opportunity to make new friends You can start by laughing at his jokes then answering questions he asked to the group and so on and so forth until you are ready to speak to himWhen you are feeling that you two are getting close tell him that you like a boy but you dont know how to tell him and when he asks who is it dont tell him and see what he does or says after that  MSN is good too You could share more things and become closer to them without having to talk TOO much in person But remember you do need to talk to them Dont talk to him every night though then he will think you are desperate   Flirt a little Laugh at his jokes but not too much just giggles act happy to see him and twirl you hair Try to play sports guys love girls who like sports And try to find out his interests and try them but dont change yourself too much   You could use this as a guideline for how long you wait before you tell him Wait until something similar to that subject happens   If he asks who you like just say no one dont make anyone up If he says no one too its a good sign If he likes another girl use it to your advantage What is it about her he likes Is she well liked If she is why Is she funny Sweet If its because shes pretty think about why shes pretty Is it her long hair Big eyes Dont copy her completely but try to accentuate whatever you have in common Try out some of her interests but if you try all of them he might notice and think you are weird   Theres a little something called selffulfilling prophecy which means that if you think its going to go terribly it will lead to subconscious mannerisms that will make it go terribly Believe it will go well and it most likely will   Ask him who he likes again or say Do you still like her They might say Why or YeahNo because  What about you Then is the time to laugh or type Id rather do it through cyber Ha then saytypetext Im kind of starting to like you But only if it seems like he is ready

past makes it near impossible to forget a loved one   Try and remember that you cannot undo the past The only thing you have the power to change is the present moment Go forward with the intent of making today the best day possible Some people find using a conscious cue helps For example when you find yourself lingering on the past stop and say That was then this is now I want to focus on my own happinessMeditation yoga and exercise are all great means to keep your mind focused on the present Try signing up for a local gym or enrolling in a yoga or meditation class Hobbies can be a great way to distract yourself and focus on moving forward with your life Try a new video game take up knitting join a local sports league or start doing crossword puzzles Anything you can do to help you

Perhaps this is the biggest secret but really its the clincher The best way to impress a girl is to not set out to impress her Now you might be wondering how this really works The issue at heart is that when most guys try to impress girls they tend to become less authentic and when this happens they can try to show off with almost anything and everything Girls are not impressed by such tactics and tend to end up putting you in the show off category unimpressed by the antics and bravado The best way to impress a girl is to be yourself let things happen automatically and keep the show pony antics for your mates  If you thought that girls are impressed by money and material things all the time then you are mistaken The best way to impress a girl and retain your status is by the way of natural talents which involve the way you talk and present yourself You need girls to respect you for who you are   If the girl is impressed by your money then she is probably looking for money and not you so thats a good telltale sign to back off   Dont talk to her with the quest to impress rather try to do what you normally do One of the best aspects which almost every girl demands and gets impressed by is intellectuality Try to develop your intellectual skills This can be done by the way to reading books quality online articles and being uptodate with the latest happenings Remember that being a good talker is the foundation of impressing almost any girl   Have something which is different from the rest Girls normally get hit on by several men every day and almost all those men try to impress them with all theyâve got If you are doing and following the same tactics as all those men then you wont succeed in your quest to impress girls   Avoid being erotic or crass that just scares girls off Make it clear that you like her   If she is insecure anything you do to to get her attention must be positive and slow When you take your time it shows her that you care enough to take it slowly         The way to melt a girls heart is to show kindness and to be considerate of her needs Notice the person she really is and compliment that not her looks clothes or hotness Actually show that you care about her by noticing her personality intelligence style and creativity  Tell her she is pretty with no makeup and sweats with her hair in a messy bun or ponytail Compliment her on the care she has taken to present herself she will feel appreciated when its noticed       Buy her a gift like chocolate it doesnt have to be special or expensive its the obviousness that you were thinking about her in your free time that makes her blush If she is cold or just for fun give her your sweatshirt or coatââit has your smell and she will like to wear it   Theres nothing a girl likes more than being talked to by guys even if there is an age difference   Hold actual conversations with the girl and talk about the things that matter to both of you but let her do more of the talking to begin with to allow you to learn about her Dont tell tall stories to try to impress her Shell see through it and youll come across looking daft   Girls really want someone who will not let them down and who is a promisekeeper If you cant do something you said youd do tell her the truth dont make up stories   Girls love a guy who cares about her and who wont make fun of her if shes in a bad situation         Be playful in a fun and kind way Also be wary of the following   Dont make her feel awkward when she is with you       Dont be a jerk Girls hate it when you try to get their attention by putting other people off or making a bad comment about what someone looks like Dont be a horndog and make comments about doin it with her thats an immediate turnoff Dont pressure her to do anything she doesnt dont want to do with you Dont brag about what youve done in intimacy with her to your mates Thats a code breaker and potentially a relationship breaker too   Call or contact her at least once a day when you see her and twice when you dont It helps her to feel special
Girls are often very insecure and dont want to embarrass both themselves and you by coming on too strong so you should make the first move One thing that may be going through a girls mind is What if he doesnt like me back If he likes me he can get off his shy butt and come over here and tell me  If you ask a girl for her number and she rejects you move on as shes obviously not interested   If however she does give you her number try to only use it to arrange dates It is all too easy to give a girl the wrong impression about how you feel For example constantly texting her will probably give her the idea that you are in love with her and set very high expectations for your relationship   Dont lead a girl on if you are going to change your mind Of course you should not go out with her after the first date if there is no connection If you feel there is no connection say so early on and dont leave her hanging this will result in resentment from her   Let her know you are interested but dont be too eager See how she reacts when you start the conversation and go from there   Girls are much more likely to fall for you if you be yourself rather than falling for the person youre pretending to be   Dont behave strangely towards her around your friends Many boys think that their friends will tease them if they are all loved up with their girlfriend To make it easier see your friends separately from your girlfriend If you are together though be yourself with your friends but make sure you dont leave your girlfriend out   To get a girl to kiss you you should be sure first that she likes you back Then hint touch her arm and look into her eyes or look at her lips then at her It is a good idea to make some contact before the kiss so holding her hand or tucking her hair behind her ear is a good start Lean in  but slowly so that if she doesnt look up for it you can just touch her arm and say something instead If she leans toward you as well then good Move your head slightly to one side first and she will follow If she pulls away before you expected dont be awkward just act like you wanted it to end then as well Dont pressure her into anything   If a girl is hitting on you and you arent interested make it clear Sure she might get upset but that is better than going along with it and breaking up with her later
Your crush may be the prettiest person in the woodwind section but if you donât know anything about her how can you know if sheâs someone youâd want to date Try to notice the important things about her if she treats her friends well if sheâs nice to little kids and less popular people if sheâs passionate about something cool Make sure you like both her personality and her face before trying to date her   If shes funny notice what kind of jokes she makes A nice person doesnt hurt other peoples feelings to get laughsIf shes smart see if she helps others too If she walks the person sitting next to her through a math problem its a sign that shes kind too  If you go to school together or have friends in common figure out a way to talk to your crush a bit in a lowpressure situation For example you and your lab partner could collaborate with her and her lab partner or a project If you want to see her outside of school maybe she and her friends can come out with you and your friendsSay Ellen and Tyree and I are going bowling after schoolwant to come with us You can bring other people too   If you donât have any friends in common start by simply talking to her Donât use a pickup line or anything like that Just smile greet her by name and ask about something you both have in common Say something like Hi Bethany Have you gotten the hang of the new choir piece yet Group hangs are fun but they arenât the same as dates Remember that you arenât on a date unless both people know itâs a dateThis means itâs no fair to act like youâre inviting a ton of friends to the movies when youâre only inviting her   Girls arenât a different species and they donât need to be decoded You wonât be able to know if she likes you just because she plays with her hair or touches your shoulder a certain amount of times What you can tell is if she enjoys spending time with you If her face lights up when she sees you or if you have a great time swapping jokes whenever you hang out youâre probably on the right track   If a girl touches your arm or shoulder a lot itâs a sign that she feels comfortable around you which is a good signIf she initiates plans with you for instance by signaling that she wants to be conversation partners in Spanish class that means she enjoys your companyIf conversation flows naturally when youâre together you probably have both mutual interests and compatible communication styles Thatâs also good news   Once youâre friendly and if youâre still interested in your crush take the next step and get her phone number If you both hang out and talk already this wonât be a outrageous request so stay calm   When you ask say something simple and matter of fact like âCan we trade numbers I want to be the first to hear your opinions on the new Marvel movieâIf youâre working on a project together thisâll be even more natural Say âWell probably need to meet over the weekend to lay out the newspaper together Can I text youâ You can also make this part of planning a group hang Say âIâm stoked for the concert with you Brian and Jessica Can I have your number so we can make sure we meet in the same placeâ   When youâve started texting your crush itâs best to begin in a friendly openended way A salutation and question initiates conversation and allows you to gauge whether sheâs busy or preoccupied For example send a text that says âHi what are you up toâ or âHello how are you todayâ   Donât just say âhiâ or âheyâ It sounds lazy and she might not know what to say in responseUse followup questions too All girlsall peoplelike to feel that theyâre interesting Ask her to tell you more about her quirky dance teacher her semifinal softball game or what itâs like to babysit her little brother Texting etiquette is complicated For instance everyone knows that ending every text with a period makes you sound angry You donât need to write an English paper but do your best to check your spelling and not put commas where they donât belong This will show her that you like her enough to put thought into your writingHi whats up Is the math homework destroying you as badly as its destroying me looks a lot better than hi whats  is the math hmwrk killing u 2   Most people are more relaxed in the evening following a busy day at school or work Youâll have more time to respond to each otherâs thoughts this way Plus communicating with her at night can feel more romantic than telling her you like her in broad daylightMake sure not to text after bedtime which can feel invasive Wind down the texts after 10 PM or so You want to be able to give your full attention to the conversation and you want her to be able to give you attention too This means that its best not to text her when shes told you about other plans If sheâs told you that sheâs going out with friends for instance give her a little space You can always text her tomorrow and ask how her girlsnightout wentIt works the other way toodonât text her right before a movie if you know youâll be distracted   The more upbeat and positive the conversation the more receptive a girl will be when you tell her you like her Try to stay away from negative topics that can ruin the mood such as problems at school or work or controversial subjects that can upset her and turn conversation sour   Talk about pop culture you have in common If youâre both giant Potterheads ask how she feels about the new movie trailer Joke about something in your daily life you both share If the school lunch was an inedible casserole ask if sheâs having nightmares about it too This shows youâre a good listener and that you care and that you pay attention to everything she shares with you For example if she once mentioned that she likes bowling ask about her highest score or favorite alley This is often more effective than telling a girl you like her because it shows you understand her and recognize her best qualities For example if you like her knowledge of comics tell her that you learn something new about the XMen every time you talk to herAvoid complimenting your crushâs physical characteristics like her body or eyes at this stage It can come off as creepyIf your crush has recently rocked a performance or other big event congratulate her on her skills   Texting is fun but too much of it can become really intense If youâre texting your crush for several hours a day it might be time to dial it back a bit This is especially true if you seem to be putting more effort into your texts than she isIf you text your crush twice and she doesnât respond back off for a whileIf sheâs into you sheâll text you again when sheâs ready Donât go too far in the other direction and never text her back You may be trying to play it cool but if she feels ignored sheâll feel bad   You donât need to write yourself a perfect script but take a little time and figure out when and how to tell your crush that youâre into her If you think ahead a little bit youâre less likely to fumble and forget yourself or blurt out something too intense âIâve had a crush on you for seven yearsâ   Consider that itâs often better to ask someone on a clearlydefined date This way youâre telling her that you like her and giving her an opportunity for an action planKnow how youâll deal if youâre rejected Rejection happens to everyone and itâs not the end of the world Itâs easiest to say something like âThank you for telling me I enjoy hanging out with you as friends so no worriesâ take a bit of space then return to the friendship after a couple weeks This is a confident indirect way to tell a girl you like her without actually saying you like her Send this text after hanging out together or even after an official date Say something like âI had fun with you tonight and enjoyed your company Canât wait to do it againâ   Be simple and direct This shows that youâre confident and feel strongly enough about your feelings that youâre willing to admit it word for word Make your statement more personal by sharing what you like most about her For example say âIâm into you because youre so passionate about social justiceâ or âI like you because youre sunny enough to brighten anyones dayâJust like when youâre complimenting a girl mention something specific about her personality that you like Tell her that she cracks you up whenever you hang out or that her commitment to saving the environment is powerful and cool   Now that youâve laid your feelings bare you probably want to take your relationship a step further by dating The only way to date a girl is of course to go on a date with her After youâve told her you like her invite her on an outing for just the two of you Make it clear that itâs not a âgroup hangâ or a casual thingitâs a real date   When youâre asking someone out always suggest a specific date and time Say something like Want to get deepdish and see the school play Friday night This way if she likes you but canât make it sheâll reschedule If sheâs not interested itâll be a lot easier on your feelings to hear âIâm sorry I canât make itâ then âI donât feel that way about youâPlan the date around things you both like If youâre both into minigolf and milkshakes ask Want to go to my favorite range on Thursday after school We can stop by the diner for milkshakes after
There is a tendency for younger people in elementary school to socialize with people they donât like romantically Kissing may not be for everyone so itâs important that you understand the person you want to kiss and how they feel about kissingAsk them about kissing If they seem grossed out or embarrassed they may not be ready for a kiss You donât have to give away your intentions to kiss them Say something like âMy older brother kissed his girlfriend in front of me What do you think about kissingâ You can ask their friends how they feel about kissing   If someone does not like you they probably wonât want to kiss you Think about how you talk and treat each other If they are constantly telling you to go away that youâre annoying or that they donât want to be around you itâs a good sign they donât like you   If they always go out of their way to help you and always wants to talk to you they may like you If they tease you donât lose hope Some kids in elementary school tease other kids because they like themIf they go out of their way to talk to you and be around you it might be a sign that they actually like you even if teasing is involved   You canât force or trick anyone to like you If you feel like your crush doesnât like you try to find someone else It might be hard and it may make you very sad but you shouldnât be ashamed There are plenty of people that will enjoy your company   Try to make friends with other kids in school to take your mind off the person you want to kiss Donât give up immediately Donât assume they donât like you without trying to talk to them   If you want to kiss a boy there are common signs that point to if he likes your or not If he fiddles with his shirt or socks leans or stands with a wide stance talks with his hands or seems nervous thereâs a good chance he likes youIf youâre curious if a girl likes you she will usually tilt her head towards you point her feet in your direction play with her hair or will blush when sheâs around youDonât take every action as a sign of something Only consider this advice if this is how they always act around you   Even if youâre scared or self conscious act like you are confident If you smile stand up straight and talk clearly it will appear like youre confident even if youâre notTry practicing when youâre in other situations so you can do it naturally when youâre around your crush
Donât worry about organization Just open your heart and let it spill Even if it sounds weird on paper you can always change it later  Just like in English class writing a great letter that will make her smile requires a process   Let her know that you find her special and that you would like a chance to get to know her better   Similes such as âYour eyes are like a deep blue oceanâ or âYour smile is like a sunrise that welcomes a wonderful dayâ are ideas of how to make your letter stand out Donât overdo it but a little spice in the soup will get her attention   If sheâs interested this will get her excited   You just want to let her know how you feel
Think about what you should say to your crush before you get them talking Have a certain topic in mind that youâd like to discuss and be prepared to answer any question he or she might ask about you That way youâll be primed and ready to make a good impression during your first interaction and youâll have less chance of being caught off guardBe ready for whatever turns your first meeting may take Your crush might be tired busy distracted or nervous and these moods can affect the way he or she comes off   One surefire tactic for keeping someone that youâre talking to for the first time interested is focusing the conversation on them Typically itâs easier for people to talk about themselves because they already know what to say Show an interest in your crush and let them talk about themselves relating to them when you can This will also give you a chance to get to know a little more about themAsk questions Itâll make your crush feel like you have a genuine interest in them and it can also take some of the pressure of thinking of things to say about yourselfYou should talk about yourself of course but dont steal the floor entirely Try to keep things even or let him or her take over and guide the conversation   Listen when your crush talks about his or her hobbies interests and preferences and see where they overlap with your own The more things you discover you have in common the more the two of you will have to talk about Finding common ground could even help create an opportunity for a date or more casual hangout later onSome good topics for finding out what you have in common are what classes youâre taking movies music sports family and your plans for the weekend   Keep track of how long youâve been talking to your crush to make sure youâre not holding them up and pay attention to when they seem to be losing interest Unless you really hit it off your first couple of interactions might not last too long and itâs better if you can lend yourself a sense of mystique and leave them wanting more Excuse yourself with a phrase like âtalk to you laterâ or âtext me sometimeâ youll want to make sure they have your number first to let your crush know that you want to talk to them againGet a feel for natural lulls in the dialogue and look for an opportunity to make a smooth exit when things start to slow down just as you made a smooth entranceDonât ramble on and on The last thing you want to do is bore your love interest
Some people like to start their song by writing the lyrics but if youâre not an experienced songwriter it can be tricky to find a melody or track to fit those lyrics Look for a beat that you like then write the rest of the song to fit that beat You should also consider using a slower beat if you are planning to write a love song that is sensual and sexy for your crush Pay close attention to the melody and rhythm of the track and try to fit your lyrics into whatâs already there If your crush likes a certain genre of music like pop or hip hop you can also look for a backing track that falls within that genre  If you play an instrument or are musically inclined you may be able to write the melody for the song yourself Start by picking a simple chord progression then build the melody for the song on top of thatTry strumming or playing the chord progression while vocally improvising a melody Record your improvisation and listen to it back to see if thereâs anything you want to keep Start with a basic chord progression like DEA or AmFCG Sometimes a melody will pop into your head fully formed but sometimes you have to work a little harder Practice singing the melody of a hit song then fooling around with the melody to make it your ownChange the pitches of the ghost melody to be higher or lower Where the song usually rises have the melody fall instead Try syncopating the beat or adding pauses where thereâs usually music   The hook is the chorus of your song Some beginning songwriters find it easier to write the hook first then compose the rest of the lyrics Familiarize yourself with the beat and melody of the song then try to write the chorus to fit that beat and melodyThink of the hook as the thesis to your love song and try to sum up how you feel about your crush in a single statement Brainstorm some ideas then try to write the chorus based off those You may write down a few keywords that come to mind when you think about your crush such as âsmartâ âstrongâ âhotâ âbraveâ or âsensualâ The lyrics for the chorus can be very simple like âHit me baby one more timeâ or âCome on ride the train Ride itâ You may combine a few keywords to create the chorus âSheâs smart strong and hotâ or âHeâs brave sensual and strongâ Typically the title of the song should also appear in the chorusFor example if you use the chorus âSheâs smart strong and hotâ the song may be called âSmart Strong and Hotâ   Part of what makes a good chorus is setting up and paying off a rhyme There are many ways to set up the rhyming structure of your chorus and thereâs no right or wrong way to go about doing it Your options for the rhyming structure areRepeat the same line at least three times If you choose to do this make sure the line is fun to say or sing For example you may repeat the line âI think youâre greatâ three times When writing a four line chorus rhyme the first line to the third line and the second line to the fourth line For example you may have the lines âI think youâre greatWe would be so good togetherYouâre the perfect mateI think we could be foreverâ Make the first and third lines the same and make the second and fourth lines the same For example you may have the lines âI think youâre greatWe would be so good togetherYouâre the perfect mateI think we could be something specialâ Make the first three lines the same then diverge from the pattern for the fourth line For example you may have the lines âI think youâre greatThe perfect mateI canât waitFor us to be togetherâ Make all four lines completely different For example you may have the lines âI think youâre greatWe would be so good togetherYouâre my idealI want to date youâ   There are many different places a chorus can go within the confines of a song Most people choose to alternate verses and choruses but there is no hard and fast rule on thisSome songs repeat the chorus of the song over and over to help signify that the song is ending If you choose to add a bridge youâll want to position an additional chorus after the bridge   Your chorus will continue to reappear throughout the course of the song so itâs important that the chorus be catchy enough that your crush will want to listen to it over and over againInfuse the chorus with emotion to help show your crush how you really feel You may talk about your feelings and emotions as well as the qualities that you appreciate in your crush Another option is to write a chorus that sounds completely different from the rest of the verses Try mixing up the rhythm or chord projections changing keys or applying shifts in volume If you know how you can also add harmonies or instruments to enhance the chorus   The verses will make up the majority of your song so you want to use them to show your crush how you really feel about them Brainstorm ideas by writing down your feelings memories or any moments youâve spent with your crush that have made you happyRead the writing out loud and look for keywords that stand out Make a list of these words and use them as the foundation for your verse lyrics   If youâve ever written anything about your crush you can use your previous writing in your song lyrics Look back at old diary entries texts tweets or poems youâve written to or about your crushTry taking an individual line from something youâve already written and building this into the verses of your song You can also look at things your crush has written to or about you and mine those for inspiration   Verses like choruses donât always rhyme If you want your verses to rhyme check out a rhyming dictionary and look for places where you can change words to fit your rhyming patternYour words donât always have to rhyme perfectly Try using slant rhymes like rhyming kiss and abyss Itâs better to have a song that doesnât rhyme then to pick words that rhyme but donât make sense in your song   You are writing a love song for your crush only You should try to make the lyrics specific to your crush as this will make the song seem more genuine and heartfelt Use personal experiences and details about your crush in the song   You may include inside jokes that you both share such as a funny moment at work or at school You may mention the inside joke in your lyrics to add a nice personal touch to the song You may also mention specific details or traits that you admire or like about your crush Try mentioning a specific moment when you noticed this trait or detail such as the time your crush helped you solve a problem on the computer showing you that they are sexy and computer savvy Or the time your crush helped you move into your new apartment a moment where you realized your crush was strong and supportive   Love songs can become familiar and generic very fast as there are too many cliches out there about love A cliche is a phrase that has become so familiar it loses its meaning You should avoid cliches in your love song so it feels specific to your crush and makes the emotional impact you are hoping for   For example avoid familiar descriptions of love like âmy love is deepâ or âmy love is everlastingâ You should also avoid describing your feelings for your crush with cliche details like âmy heart cries for youâ or âI want you so badâ Instead go for descriptions and details that feel unique and unfamiliar Try describing your feelings for your crush in a funny and creative way like âI like you more than cheese pizza and upside down cakeâ or âI think youâre cooler than anyone I knowâ Make the lyrics fun and interesting so your crush gets drawn into your love song   A bridge is used to break up a song â itâs a departure from the verses and chorus and can infuse a totally different feeling into a piece of music Write lyrics for the bridge that are emotionally based and that heighten the feeling of love in your songIf you spend the entire song talking about how much you love your crush use the bridge to describe the feeling you get when theyâre not around Build the energy throughout the bridge to help make your final chorus that much more powerful   Since the bridge is meant to be a change from the rest of the song you want to use the bridgeâs melody to reflect that Experiment with writing a new chord progression for the bridgeIf the rest of the song is in a major key switch to minor for the bridge Borrow chord progressions from different keys for the bridge Since the bridge is a heightening of the song play around with setting the bridge in a higher key End the bridge with an open chord or nontonic chord   Most songs are laid out like this verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus Your song does not have to follow this format but you can definitely use it as a template as you construct the order of your songSome songs include third verses If you have a third verse position the third verse after the bridge but before the last chorus If you only have two verses repeat the chorus twice after the bridge to capitalize on the energy built in the bridge section
You absolutely have the right to say no if you arent interested That said you dont need to be cruel in order to decline a date Try to empathize with the person Be kind and straightforwardSay I know how it feels and I feel bad to let you down like this Say I hope we can still be friends Im not interested in you romantically but I do truly value you as a human beingThink of a time when you felt rejected Consider what you can do to make the rejection less harsh   The more of a connection you make with a person the harder it can be to brush off hisher offer of a date Keep your conversation light Focus on broad and basic topics That said you may need to get serious if you are asked out by a friend or someone that you already know well   If it feels right mention someone you know that you think would adore the person that you declined Offer to introduce this person to someone that you think heshe would like Be aware that this is only appropriate in situations where a person is asking you out casually   If a friend or acquaintance is absolutely in love with you and asks you out then it may not be kind to immediately suggest an alternative Be compassionate and respectful If a stranger strikes up a conversation in the supermarket and asks you on a date then this might be the perfect opportunity to set himher up with a friend of yours Make sure that youre suggesting a match that might actually work â not just making an excuse to escape
In a healthy relationship couples make time for one another in their busy schedules If you wish to passively hint that this person is no longer worth your time limit your interactions with them Instead of hanging out with your partner or the person crushing on you pick up a hobby play video games hang out with other people or become highly focused on your career Eventually they may decide you arenât worth their time either   When you do spend time together act distracted or leave early Couples loyally support each other through the highs and the lows of life If you wish to give this person a reason to stop loving you revoke your support Do not attend their sporting events or concerts Do not ask them about their test or pitch When they come to you for help or advice minimize their problems or support the other party Your inability to provide moral support may make them search for someone more loyal Partners rely on words and actions to communicate their feelings with each other By withholding your ability to be vulnerable you will successfully create an emotional void in your relationship Refuse to share your feelingsâwhen you are hurt refuse to talk about it Avoid all forms of physical contact Overtime they may deem you emotionally unavailable and an undesirous partner
If you see a natural opportunity to walk past him take it If you notice that he walks down a certain hallway every day at a certain time position yourself there Do this sparingly otherwise you may come off as desperate   Make sure when you are walking past him that you are doing so for a purpose Get a drink from a water fountain heâs standing near or go into the library if heâs standing out front chatting with his friends When you do walk past him makes sure to stand up straight hold your head up high walk with confidence and have a smile on your face This doesnât mean sit right NEXT to him â that would be too obvious But sitting near him in his line of vision if possible can definitely get you noticed and create a scenario in which heâll approach you to talk If you share a class with him sit nearby At lunch sit with your friends one table over   Try walking past him with an armload of heavy books or try to enter a door heâs standing near with your hands full Perhaps even walk by him looking confused or lost as though you are trying to find a classroom or a person and having no luck   While the âdamsel in distressâ act shouldnât be employed too often it can definitely be effective in getting a conversation started or at the very least provide an opportunity to lock eyes with him and smile If you know heâs interested in something in particular give it a try yourself For instance if you know he enjoys watching basketball games at school go to one yourself every now and then If he loves music occasionally drop by your local record shop Bump into him at the gym If you see one another while in the midst of a common interest heâs almost certain to come over and chat with you about it   Donât go to extremes to make this happen You donât need to force yourself to enjoy anything that you donât like Keep it natural Plan carefully and donât try to pop up at every single event or hobby heâs interested in Doing this will likely make you seem creepy and the stalker vibe is not one you want to give off   If you are already friendly with some of his close friends and it feels natural to do so get closer to those people It will provide him with plenty of opportunities to approach you Not only that but his friends will have nothing but nice things to say about you in front of him which is never a bad thing
Talk to her like you would to anyone else If you ignore her shell think that you are angry with her That is not a good place to start a relationship  Explain it to her that you are sorry for any upset you have caused her girls love to know that a guy truly cares Straighten out any rumors that are flying around Make sure that in doing this youre not pressuring her   Itll help her feel more relaxed and show that you take time for her   Compliment her but not too much or youll sound obsessive Make sure you only compliment her if what you are saying is sincere   Talk to her but act like she doesnt know you fancy her Do not pretend not to like her because its not polite or nice to her and then you will never have a chance with her   Just because you like her does not mean you withhold any helpful views from her If you feel that she must know something say it frankly but gently She will appreciate you   If she is mature enough she may also consider you to be a gentleman   The message is to be nonchalant Liking someone puts ones dignity under risk as most feel vulnerable and curb the desire to hurt the girl One way you could maintain a stand or save face is by being relaxed and minding your own business For that you must have some business Engage into productive and positive activities and see yourself appear brighter before her and the rest of the crowd Being busy will also guard you against being overtly exposed to any shock or disappointment if any
If you like a girl but havenât had the chance to actually meet her start with a simple introduction Be relaxed and start with a simple greetingYou could say âHi Itâs so great to finally meet you My name is Johnâ You might say âHello My name is Susan So lovely to finally meet youâ  Although breaking the ice can be intimidating try to find a way to keep the conversation going beyond an initial greeting You might try an indirect approach such as asking for a favor making a statement and expressing curiosityIf you are at the cafeteria you could say âDo you mind passing the saltâ If you are at a coffee shop you could say âWow the dark roast is excellentâ   Although it may sound simple girls love it when you say their name in a conversation When you address them in a conversation remember to include their first nameFor instance you should use their name when you ask them for a favor You could say âSusan could you pass the ketchupâ You should also use their name when you ask them a question For instance you might say âSusan I was wondering what inspired you to get into competitive swimmingâ   If you go to school or work together you could ask her what she enjoys doing in her own time By showing an interest in her life youâll be subtly hinting that you like her If she shares something about her life listen and learn Laughing is one of the best ways to drop a hint that you like a girl especially if she has a sense of humor If she cracks a joke donât be the person who ignores it or fails to get her way of seeing the world Show your appreciation for her sense of humorIf you have an inside joke bring it up often Crack a joke Even if its lame shell laugh at the attempt and may even find it cute   Since she makes you happy express yourself with a nice grin Be genuine and use body language such as touching your face or hair while you smile Sheâll appreciate how friendly and genuine you are with her and she may very well smile back You can develop a friendship with her by finding a common interest such as a band or an artist you both like Once you find a common interest nurture the friendship by taking time to learn about your common interest together For instance if the band you like comes to town you could see if she wants to go see them with youOnce you find a band you both like you could ask her which album she likes best If you are both really into the same band you could ask her on a concert date You could say âI have an extra ticket to the Drake concert in July Do you want to goâ   Instead of pretending to be someone you think she will like youâre better off simply being yourself Share your true interests beliefs values and opinions By giving an honest picture of yourself youâll be showing how much you like and respect her
This is the most important step to moving on from a breakup There are times when you wonder âWas it meâ âWas it my exâ âCan we work on our problems and get back togetherâ or âWill I connect with anyone as much as I did with my exâ  These questions were all meant to be thought up and answered before the breakup If the relationship has ended continue to follow through If your ex broke up with you the chance for you to be informed as to why has come and gone Crying due to being hurt by the unexpected surprise is never an excuse especially since all mourning of a discontinued relationship should be done in solitude    Relationship memorabilia is everything that reminds you of being in a relationship with your former lover These things include your ex loverâs clothes gifts you were given gifts that were given to you as a couple pictures texts between you and your ex and the connection between you and your former lover on any and every social network  This may seem a tad extreme but it helps you from undergoing a mental breakdown or unwanted yearning for a particular mismatch of a counterpart later on Burning a jacket that the notsosignificantother left behind at your apartment may be just as healthy Then again so would returning said jacket to its owner Totally your call     Everyone in your life who knew about your relationship is going to want to know what the cause of the breakup was The storytelling unfortunately leads to the constant reliving of the event and the reopening of emotional wounds and tension Whether you have a good poker face or not your character may be negatively perceived by others since sharing a stressful moment or discussing someone you dislike typically leads to the use of venomous speech and causes you to be as worked up as you were while actually experiencing the incident Just stick to the basics The two of you are no longer together you are much happier now and you will never continue the former partnership     Never force friends to pick between you and your ex Instead after the news of the breakup has been shared allow your true friends to make the loyal â yet mature â moves that they should in order to remain prominent in your life Those whom you have met through the relationship should not be expected to only keep up with simply you mutual friends will feel the need to spend equal time with both you and your former lover Friends that have been a part of your life before you met your ex will not hesitate to cut your former âbetter halfâ out of their daily lives â same should be expected of your exâs associates and confidantes A thorough weeding of the friends list of your social networks is definitely in order as well     The coincidental runin with a potential current or former lover is never unintentional One of the factors in deciding whether or not you should go to the biannual school fair or college night at the local bar is whether or not you will run into a specific someone or someones If there is ever the slightest chance of you running into your ex at a public event or venue do NOT pass âGoâ Altering your plans and regular hangouts should never be the case however Just be aware that if your ex knows of your usual hot spots for a night on the town he or she will not give up a chance to make at least one night an awkward time for you Nothing good will ever come from a reunion Never     Whether you randomly remember a good experience or a very tragic occurrence if the event has anything to do with your insignificant other move the account to the back of your mind and never utter the name of âthouwhomustnotbenamedâ ever again Memories are precious things which you are able to carry with you even when times you spend with others â or those you have spent lifealtering moments with â have come and gone  Memorable times with your ex could be mistakenly excused as being cautionary tales or moments to look forward to with your next and hopefully final love of your life but these should never be the case Constantly thinking of your ex will cause you to constantly crave to spend time with him or her or wonder what he or she is up to Mentioning your ex means that you are thinking of your ex â which should never be the case becauseâyour ex should always remain your ex     The relationship is over and if you have accepted the breakup and decided that you would like to move on with your life interactions with your former lover are over as well Keeping in contact with an ex creates that illusion that the two of you can remain friends the emotional relationship which was forsaken once you became lovers  Never wish the ex a happy birthday Refrain from sending a holiday greeting Delete that urge to ask âHow are youâ This may seem like a step to becoming a bitter ex but it is in fact part of becoming a smart emotionally stable individual You must accept the fact that you cannot change every situation in your life that has gone astray and you are most certainly also unable to stay in the good graces of everyone you meet All you can do is let go of the past and stay open to positive future experiences
Since he may be honest and unabashed in his pursuit of you it may be tempting to put off rejecting him to avoid breaking his heart This can hurt him by allowing him to be led on and look like a fool Its best to rip off the bandaid and tell him right away   Since mixed signals can confuse autistic people directly explain that youre flattered but uninterested While hell feel a little sad part of him will feel grateful that you were clear with him so he could stop wasting his time wooing someone who didnt want to be wooed   Speak as clearly and compassionately as you can Then tell him if you want to be friends or if you think its better that you go your separate ways Dont offer to be his friend out of pity You wont be doing him or yourself a favor Only offer to be his friend if you truly like being with him   He will probably be okay with going back to being friends   Seeing you might be painful to him for a while and he may be too polite to say it If you notice that he seems a little sadder or more distant than usual it might be time to back off for a little while   For example if he likes to spend hours chatting in the evenings its okay to say Hey I really cant talk with you after 7 pm Ive got plans tonight You dont have to mention that the plans involve movies and fuzzy pajamas   Explain that a specific action makes you uncomfortable or is socially inappropriate Give reasons if you can Most likely he will be apologetic and respectful of your feelings   For example It startles me and makes me feel uncomfortable when you hug me from behind Please stop doing that If you want a hug you can approach me from the front or hug somebody else It may feel blunt but clarity is the best way to get through to him That way he wont keep doing something you dont like and then feel embarrassed or guilty about not noticing the signals later   Remember that autistic people while sometimes socially clueless are good at heart Raising your voice or making accusations will hurt him and you may feel like a bully afterwards
If you have some close friends who are always hanging around you two then you may be able to ask them if they think he really likes you You may be too blinded by Cupidâs arrow to be able to see the situation clearly but one of your friends may have more insight   Ask a friend you trust who already knows the situation well If sheâs seen you hang out a bunch of times she should have an opinion Ask a friend to study the two of you next time youâre together and to report back Just make sure the friend isnât being too obvious Pick a friend whose opinion and judgment you value Pick someone with good social sense to get the best answer Tell your friends to be honest If they really donât think he likes you or even know that he likes someone else then you should benefit from the truth   This is a very dangerous step There are few boys who would break âbro codeâ and not run and report your question back to your crush But if you donât know who else to ask or if you really trust one of his friends then casually ask how he feels about you   Though this is a riskier step his friends will have a better answer than your friends since they have firsthand information from your guy Ask his friend if he likes you could also just be a sneaky way to let him know how you feel If youâre too scared to tell him yourself this information will get back to him ASAP if you tell the wrong person   Once youâre feeling fairly confident that the guy likes you and are tired of waiting around and reading the signs it may be time to just tell him how you feel and ask if he feels the same way He could be really shy and may be relieved that youâre taking the initiative Hereâs how to ask him if he really likes you   Find some time to be alone with him Make sure you donât ask him when his friends are looking over your shoulder Be honest and open Just say you have a crush on him and want to know if he shares your feelings Before he responds let him know that itâs no big deal if he doesnât like you You should only do this if youâre pretty sure that he likes you If he has exhibited multiple signs of liking you then be bold and ask him If he has shown no signs of liking you then it may be time to wait to see what happens
If you are able to see your crush one last time before leaving it can be very helpful It will give you closure and a final memory If you are comfortable you can even tell them how you feel It can be a huge relief to get it off your chest Unexpressed feelings can cause stress and sadness so it might help you in the long run to tell them exactly how you feel about them  When youâre going through something hard a lot of people will tell you to âStay strongâ While their intentions are good itâs OK to express your emotions Sometimes a good cry can get out some of those awful emotions that words canâtDonât bottle up your feelings because they could come out when you least expect it   Sadness isnât pathetic or a sign of weakness Tears just mean you really cared about someone and youâre sad to say goodbye Donât be ashamed   When youâre young often times your crushes arenât taken seriously by others nor are your heartbreaks People may not understand your sadness but that doesnât mean you should sweep it under the rug Be gentle with yourself and treat yourself to the things you enjoy doing Draw up a bubble bath take a yoga class or play a third round of video games Give yourself little treats to help you in your sad time   Itâs helpful to be honest with your parents and friends about how youâre feeling so they understand what is going on   Itâs good to let your feelings out but itâs not good to throw yourself a neverending pity party Give yourself a limit of how long youâll let yourself wallowMaybe itâs a weekend maybe itâs a full week Spend that spoiling yourself or doing the clichÃ things that people do to get over a breakup Eat sweets watch movies sleep in cry listen to sad music and do anything else that you feel like doing When youâve reached the time limit you set for yourself stop Turn off the sad music tidy up call some friends and get ready to start moving on   Wallowing will never make you feel better Itâs OK to do it for a little bit and get out those awful feelings but itâs not a longterm solution   When youâre down in the dumps it can be tempting to isolate yourself and hide in your bedroom Challenge yourself to say âyesâ to every invitation that comes your way Whether itâs shooting hoops with your dad going to the movies with a friend or running errands with your mom just say yes Leaving the house and surrounding yourself with people who love you can be incredibly helpful Now is a great time to dive into that big project youâve been considering starting Rather than sitting around and thinking about your crush do something productive and fun Redecorate your room start a blog train for a race learn how to cook a new recipe whatever The more energy you channel into a fun project the less energy youâll have to be upset over your crush You may feel lethargic and down when you know you wonât see your crush again but itâs important to keep doing the things that bring you joy Donât skip your extracurriculars or cancel plans that you typically love just because youâre sad You may dread going somewhere or following through on your plans but end up having a fantastic time Give yourself the chance to forget about your crush and remember the hobbies you love doing If you are never going to see your crush again itâs important to close that chapter to move onto the next You will probably not be able to move on if you sleep with his picture next to your bed or stalk his Facebook every single dayYou donât need to burn his photograph or unfriend him but you should tuck the photo away somewhere and try not to look at their page The less youâre bombarded with memories of him the sooner you can heal and move on   Instagram Snapchat Twitter and other social media platforms can be great ways to stay in contact with your crush if they live far away However these can also extend the amount of time that youre upset and stuck on them Try to minimize your interactions through social media For example reduce your daily Snapchat messages from ten to five and then to none It might seem unnecessary or even harsh but its much easier to get over someone and close the chapter if you arent communicating with them 247   Your crush was probably awesome but hes not the only awesome person youâll ever meet It can be hard to know that youâll never see him again but you will definitely have new crushes You may let them pass by if youâre too busy mourning your last crush Get excited about your future because there will be plenty of amazing people coming in and out of your life Once youâve successfully coped with saying a permanent goodbye to a crush youâre a stronger and wiser person Youâve learned how to make it through a really tough situation and youâll be able to handle hard things in the future Painful experiences are never pointlessâ youâre officially a tougher and smarter person after it all
Jealousy is natural and often something that we cannot control If you choose to make your girlfriend jealous understand that you may unearth some feelings that she is not ready to deal with like insecurity or shame Jealousy stems from being selfcritical Be careful how you choose to make your girlfriend jealous because she might already have an unhealthy perception of herself Your girlfriend may have experienced damaging relationships in the past but be too ashamed to tell anyone or she might have consciously moved past it however subconsciously she still may suffer from its negative effects Shame can influence how jealous and insecure your girlfriend will become so avoid exploiting her innermost sensitivitiesDo not open old wounds If she has shared something intimate with you you will damage your relationship by using it against her   Whether youâre trying to make her jealous to reignite your relationship or as a playful prank learn what will trigger her jealousy The attention you pay her will not only allow you to learn how to make her jealous but it will also create a bond Consequently be aware that the stronger your bond the more toxic jealousy can becomeSome people are more sensitive than others so be aware of what triggers will push her too far For example some girls may find playful flirting with strangers amusing while others may find it very disrespectful and will end a relationship over it Tread lightly   Donât go too far with this charade Ask yourself what youâre hoping to achieve by making your girlfriend jealous Evaluate what your relationship means to you and proceed with caution if you think that jealousy is the best course of action   Relationships can be fragile if you introduce elements that can easily play on your girlfriendâs psyche No matter how openminded she says she is itâs easy to play up her paranoia with logic For example keeping a relationship with an ex may easily bring about jealousyIf she says that she does not want you to interact with someone do not use this against her Her paranoia is already at high alert so breaking your promise will do irreversible damage Avoid using an ex to make her jealous Knowing that you already have had a romantic relationship makes it easy to believe you can rekindle it at any moment Do not mention high profile friends Whether you have mutual friends that are on tv play professional sports or have high paying jobs their social status makes them an alluring romantic pursuit Your girlfriend may easily become jealous if you show too much favor to a high profile friend   Make plans to watch sports or hit the bar with your buddies Make your girlfriend jealous by showing her that you have a healthy social lifeDonât make her feel like a burden or that she isnât fun to be around This is just meant to show her that you are fun to be around   Like a photo or leave fun comments to friends that you know she will see Social media can be open to interpretation Your girlfriend may easily become jealous if your social media is littered with Likes towards other women It can also be filled with inside jokes or photos of experiences that she was not there for Your job can be an easy source of jealousy because you probably can spend a lot of time at work and justify it as ambition Be careful if she becomes jealous of your relationship with a coworker because her paranoia may end up costing you your job if she begins asking other coworkers about the two of you Worse yet your girlfriend may reach out to your coworkers husband or boyfriend and you could ruin your coworkers relationship unintentionally   Whether you increase your social media interactions or invite them out to activities your girlfriend may become jealous if your interest in her friends suddenly increases This is especially effective if the friend you choose is single or has complimented you in the past   Be careful if you get too close to her best friend as it may cause deep emotional damage Learn the dynamics she has with her friends so as not to open up deeper issues One of her friends may have a history of stealing men   Compliment celebrities on tv or strangers within your line of sight Your girlfriend may become jealous because she may automatically compare herself to that person Celebrities are an especially easy target as the media is obsessed with body image and managing persona While it is perfectly acceptable to interact with any gender your girlfriend may become jealous if your interactions play on her insecurities Only you will know what is appropriate and what will make her jealous Some women donât mind if playfully touching and joking with a waitress while your girlfriend may become jealous if you smile at your server the wrong way Invite a mutual female friend with you to an activity that normally only you and your girlfriend do together Be cautious not to make this an obvious wedge but rather a harmless afterthought Say something like âI invited Julia hiking tomorrow She said she hasnât been to Eagleâs Canyon so I told her weâd pick her up if she wanted to join usâ This shows that you have been paying attention to other women without being immature or obvious
A great way to get someones attention is eye contact To flirt with your crush make eye contact If youre at say a coffee shop catch your crushs gaze Hold their gaze for about four seconds and then glance away Then look back This is a flirtatious gesture that subtly invites someone to just say Hi to you This may sound odd but mirroring someones body language is read as flirtatious As you talk to your crush try to subtly mimic his mannerisms Copying someone is a way of flattering them This will give off flirty vibesWhen chatting by your locker for example mimic what hes doing If he leans onto the locker lean on to it as well If he plays with his hair play with your hair Do not be too obvious about it You do not have to copy what he does gesture for gesture However try to sit in the same position he does If he crosses his legs for example cross your legs   Smiling shows youre interested and engaged with another person While talking to him make sure to flash him a winning smile This will show him how much you enjoy being around him which can help convey that you like himSmile when you first say Hi to him When you take a seat next to him at class for example sit down and offer him a big grim Smile as he talks When he tells you about exciting portions of his day offer a smile to show you care Laugh when appropriate at well If he makes a joke about your chemistry teacher for example giggle as you smile   Once youre engaged in conversation try to introduce some small touching Brush his hand or arm Put your hand on his shoulder Tiny amounts of touch show him you want to be close to himYou can find excuses to introduce touch as well If youre waiting for the bus say youre cold and cuddle up next to him Pay close attention to how he reacts If he seems uncomfortable you should slow down with the physical contact Too much physical contact can be offputting if someone is not ready for it
If a boy has a crush on you then heâll go out of his way to try to impress you Heâll want you to think that heâs brave exciting cool or even wacky The next time youâre around the boy who might have a crush on you see if he starts trying to say or do something that is calculated to impress you If he tries to show off when heâs playing sports brags about his awesome weekend plans tries to do something crazy like jump in a pool with his clothes on or engages in other behavior that seems calculated to impress you then he may have a crush on you   Watch him closely when he does something âimpressiveâ If he keeps looking over at you to make sure youâre paying attention or to see what you think then thereâs a good chance he has a crush on you Though it can be hard to know what he does when youâre not around try to get a sense of whether he starts showing off more when youâre there For example if he starts telling a ridiculous joke or showing off his ability to juggle oranges just moments after you walk in the door this behavior may be for your benefit  This is another dead giveaway that the boy has a crush on you If heâs jealous of the guys you hang out with then it can only be for one reason because he likes you and feels threatened by them Guys have different ways of showing that theyâre jealous of other guys He may just make fun of the guys to you be rude or aggressive to the guys or just roll his eyes and turn away from the other guys in your orbit If heâs jealous of the guys youâre around itâs because he wishes he had more quality time with you instead   He wonât admit that heâs jealous of course But if you find him constantly talking about what a loser your friend Jake is or asking you why youâre even friends with a weirdo like Steve then this is his way of saying he wished you were spending time with him instead If he puts down your guy friends to their faces then heâs definitely jealous of them Though this behavior can be a problem if heâs being really rude if heâs just not being super nice for a while it may just mean that he has a crush on you   If the boy has a crush on you then heâll want to spend as much time with you as possible He may suggest that you hang out after school to study together or he may invite you to the mall to watch a movie with a big group of friends He may go to a party just because he knows youâll be there He may ask what youâre up to and may conveniently say that he was thinking of doing the same thing If it seems like heâs been around more often and that heâs been doing a lot of the same things as you then it may be because he has a crush on you   Think about it If you barely saw him a month ago and suddenly he always seems to be around then it may be because he has a crush on you He may be too shy to hang out with you by himself but if he and a pack of friends are always around it may still mean that he likes you   It may not always be easy to tell when a boy is flirting with you A lot of it depends on his age â if heâs in middle school his own way of flirting with you may even be to tease you or to poke fun at you Every age and stage of life has a slightly different definition of flirting but the main thing is if he singles you out spends more time around you than others is playful about something you say do or wear and generally singles you out even if you feel like itâs in a teasing way then it means heâs flirting with you   If heâs playful and makes fun of you for always wearing purple or keeps making jokey comments about your earrings then heâs flirting If he gently pushes you or elbows you this is his way of flirting with you and trying to get closer to you If he teases you so much that he has even come up with a special nickname for you then heâs definitely flirting   One key indicator of whether a boy has a crush on you or not is how he treats other girls If he treats other girls exactly the same way as he treats you then he may not have a crush on you But if heâs pretty flirtatious with you and ignores or doesnât care much for other girls then he may have a crush on you Another option is that heâll pay attention to other girls and will kind of ignore you â as confusing as it is this may also mean that he likes you and just feels shy toward you   The next time youâre around him and other girls notice what he does with them Does he playfully tease them ask them lots of questions or even jokingly put his arm around them If he does the same with you then he may just be a flirtatious person However if he treats them differently from you then you may be the real apple of his eye He may even be more polite and gentlemanly around you than other girls Does he hold open doors or pull out chairs for you more than he does for other girls If so then he may have a crush on you   Another sign that he has a crush on you is that the boy will find ways to do small favors for you Maybe heâll throw out your trash for you in class Maybe heâll help you carry your books Maybe heâll check what time a movie is playing for you Even the little things count Think about it Do you feel like heâs going out of his way to be helpful to you If he does this for you but not for other girls then it may mean that heâs doing favors for you because he has a crush on you   Of course he may just be a friendly guy who does favors for everyone But the chances of that are less likely than the chances of him having a crush on you The fact that he does favors for you means that heâs being thoughtful about what you need This is a sign that he has a crush on you   Nowadays one of the easiest ways to tell if a boy likes you is to see what he does when it comes to his phone He may be too shy to truly communicate with you in person and may feel more comfortable getting to know you over the phone Here are some signs that he may have a crush on you   Did he ask for you your phone number Dont despair if he doesntâhe may see giving you his as a more subtle way to show hes interested If he gives you his text him immediately with your name so that he has your number After giving your number give him a smile and say something along the lines of âGive me a call sometime we can hang out Pay attention to how often he calls or texts you If he texts you a lot thats definitely a sign that hes interested If he never texts you he may be shy Dont be afraid to make the first move hereâits possible that hes just waiting for your text If you text him on multiple occasions and he doesnt respond though its probably a sign that hes not into you   If the boy asks you if you like anyone or if you have a crush on anyone then this is a dead giveaway that he has a crush on you He may be asking because heâs jealous or nervous that you like other guys or because heâs secretly hoping that youâll say that you like him This may not be the most subtle way for him to go about it but most boys donât know better If heâs always teasing you or bothering you about whether or not you like someone then it may be because he has a crush on you   However there is one exception to this rule He may be asking you if you like someone because one of his friends likes you and heâs really asking for him See if he has a friend who is always eyeing you and who you may think could have a crush on you instead   If the boy is always telling you that none of the girls he knows are good enough for him or that none of them are as smart pretty or interesting as you then this may be his way of telling you that youâre the right girl for him If heâs gone on dates with girls and tells you that he didnât really like them or if heâs always just telling you about how other girls never measure up then this may be his way of telling you that youâre really the one for him   Just make sure this doesnât mean he has you in the Friend Zone If heâs asking you for advice on his dating life then it may be because he just looks at you as a friend But if he just âcomplainsâ to you about how he canât find the right girl then he may be telling you that he has a crush on you   Another sign that the boy has a crush on you is that he always finds a way to give you a compliment He may not say something as obvious as âYou look so beautiful todayâ But he may tell you that your dress is a pretty color that he likes your new earrings or that he thinks your new shoes are awesome Just the fact that he notices how you look what you do or what youâre wearing shows that he pays attention to you and that he probably has a crush on you   He may also compliment things like how awesome you are at sports how smart you are in class or how much he loves your jokes Though some guys are more shy about complimenting character traits or talents instead of just sticking to the more obvious things this can also be a way for him to show that he has a crush on you   Another sign that he has a crush on you is that heâs always asking what youâre up to over the weekend He may really be asking because he wants to make sure that youâre not going on a date because heâs feeling jealous He could also be asking as a way of asking you to hang out with him or because heâs hoping that youâll ask him to hang out with you If he wants to know what youâre doing away from school then itâs probably because he wants to be a part of it   He may just say something simple like âAre you doing anything fun this weekendâ If you say youâre not then he may use this as a good time to ask you to hang out If he does that then thereâs a good chance he has a crush on you Watch his face when he asks you what youâre up to over the weekend If you say youâre hanging out with girlfriends then you should see if thereâs a noticeable relief on his face because youâre not hanging out with any boys   If a boy has a crush on you then he may open up to you about some of the stuff heâs been thinking and feeling He could tell you about his favorite pet his siblings his friendships or even his dreams for the future If you find him telling you some things that seem personal and if he even says something like âI donât tell many people thisâ or âNot a lot of people know that about meâ then itâs a sign that he thinks youâre special If he has a crush on you then he may open up to you more than he would to most people   If he doesnât really open up to you it doesnât mean that he doesnât like you It just means that heâs a bit more shy   If the boy has a crush on you then he may be more nervous around you than he would be around other girls This may lead him to laugh a lot more around you than he normally would He may laugh really hard at something you say thatâs barely funny or he may even laugh slightly at something you said that wasnât meant to be funny at all The next time youâre together pay attention to how much he laughs around you and see if he laughs more than normal If so then it may be because he has a crush on you   Study him when heâs around other people Is he just the type of guy who is always laughing or does he laugh more around you If his laughter is reserved for you then it may be because he has a crush on you You can also see if he always goes out of his way to make you laugh If he seems to crack more jokes around you than anyone else or if he just seems to try harder then it may be because he has a crush on you   Itâs only natural that if a boy likes you heâll go out of his way to touch you more If youâre sitting next to each other and your knees or legs are touching or if he keeps âaccidentallyâ touching your feet with his then it may be because he likes you If youâre in a group setting and he tends to playfully push or shove you a lot to poke you or just to touch you in some other silly way then this may also be a sign that he has a crush on you   Take a look at what he does the next time youâre together Does he end up subtly touching you or brushing up against you a few times If so then he may have a crush on you Of course if heâs really shy then he may not try to touch you and may even be a little bit intimidated when heâs near you   This can be another sign that the boy has a crush on you If you look over at him during math class and catch him looking at you or if you see him looking at you all the way across the cafeteria then it may mean that he has a crush on you If he blushes and looks away or just seems embarrassed that youâve âcaughtâ him staring at you then itâs even more likely that he has a crush on you   The downside is that if youâre always trying to catch him staring at you heâll start to think that youâre the one who has a crush on him But thatâs true isnât it   The next time you talk to the guy see if he turns his chest shoulders and feet toward you and if he generally points his body in your direction If he has a crush on you then heâll want to be closer to you and to be absorbed in what youâre saying He may even lean toward you to get closer during conversation If heâs turned away from you has his arms crossed or is angling his shoulders in the opposite direction then he may not have a crush on you after all Though body language isnât everything it really can help you get a sense of whether a boy has a crush on you or not   Of course it can also help to observe the boy with other people See if his body language is more open toward you than it is with others If he just always crosses his arms over his chest when he talks to people then it wonât mean anything bad if he does it around you   Fidgeting is a prime sign of nervousness If the guy tends to play with the drawstring of his hoodie pick at his nails brush away an imaginary spot on his shirt or kick at nothing when heâs around you then it may be because he likes you and feels nervous The next time you talk see if he moves his arms and other body parts around more than usual If so then this may mean that he has a crush around you because heâs nervous about how he should act when youâre together   He may also play with his phone or just look at it just for something to do This may not mean that heâs bored and wants to talk to someone else but that heâs just nervous about talking to you   If you see the guy fixing his hair looking in a mirror or reflective surface brushing a spot off his shoes or adjusting his shirt or pants a bit when heâs around you then it may be because he has a crush on you and is nervous about looking his best The next time you talk see if he acts a bit selfconscious about his appearance If he does then it may be because he likes you and wants to look his best   Think about it you tend to spend more time looking in the mirror before you see your crush donât you Guys feel the same way If the boy likes you then he may be wondering about how he looks right in the middle of talking to you   This is one of the biggest giveaways that the guy likes you If you walk into a room whether itâs a classroom or a birthday party and his face lights up his eyes get bigger and a smile spreads across his face then this may mean that he has a crush on you He may not come over to you immediately and he may act more coy about how he feels but this first reaction shows that he really may have a crush on you after all   His face may light up and he may turn away or try to play it cool instead of coming up to you immediately But if you see the initial look in his eyes youâll know his true feelings   If a boy really has a crush on you then heâll be likely to give you all of his attention Heâll turn his body toward you make eye contact and wonât look around for his other friends or text them during your conversation unless he uses his phone as a crutch because heâs nervous If his friends walk by and he doesnât even see them or if he doesnât keep looking around the room then itâs because he has a crush on you and is completely absorbed by you   The next time you talk see if he gives you all of his attention If he looks at you closely responds to what you say and seems really engaged then he may have a crush on you However he may also be so nervous that he may zone out because heâs so busy worrying about what to say next
If he has another girlfriend he may stop spending as much time in the bedroom with you but it could also make him want to have more sex Here are some things to look   If youre having a really long dry spell If he never wants to have sex anymore he may be getting it somewhere else If he suddenly has a voracious sexual appetite If he wants to have sex all the time all of a sudden it may be because his sex drive has gone up from sleeping with another lady If he tries a ton of new moves in bed He could be picking these up from another girl   Your boyfriend may have some serious guilt because hes cheating on you and this will actually make him much nicer to you If you find that suddenly hes helping out around the house a lot more or doing a ton of favors for you he may be doing it to compensate   If he cleans your apartment fixes your car or buys your groceries and has never done those things before there may be a reason for it If hes always asking if theres any way he can help If hes suddenly Mr Romance and brings you candy and flowers especially after a long period where he was distant   If your boyfriend never cared about the state of his car or apartment but now hes taking hours to clean it he may be doing it to clean up for another lady or to hide evidence of her   If his car used to be messy and is now spotless he may be keeping it fresh for another lady If his apartment is much cleaner than it used to be and if he always says he needs some time to clean up he may be cleaning it to get rid of evidence of his other girl If you really want to find out if hes cheating on you come over when he says he is cleaning his apartment and see what hes really up to If he uses air freshener in his car or home He may be using it to hide the smell of his lead lady   Whether he seems to always be in a good mood or is just moody all the time instead of his usual evenkeeled self then something is up Pay attention to his mood to see if something is up   If hes sometimes in a ridiculously good mood like hes walking on sunshine for no apparent reason If hes grinning ear to ear and looking off into the distance like hes remembering a fond memory with another girl then chances are his good mood has nothing to do with you If hes suddenly in a terrible mood If everything seems fine and hes suddenly furious or very upset especially after a phone call or text message then another girl may have had something to do with it   Shady behavior is pretty easy to spot and if hes doing at least a few shady things then it can only add up to him sneaking around to spend time with another girl Here are some signs   If hes spending a lot of time texting and on the phone If he stops texting or ends his phone call as soon as you leave the room If hes suddenly spending a lot of time online This could be a sign that hes chatting it up with another girl If he slams his computer shut when you walk into a room that is a bad sign If he disappears for hours and is just incommunicado for a day a night or even a weekend If he cant take the time to answer your call or just send you a quick message then he may be with another girl If he shuts his phone off for hours on end Why else would he do that

that youre always up to something new He should think that you have a busy life and should feel lucky that you have time to talk to him through texting If he feels like you spend all your time waiting around for a text from him then hell quickly lose interest   Show that you have a life Let him know when youre going out with friends taking a karate class or watching a new movie Hell know that your

to end the conversation Mix things up and make sure that youre the one who has to go at least half the time   You shouldnt just end the conversation by saying See ya Instead you should leave the conversation open so it will be easy for you to chat again This can be as simple as telling him youre looking forward to seeing him or letting him know about something interesting that youre doing so he can ask about it later Heres how to do it   If youve already started casually seeing each other theres no harm in letting him know that youre excited to see him If youve started hooking up tell him that you cant wait to show him the new lingerie you bought for your date Leave him with a sexy image in his mind so hell be anticipating your new panties Tell him where you have to go If youre going to a concert of a band you both like tell him so he can ask about it later Leave an opening for him to ask you out Casually mention that youre going out with a few friends and that it would be fun to hang out with him If he wants to see you and isnt too shy he may ask   The last thing a guy wants is a girl who is too needy If youre already showing signs that youre needy over texts then he will have no doubt that youre even needier in person Your texts should be fun and breezy and should not make him feel like you want something from him Heres what not to do   Dont ever say Did you get my text Unless his phone was stolen then yes he got your text and he didnt feel like answering Dont make the situation more uncomfortable than it needs to be You can ask about his weekend but dont ask if he hooked up with another girl or if he saw any cute girls out at the bar last night This will just make you look jealous and a little creepy Dont send him a question mark if he doesnt respond to your text This will make him feel like youre breathing over his shoulder and that youre desperate to hear from him   Your texts should let your guy know that youre into him and that youre a cool chick to talk to Your texts should not make the guy feel like youre obsessing over talking to him and that youre at his back and call and are willing to put your life on hold to respond to him Here are some things you should not do to avoid looking too eager   Dont say You there if he hasnt responded in five minutes Dont text him twice or three times in a row Wait for him to respond first Dont respond too quickly You dont want it to look like youre just waiting around for a text from him If hes taken four hours to respond to you dont fire back an answer as soon as you hear from him Take six hours to respond to him â or even seven Dont keep the conversation going when he clearly wants to stop If hes only giving you one word answers or barely answering lay off Dont use too many emoticons The occasional winky face or smiley face will let him know youre flirting but a million exclamation marks or smiley faces will scare him off Dont text him when youre supposed to be having fun If youre out with your girlfriends or at a party you can send him the occasional text to let him know youre thinking of him but dont make him think that you dont know how to have fun because youre too busy being tied to your phone   The last thing you want to do when youre texting a guy you like is to completely embarrass yourself Once you embarrass yourself through your texts it may be hard to strike up a conversation again and even harder to build a relationship with the person you like Here are some things you should not do   Avoid revealing how you really feel about him Texting is the time to be cute and to further your relationship Its not the time to pour your heart out This is something you can do in person once the time is right Telling him how much you like him via text will make you look a bit desperate and afraid of having a real conversation in person Dont text him nine times in a row with your deep feelings If he has stepped away from the phone for a while and returns to a filled inbox he will just be freaked out  Do not send him nude photos Even if your relationship has progressed and youve had some sexy time this is the stupidest thing you can do Not only may he think youre too forward but if you dont know him that well he can end up being a creep and may hold it against you later

Asking it directly might be too awkward Just start a relevant conversation like Hey You know name already has a girlfriend boyfriend How nice I wish I could have one Then if that person responds then keep going Sooner or later you will ask  Hey who do you like by the way  Play truth or dare first If that person chooses truth ask them the question But if they choose dare just ask that person to do something like shout aloud the name of your crush   If they are telling the truth that means they are available If that person just says nobody confidently and with no hesitation then that person is telling the truth That is good   Dont worry you will find the time to comfort them Just dont get overprotective or lay claims often times looking down at the floor may mean they like somebody out of their league and is just working up the courage to talk to them Interfering out of your own self interest can bring you guys from friends to acquaintances in no time If you really like that person it is better to remain friends were you can learn more about them than having them push you away because it is too awkward for them   Or they are just shy to tell their secret crush Dont put to much stock in this and it is best to say immediately its OK you dont have to tell and to laugh it off and then try to get it some other way   Again unless the person feels like telling the truth it is very easy to say either nobody or the name of the hottest person in the class to throw you off track   They might just confess to you   Good luck And remember dont get obsessive or they will figure it out really fast Truth or dare is the best way but if you are there it might discourage them from being truthful and if you are reasonably sure they like you just ask them out It is easier and less of a strain to get it over with no matter how awkward it will be We have all been there
The best art investors do their research on the pieces of art that they buy so someone with some education or interest in the art world is more likely to understand this niche market As well as personal research you will need to have contacts with people in the art world such as auctioneers gallery directors and dealers who can give you good investment advice  You may confuse these three terms if you are not careful Each of them has a slightly different goal in mind when looking to buy art   Art collectors do not buy art for investment purposes They buy it to decorate and display in their home Because they consider them to be an important part of their home or life most art collectors have a hard time parting with pieces of their collection While many collectors do end up selling some pieces of art it may be done because of necessity Collectors often loan their works out to museums and occasionally donate them to museums upon their death Art investors seek to diversify their portfolio with an art investment Some investment firms put about two and a half to three percent of their investment money in art They seek good advice and often buy paintings that are older and have been popular historically such as paintings by the Old Masters These investments are kept over decades and sold off when the market is right with the investor seeking to get a six to ten percent profit rise per year These investments are also often made to be given as inheritance to future generations of the family Art investment is often undertaken by the very wealthy Art speculators try to invest in art that they believe will appreciate in value They aim to buy art at a low price from budding artists in the beginning of their careers Then they hope to sell their work in 10 to 15 years when the artists are at the peak of their careers and people or collectors are willing to pay much more for their pieces This is a type of investment that takes intimate involvement with the art world and liquidity in order to buy the art   Art investments should be no more than a small part of your investment portfolio along with stocks bonds new businesses and more Figure out what your range is before you begin to pick out potential pieces and get advice from investors and art dealers   Study the Mei Moses Fine Art Index to get a firm grasp of the art market today Although they cannot predict what will be popular in the future they can tell you what art tends to keep its value and be a lowrisk and what art has a more volatile market value   While this is not an absolute rule to follow paintings from successful artists tend to get better returns than sculpture and installation art   Get all the information you can out of them before making a purchase If you are going to buy at auction be prepared to walk away if the price goes higher than your investment range   Beware of art auctioneers or dealers that promise too high a return on paintings In many ways they are just like stock brokers and other financial investment firms who may promise anything to get a sale They should be found trustworthy before you buy anything because ponzi schemes and art market bubbles are part of this investment landscape as well If you have never bought art in an auction environment before you may want to seek advice about how it is done properly You should study the auction booklet before hand learn about secret buyers and how prices can quickly inflate Most fine auction houses would be willing to teach you the basics if they see you as a serious investor   Arrange for payment shipping and insurance Each piece of art should be insured and catalogued as part of your estate   In order for an art investment to retain its value it should be kept at lowhumidity and avoid being marred You may choose to hang it in your home but you may want to get an art collectors advice about where to hang it and how to care for it   Share this information with your children if it is intended as an inheritance investment They need to be well aware of how to take care of art or they may lose money or ruin the painting entirely   As well as keeping tabs on the art world to understand the rise and falls of certain schools of art an appraiser can tell you how your investment is maturing They may clue you in on when you have reached your desired profit   If the art you buy does not fit in your home and you will only be storing it research banks hotels and other institutions that rent fine art on a rotating basis You may be able to demand thousands of dollars per year for your art to hang in another building Keep in mind you will need to make sure your art is covered by an insurance policy for loss or damage   Make sure the renter provides insurance for your art You should prepare a contract that stipulates the time allotted the fee the insurance and the shipment of your art   Unless you employ an art dealer or auction house at the exact moment when the art is in high value it can take years and thousands of dollars in fees to find the right buyer

It can be scary to start up a conversation with your crush It may feel silly to you but may be people find rehearsing what to say ahead of time can help If youre unsure how to approach your crush stand in front of the mirror in your home and practiceTry to think of ways to start a conversation Where do you normally see this person If you have class together you can practice asking him about a homework assignment or making a comment on the latest test You dont have to plan what youll say wordforword In fact rehearsing too much may make your conversation sound strained Instead have a general idea of what you want to talk about  Look for observations or comments you can make to get the conversation started There are a variety of ways to begin a conversation Once youre talking you can proceed to keep things flowing allowing you to get to know your crushTry starting with a compliment For example say something like Hey I love your sweater You can also make an observation For example What did you think of that quiz yesterday I thought it was really tough You can ask a question For example Do you know when that report is due I forgot to write it down Try to approach him in comfortable situations If hes not distracted it will be easier to get his attention   Once you start talking ask some questions It can be difficult to establish a smooth flow of conversation at first One helpful tip to remember is that people generally enjoy talking about themselves If you want your crush to keep talking ask him questions This can also help you get to know him betterAsk him about things you have in common at first For example What do you think of this class and Do you think youll go to the football games this season Once youre in a conversation try to ask more broad questions that relate to the topic at hand If you end up discussing a movie you watched in class say something like What kind of movies do you like in general   During the initial conversation you dont want to overdo it Pay attention to how the guy is reacting Wrap up the conversation when it seems to have reached its natural endAfter you exhausted a certain topic you both may get the sense theres little left to discuss The guy may start giving shorter answers This isnt necessarily a sign the guy is not engaged Conversations just have a natural beginning and end Rather than trying to force a conversation to go on longer than it has to try to wrap it up Look for an organic way to exit the conversation For example say something like Well I should head to my next class Ill see you later   You want to be yourself around your crush so dont center all the conversations around him and his interests â let him get to know you too Once youre talking regularly try to look for shared interests to discuss This way youll get to know each other better and bond through common traitsFor example say you find out you both like Dancing With The Stars Try asking him about the latest episodes after they air For example Did you see Dancing With The Stars last night It was so crazy From there you can look for broader topics of shared interests to discuss For example Do you like dancing I just love dancing and musicals   If a conversation is slowing down ask a question Asking someone about themselves will usually keep a conversation interesting This will also give you a sense of whether you want to eventually ask your crush out If you have a lot of shared interests and opinions youre more likely to be compatible You can ask questions likeWhats your favorite movie Do you have any hobbies Whats your favorite subjects in school Whats the coolest place youve ever visited Whos your favorite television character   When you really like someone it can be very tempting to try and be the type of person you think they would be interested in dating For instance if the guy is really sporty but you could care less about sports you might be tempted to pretend youre also a big fan Avoid this Dont deny your own interests hobbies and friends out of fear of judgement or rejection You can be polite about it Oh Im not really into football and use it as an opportunity to help him learn a little about you I actually really love going to see live musicIt can be hard to keep this in mind when you are crushing hard but remember that someone who doesnt like you for who you really are ultimately isnt a good match for you   If you get his number texting can be a great form of communication that can help you get to know him better Try to text him once in awhile and see how he responds This can help you see if he likes you as well A guy who texts back eagerly is more likely to be interestedBe yourself when you text If he asks you questions give honest answers Use your own unique voice and sense of humor Throw in an occasional emoji Dont overdo it but a few smiley faces now and then can come off as flirty Allow him to initiate texting on occasion You dont want to overwhelm him   As youre getting to know a guy try to do some light flirting This will convey your interest and allow you to get a sense of whether a guy likes you If he flirts back its likely hes interestedSmile Smiling is contagious Keeping eyecontact while smiling is key This keeps the tension in the air flirty and fun A smile to a guy gives him motivation to pursue you Give him a brief smile and then look away Make eye contact This will convey interest Try to introduce gentle touch Lightly brush his arm when youre talking to him for example   Some topics can tank a conversation so they should be avoided If youre trying to get to know a potential romantic interest stay away from topics that may make him uncomfortableAvoid putting yourself down You want to show that you like yourself and youre not insecure Never say anything negative about his friends or family   Before you ask someone out its a good idea to see if theyre interested as well If the guy doesnt seem at all invested it may be a good idea to stick to being friendsA guy whos interested will often show this in his body language He will lean towards you when he talks make eye contact and smile frequently People often subtly mirror one anothers body language when theyre interested in someone A guy may for example cross his legs when you do If a guy makes excuses to touch you this is a sign of attraction He may brush your arm give you a hug or try to touch you in other ways It may also help to notice if he acts different around you then he does other people This may suggest he likes you and may even go against the normal signs For instance if he is usually very flirty with just about everyone but is more quiet and shy around you this may actually be because he is nervous around you Keep in mind that none of these are definite signs he is interested   Sometimes its best just to be straightforward It can be scary to confess your feelings however if you think the guy is interested its easier to just come out and say so instead of beating around the bushKeep it simple Say something like So I really like you a lot I was wondering if you feel the same way Take a few deep breaths before going into the conversation This will help you stay calm   If it goes well ask the guy out on a date Say something like Do you want to see a movie tonight or Do you want to go to the school dance with me It can be hard to make the first move but if your feelings are shared thats somewhat easier You can never be 100 sure if someone is interested in you Even if you think youve read the signs correctly theres always a chance a guy will not return your affections If this is the case try to accept this and move onIf the guy turns you down dont question him or get angry Say something like Oh ok Im disappointed but I understand Then you can excuse yourself and walk away Seek out support from friends and family members Find someone to vent your disappointment towards Do something nice for yourself in the wake of disappointment Buy yourself a new item of clothing or other treat Take a day off to watch a movie with a friend
Sooner or later you need to commit to either talking to your crush about the way you feel or staying silent Being undecided about a crush is a terrible feeling Making a decision can be scary but it gives you closure You get to either take things to the next level with your crush or start moving on but either way you dont have to worry about it anymore   Often honesty is the best policy Being open about your crush can feel like taking a huge weight off your chest â no matter what happens you were true to your heart It also lets you avoid nagging feelings of regret In other words you wont be wondering What would have happened if I had talked to my crush in a few weeks Try explaining to him that you dont want to ruin the friendship and you wouldnt like it to be awkward Usually he would accept that and try to keep things as normal as they were before whilst deciding his next move On the other hand if you really dont want to open up about your crush or you have good reason to think its a bad idea you shouldnt ever feel like you need to An example of a situation where it would be a bad idea to act on a crush is if your crush is already with someone else   If you decide that youre going to open up to your crush dont waste time waiting for the perfect moment It probably will never come In the meantime your crush may lose interest or even start to think that you dont like him anymore Pick a time and place where you can be alone with your crush and stick to this Your best chances for romance will come if you seize the opportunities you are given   For example if your crush is someone you know from school you might arrange to meet this person after school in a secluded spot It doesnt have to be 100 deserted â just reasonably private A park bench for instance will usually work fine   Opening up to your crush doesnt have to be a huge dramatic production In fact if you make a big deal about it you may even scare your crush off Instead keep the conversation lowpressure and casual This will make it much easier for him to give you an honest answer   You dont even have to outright say that you have a crush Instead you can simply invite him to spend oneonone time together For example you might start the conversation by saying something like Hey Spanish class has been fun Do you want to get some lunch and go to the fair with me this weekend I hear the enchiladas they have out there are amazing   Even if you keep things very lowpressure your crush might get a little shy Dont worry about this Dont take silence or awkwardness as a sign that he doesnt like you These things just show that he is having a hard time getting his words out Give him plenty of time to take in what youre saying and encourage him to come to a conclusion when hes ready   He shouldnt even feel like he needs to answer you right away Getting a date offer or having someone admit they like you can take a day or two to fully process Consider saying something like Take your time â you dont have to tell me today   Respect your crushs ability to come to his own decisions even if you dont like the one he makes If he says no just casually say Oh OK and make your exit Dont pester him with repeated questions or try to get him to change his mind On the other hand if he does accept your offer congratulations   After a no you may want to limit the amount of time you spend with this person for a couple days You dont have to outright ignore him but if your feelings are hurt or if its hard to stop thinking about it give yourself some distance for a little while until your emotions die down

That way your crush will be looking at either you or the teacher Either way its in your general direction   If they give you an honest answer then you have their attention   If you are still feeling shy then talk to a different friend Ask them subtly about your crush what heshe likes and what they do Now you know what they like and you may find a connection between them and you Maybe you both enjoy the same music or something   Talk directly to them with a smile and be yourself Dont share anything really weird that you may do with your crush though If its something like eating toothpaste in your spare time then he may not want to know you very well   Talk to each other frequently and dont be afraid to ask them some questions Maybe you could plan a gettogether at your house or theirs This will build an even deeper foundation in a relationship if you hang out a bit   The parents may either like you or hate you You of course want the first choice Talk with them about school or how they have such a lovely kitchen However if its not a lovely kitchen dont mention it   Dont just throw these questions out though And never say I love you at this time Only when you both feel romantic may you say something like Youre really prettyhandsome   Dont be afraid to sayI like them and heshe likes me
Though guineas should really get vegetables every day your guinea will likely see them as treats They love digging into fresh vegetables Romaine lettuce and spinach are a great base for your guineas treat Your guinea pig should have a cup of vegetables and fruit a day and greens should make up most of that cup In fact most days it can just be greens You can add pieces of zucchini sweet potato parsley and carrots as toppings However dont make them the bulk of their diet and change up what you feed your guinea pig from day to day Try to only feed other vegetables a couple of times a week Any vegetable if feed to excess every day can potentially cause problems For example carrots are high in oxalate which if fed daily can predispose the GP to developing oxalate bladder stones A good rule of thumb is to never feed the same food two days running which prevents mineral buildupYou can also feed your guinea pig asparagus basil carrots with tops or without celery chicory cilantro eggplant cucumber dill parsley parsnips radishes rocket bell peppers turnips tomatoes and watercressRemove seeds when possible Skip rhubarb potatoes and tomato leaves completely as they contain substances called alkaloids which are toxic to guinea pigsFeed a limited number of vegetables in the cabbage family such as cabbage broccoli Brussels sprouts bok choy and cauliflower as it can cause your guinea pig to bloat Only offer these once in awhile in small amounts While guinea pigs can eat fruit they should only eat in small doses because of the high sugar content You can feed your guinea pig a wide variety of fruits but try to remove the seeds when possibleYou can feed your guinea pigs apples and pears in small slices with peels berries such as blueberries and blackberries citrus fruits such as oranges and grapefruit melons such as cantaloupe and watermelon kiwi mango peaches nectarines and plums Banana is also fine in limited amountsYou can also give them dried fruits such as apricots and dates but only give them in small pieces as they are high in sugar You can give them a quarter of an orange for instance or add bell peppers or asparagus though leafy greens also provide vitamin C Rub the fruits and vegetables under running water to remove bacteria pesticides and other harmful substances from the surface To be safe wash homegrown vegetables as well since car exhaust and other particles in the air can gather on vegetationDont dry the food off Leaving the water on it gives your guinea pig more fresh water Greens dont need to be chopped You can leave leaves whole but pull them off the stalks If you feed the stocks you need to treat them as you do other vegetables by chopping them   Its usually best to remove seeds from fruits and vegetables as they arent always good for your guinea pig That includes tomatoes cucumbers bell peppers and apples Chop the treats into chunks to make them easier for guinea pigs to eat This step is especially important for stringy vegetables such as celery its stringiness can cause the guinea pig to choke if its not small enough Therefore make sure you slice up celery small For other vegetables humansized bites are fine even slices of cucumberFor extra fun you can present it as a salad in a bowl   Uneaten food quickly spoils Make sure to take it out of the cage after an hour so that your guinea pig wont get sick Your guinea pig needs hay for digestion However to make it a bit more fun you can stuff it in a cardboard toilet paper tube Your guinea pig will have fun pulling out of the tube You can also add a small scoop of rolled oats to their regular pellets The oats make the food more interesting and your guinea pigs will see it as a treat
On the other hand if she starts the conversation too often she might not be interested either When a girl likes a guy she will likely try to show her interest without being too obvious or looking too needy As a result she will start at least half of your conversations if not most but probably wont start all of them If a girl does start all of them it could be a sign that she is not worried about seeming needy because she only sees you as a friend  Even if the girl is tempted to hang on your every word most girls will resist the urge If anything a girl who likes you is more likely to end a text conversation first in an effort to show that she is interesting and has an engaging social life even without you When a girl ends most texting conversations with something like Gotta go Im heading to movie with my bff she could be interested If however she just stops texting instead of saying goodbye she is probably not interested   A formal count is not necessary of course but make a mental note of how often she uses emoticons and which ones she uses most The most often used emoticon a girl will flirt with is the winking face The more often she uses an emoticon wink the more likely it is that she has a thing for you Standard smiles may or may not mean the same thing but large smiles are another good sign A blushing emoticon and a kiss face emoticon may also frequent her texts if she likes you   If she quickly turns the conversation to herself she might not be interested Similarly if she gives super quick answers like K or frequently leaves the conversation with little more than a brb she probably is not very interested If she regularly jokes back with you when you say something funny though or asks you questions to keep the conversation it demonstrates that she wants to keep talking to you for as long as possible   If most of her texts are practical such as question about assignments then she may not be interested On the other hand if her texts are personal and ask about your personal life she might be interested This is especially true if she recalls specific details you previously mentioned to her about your plans Another promising type of text is the random question Look for something of no significance like Would you rather live on nothing but your least favorite food for a year or give up your favorite food for the rest of your life These questions are fairly unimportant and if she asks a bunch of them it could be a sign that she is looking for an excuse to talk to you because you are on her mind   Specifically look at how often she uses exclamation points More exclamation points indicates more excitement at the opportunity to talk to you which could signify that she likes you A Hey you is infinitely more promising than a simple Hey   Not every girl does it but many girls add extra vowels and consonants onto words For instance she might text words like heyyyy riiiiiight pleeeeeaaassseee hiiiiii or byyyyeee The idea is to mimic the elongation of words often used in reallife flirtatious banter   Any text laughter is a good sign but there are some that are better signs than others Standard abbreviations like LOL ROTFL or LMAO can be sent to just about anyone friend or crush alike A haha is a better sign because she wants you to actually imagine her laughing A hehe or teehee is even better These two forms of text laughing are the equivalent of a reallife giggle rather than a loud laugh and a girl is more likely to text you a giggle if she wants to sound cute   A common hint dropped via text is the invitation to meet in person An actual invite to a party is good but an even better invitation is the random âon the flyâ sort in which she casually mentions something like âI think Iâll head to the pool Meet me thereâ These messages may seem casual but in actuality they usually indicate that she wants to see you and only you and now A strong desire to see you is a pretty good hint that she is interested
No one will know what kind of person your crush is looking for better than his friends Get to know them and youâll find out more about him like where he tends to hang out On top of that if they get to know you and are impressed theyâre more likely to want to help you with your crush If the two of you have mutual friends they are the perfect people to talk to Think of the following examples when subtly trying to find out more about your crush   If you want to know where he skates ask about parks in town âWhere do people usually skate around here Who goes to that parkâ If you want try and know whether your crush is single âHow come he doesnât have a girlfriendboyfriendâ Ask about their friendship with him âHow did you guys become friends What do you do togetherâ  If you want to understand your crush better donât be afraid to learn about skater culture Like any other culture skateboarding culture has a set of values norms and ideals The best way to find out more is to talk to skateboarders about why they skateboard and what it brings to them You can also find many interviews on YouTube where skateboarders talk about the culture This can give you a great idea of how your crush thinks   Beyond understanding the culture youâll want to learn a bit about skateboarding itself You donât necessarily need to know all the tricks or professional skateboarders by name but knowing a bit about your crushâs passion will give the two of you something to talk about Simply knowing what an ollie is jumping with the skateboard will show that you care about his passion and heâll be impressed when itâs time to talk to him   Skater guys tend to spend most of their free time at the skatepark of their choice with their friends Give yourself the opportunity to âbump into himâ by hovering around his favorite hang out spot   First impressions matter it can take only three seconds for your crush to make up his mind about you the first time he meets youThere are two main ways you can introduce yourself depending on how quickly you want to make your intentions known   You can be extremely casual if you donât want him to know you like him just yet âHey whatâs going on mind if I hang out with youâ You can be completely blunt and honest This lets you know right away if heâs interested in you and you can put a comedic twist on it as well âHey I like you Want to hang outâ   People love to talk about themselves and their passions Asking questions shows that you have more than just a passing interest in what he has to say Some questions you might want to ask him include   âHow long have you been skateboardingâ This shows your interest in what he does and learning more about him âHow often do you hang out hereâ Not only will this tell you how passionate he is about skateboarding but gives you a chance to know when you can next bump into him âWhat do you do when youâre not skateboardingâ This gives you a chance to find out about common interests the two of you might share   Even if youâre not interested in skateboarding you should still pay very close attention to what your crush is saying Active listening means youâre paying attention to what heâs saying asking important questions that show youâre listening and absorbing the information heâs giving you It might sound strange to do this at first but people definitely appreciate someone who isnât on their phone while theyâre trying to have a conversation   Not only will being positive and supportive bring him up and let him enjoy spending time with you but it actually makes you more attractive to himTry to see things in a positive light and avoid nagging about your insecurities Thereâs nothing wrong with having insecurities but donât let them affect your actions   Skaters by nature like to play around goof off and take risksGet in touch with your playful side to reel him in it shows that you donât take yourself too seriously and will make you irresistibleBe willing to step out of your comfort zone and let your your rebellious side out Think of the following examples   Donât always play it safe Skateboarders like to take risks try doing the same within reason Try an extreme sport or explore an abandoned building Experiment Leave your comfort zone and try things you were too scared to try Conquer your fears and be adventurous Go on spontaneous road trips or try a new hobby Playful teasing Thereâs a fine line between mocking someone âThat trick really suckedâ and teasing them âIs that the best youâve got to show meâ   Style is all about making the clothes work for you and skater guys respect confidence Donât feel that you have to dress up or dress down just to impress him but keep in mind that if youâre hanging out with him at the skatepark you may need more functional clothing Think jeans and sneakers but you can wear jeans that flatter you and you find stylish   No one likes a poser especially not a skateboarder Being yourself will give you an infectious confidence that will get him to pay attention Use these steps to guide you into bringing out qualities you already possess donât try to become someone else because you want to impress a guy Heâll see right through you if you try to be something youâre not   This is a great way to gain some shared experiences with your crush and get the opportunity to hang out with him Ask him if heâll show you how to skateboard sometime You might even like skateboarding giving you something in common with him If you already skateboard even better Take the opportunity to ride with him showing off the tricks you can pull off in a friendly competition
Typically an increase an eye contact is a good sign that someone is into you Itâs particularly good if they hold eye contact for a while and donât look away   Continuously locking eyes with you is her way of letting you know its ok to approach herKeep in mind that girls who are shy may not make eye contact as often If you know sheâs shy donât take a lack of eye contact as a sign that she doesnât like you  An easy gesture to understand and to watch for is flirtatious behavior and touchingIf sheâs suddenly touching your shoulder or brushing her hand against yours chances are sheâs into you   Asking for a hug before you part ways is another good indication of her feelings Some women are more subtle in their approach They may ask you to help them out or want to show you something on their phone This is their way of closing the physical gap between the two of you Be aware that not all physical contact is a sign that she likes you A girl may tap you on the shoulder or ask for a friendly hug without having other intentions Its important to look for other signs in addition to physical contact   Whether sheâs making fun of your hair or giving you a hard time about always being late teasing can be a sign of affection Teasing followed by a smile is even better   If her teasing is followed by a smile shes probably just trying to be playful She may tease you about your age past girlfriends or hobbies This is her way of trying to get a reaction from you Being mean or hurtful is not a sign that sheâs into you so donât waste your time on someone who puts you down   Of all the clues she might be giving you facial expressions are some of the easiest to understand and to readIf she seems to light up when you come into the room you can probably rest assured that the feelings are mutual   If shes always smiling when you look at her or even when youre not this is a sure sign that sheâs attracted to youSmiling and laughter go hand in hand If you notice her laughing at all of your jokes even when theyâre not funny this is her way of affirming your feelings   If she suddenly sends friend requests to all of your social media accounts chances are that sheâs trying to get to know you better   You may see numerous requests from her all at once If she not only wants to be your friend on Facebook but would like to follow you on Twitter as well this is a definite sign If she mentions that you can find her on Facebook or should connect on Instagram thatâs probably a good sign that she likes you A girl who likes you may take an interest in your friends as well Find out if your buddies have received friend requests from her   Whether itâs a status âlikeâ or a message that just says hey if you see a sudden increase in activity from the girl you like sheâs definitely sending you a sign that she has a crush on you   For the shy girls this may be one of the best ways to determine if they like you Social media provides people with the opportunity to open up in a less intimidating environment Look for an increase in private messages Similar to texting if someone is replying to you quickly theyâre giving you a clue as to how much you matter You may notice that she posts and tags a lot of pictures of the two of you together This may be her way of telling other girls to back off because she wants to be your girlfriend   You may notice that sheâs broadcasting her newly single status If she seems happy about it and is trying to draw attention to the fact that sheâs currently single this may be her way of letting you know sheâs ready to mingle   If youâre uncertain as to how she feels about her newly single status try sending her a private message If she responds quickly and includes many positive emoticons sheâs trying to let you know sheâs more than ok   If you feel more comfortable broaching your feelings with a girl via social media send her a private message Let her know how you feel about her and wait for a response   Though were in the habit of sharing our thoughts and feelings via social media that doesnt mean you should broadcast your feelings publiclySend her a private message instead of putting your feelings out there for all of the world to knowIf the girl is shy this may be a good way of reaching out to her on a platform that shes comfortable with This also gives the girl a chance to thoughtfully consider her response to your feelings should she not share your affections   If sheâs canceling plans with other guys to hang out with you keep that in mind If you notice shes not as quick to talk about her latest beau either chances are she views you as more than a friend and wants to be in a relationship   This is particularly true if she has talked about other guy crushes in the past but suddenly changes the subject if you mention them When she stops viewing you as one of the girls and refuses to share anything about her love life you can rest assured that the feelings are mutual   In the past you used to be able to get her take on your love life Now she seems to blow up at the mere mention of another woman If this happens itâs probably safe to assume that she wants to be your only leading lady   She may tease you about past relationships but if you mention someone you currently like it may not go over wellPast relationships may be her way of teasing you but mentioning a recent crush will ensure she wonât be smiling for long   In the past you were more likely to hang out in a group setting Now that she keeps asking to spend time alone with you this may be a clue sheâs into you   If youre being consistently invited to places that her past boyfriends accompanied her to such as weddings or dances you should probably have a discussion about whether youâre more than friends   If shes a good friend she will appreciate your honesty Though it may be awkward at first youll ultimately feel relieved once youve been honest   Tell her how you feel While it could be awkward and you may feel extremely nervous about revealing your feelings to her youll be glad you did it Its much better to say something than to not say anything at allYou may notice a look of relief on her face when you share your feelings with her If she lights up when you tell her about your feelings it is probable that she feels the same way Begin the conversation by telling her how much you respect your friendship with her and that youve recently been having feelings that are beyond that of a friend Let her know that its ok if she doesnt feel the same way but that you felt it was important to be honest with her and to share how you really feel Dont worry if she doesnt return your sentiments If shes a good friend shell stay friends with you and will be able to joke about it later Most importantly If she doesnt feel the same way as you dont act as if the whole thing was a joke and that you dont really care that much either
If you break the touch barrier hell feel more inclined to take things a step further If he reacts negatively to you touching his hands he might be sensitive nervous or just not ready Watch and learn from his reactions  Make him feel comfortable and confident Dont invade his space or his privacy It just makes things uncomfortable and awkward   Look at him sincerely If he returns the gaze he wants to kiss you too Look from his eyes to his lips slowly and lean in   If he pulls back stop   Notice the key word here is GENTLY No rough movements its awkward   If he leans back in after you both pulled away a bit then he wants to kiss you again Go with it but if he goes too far let him know Press lightly on his chest to get him to let off and tell him youre not comfortable
What facilities are there What needs to be changed Will there need to be renovations made or is it just a matter of sweeping the corridor and picking the manure forks up How long will it take Will it cost money and how much If big things need to be done such as replacing a door of a stall or fencing a meadow ask the proprietors permission first You dont want to get in trouble but they may praise you for pointing out a danger These are especially good in livery stables because its almost certain that people would buy a raffle ticket to help raise money for new equipment in their yard However if you are a private stable get creative Lemonade stands car boots sales and anything else could help you save up some extra cash If you plan on doing things like busking get the local counsels permission first as you may need a licence Gather a team if needed many people would be happy to help and having people that are handy is even better

If you put on a harness make sure it is loose enough You should be able to put a finger or two between the harness and the guinea pig If its too tight it could harm the guinea pigs back over time and chaff under his armpitsIt may not be a good idea to put a harness on at all Some owners have had trouble with harnesses harming guinea pigs backs after theyve worn it several times  If you insist on using a leash make sure you just do it in the yard That is you can use a leash to keep your guinea pig from wandering too far However you need to supervise the guinea pig the whole time A leash isnt license to leave your guinea pig alone outsideAlso dont tug on the leash Just let your guinea pig roam about Make sure the leash is always loose and your guinea pig doesnt get tangled in it   While you can put your guinea pig in a harness its not a good idea to walk it on a leash The tugging sensation can harm the guinea pigs delicate spine very easily In addition most guinea pigs wont take to walking meaning they cant be trained to walk beside you on a leashIn addition guinea pigs can easily slip out of harnesses so they can escape before you can catch them Therefore trying to walk a guinea pig in a street isnt a good idea It could get away from you and be harmed
It can be difficult to figure out emotions or feelings if youre autistic so the first thing to do is to determine if you have a crush on this person Find a way of sorting out what you feel by writing it out or talking about it with a trusted friend and look for any key signs that you might have a crush   Does this person cause a jumble of thoughts to come rushing into your head all at once You could have a crush on them If you want to spend most of your time with this person or if something exciting happens and you wish they were there to see it then you may have a crush If you stim when excited or nervous try to keep an eye on how much youre stimming whenever youre around this person If you start stimming a lot whenever you think of or are around this person then its possible you have a crush If you smile a lot when thinking about them or talking to them you could possibly have a crush If you could previously speak somewhat smoothly around this person and now youre suddenly tripping over your words or are unsure of what to say all the time around them you could have a crush If you are shy around this person and are afraid of the impression youll give off in conversation you probably have a crush If you regularly fantasize about spending time with this person or even things like dating or kissing them you definitely have a crush  If you do have a crush pretending that you dont have a crush isnt a very good course of action While it can seem like a great way of dealing with it when you eventually end up admitting it to yourself itll only end up making it worse Its important to accept your feelings and recognize how you think of this person   Sometimes crushes can make you feel funny or like theres something wrong with you Its important to realize that theres nothing wrong with having a crush on someone and that most people end up getting a crush at some point in their life As long as you respect the person you have a crush on and dont do anything to intentionally make them uncomfortable theres nothing wrong with liking someone   If you dont have a crush theres nothing wrong with that either Not having crushes doesnt mean that youre broken or that theres something the matter with you Its possible you may be aromantic or that you dont feel romantic attraction and theres nothing broken about that   When it comes to crushes theres a lot of conflicting advice  tell or dont tell Be affectionate or just behave normally What you choose to do is often dependent on the factors of the situation but its usually best to take time out to decipher what you think is best   If your crush is significantly older or younger than you it may be best to avoid telling them about your feelings or showing affection You may get taken advantage of or be viewed as creepy   Unfortunately not everyone in the world has good intentions and it can be hard to figure out whom to avoidâespecially if you have a crush Its extremely important to tell who is a friend and whos not as confessing your feelings to your crush may open up a window for you to be taken advantage of and as a result get badly hurt   Dont take this to mean that you should assume everyone is a bad person Many people have good intentions and if they find out you have a crush on them their initial response wont be to hurt you However there are some people in the world with malicious intent and who may want to string you along or play mind games with you For this reason be careful about who you associate with Avoid telling your crush how you feel if they belittle groups of people  for example if they mock people of a different race than them or use autistic as an insult This person probably isnt the kind of person you would want to be in a relationship with no matter if you think they like you back or not

Talking to a girl you like can be nerveracking You can ease some of the stress by having a few things already picked out to talk about before you sit down If you are in the same class you could say something about the teacher or the content of the class itself If you are at lunch or out with friends you might mention a popular movie or the antics of a friend you have in common   âProfessor Fink is so boring I actually like physics but he has a real knack for sucking all the fun out of itâ âHave you seen the latest episode of Supernatural It was rivetingâ âToday is my dogâs birthday Iâm so excited Do you have any petsâ   If you donât already know the girl you like introduce yourself as soon as you sit down Tell her your name and maybe what you think of the class Just a few sentences âIâm Steven I usually sit over by the Coke machine at lunch but I thought Iâd switch it up todayâ   When delivered with the right intentions a sincere compliment can make anyone feel good Avoid saying things about her body or comments that are lewd or sexual Instead tell her you like her shirt or her earrings Even better compliment her ideas while you guys are talkingBe honest An insincere compliment is usually easy to pick out and can have the opposite effectâI really like listening to you break down the thematic elements of the latest episode of Supernatural Itâs opening up the show in a new way for meâ âThose are really nice earrings Where did you get themâ Avoid sexually charged compliments Donât just monopolize the conversation Sitting next to some you like is a great way to get to know them better Ask her about herself What kinds of things is she into How is she liking the class so far What does she usually like to get for lunch from the cafeteriaIf this is a first meeting keep the questions light Avoid extremely personal questions Smile and nod your head Say things like âI seeâ âYesâ or âI Understandâ Make eye contact This helps you appear confident It also assures her that you are listening when she speaks and that you are engaged in what she has to say If she is avoiding eye contact or leaning away from you these may be indicators that she is not into the conversation You can try redirecting the topic to something more neutral or inline with her interests This may also be a sign that she needs more space or is feeling somehow intruded on Try leaning back or scooting over a bit to give her more room   If you notice her leaning forward smiling andor making eye contact then this is a good indicator that she is engaged in the conversation and having a good time Keep it up

associate the feeling of excitement with you and it may help create a heightened sense of romantic interest in you    Not only are couples who engage in exciting activities significantly happier in their longterm relationships  but being in an excited state of mind also increases sexual arousal in the shortterm as wellGo on some rides together before you are alone together Ski hike dance or to a concertâanything that will get the adrenalin flowing for both of you  Evening often works the best because dim lights and darkness has been found to increase attraction communication and connection physical contact and sexual arousalPlus special or new surroundings are sure to make the kiss more memorable   The location might be outside under the stars in a candlelit restaurant or a dark gym during lunch but make sure the two of you have some privacy She may not want an audience   While you will want to dress in clean clothes brush your hair and look good for your date donât forget to pay special attention to your oral hygiene Brush your teeth and donât eat anything strong or stinky like garlic before and during your date You can also bring along breath mints or gum just in case   Youâll want your lips to be soft so bring along some lip balm or chapstick as well Wear red It makes men seem more attractive and sexually desirable Your goal is to become friends so youâll want to find things to laugh about together and discover things that you have in common Read up on some funny jokes or make up your own and tell her Laughing is a good way to break the anxiety and awkwardness of first dates   Start with small talk about the weather or a teacher you have in common Compliment her on her hair clothes or smile Get to know her personal preferences by discussing movie scenes or songs to get an idea of what kind of things she likes and how she feels about romantic encounters Keep your face tilted up when you talk to her as this makes you seem more masculine and attractive You want her to feel comfortable and connected to youâmore so than her other guy friends Sharing emotional and personal information can really create a very strong and lasting connectionWomen often use kissing to bond and reinforce that bondSome questions or prompts to ask in order to enhance bonding are Describe a perfect day What do you feel most grateful for in your life What is the greatest thing that you have accomplishment in your life What memory do you treasure the most What is your worst memory If your house caught on fire and you only had time to save one item family and pets are already safe what would it be Show her that you like her by smiling and looking into her eyesLet her know how you feel She may not know that you want to be more than friends so the best thing you can do to avoid being stuck in the âfriend zoneâ is to tell her you want more Youâll want to pay special attention to how she reacts to you to decide ifwhen you should go for the kiss Positive body language tells you that she likes what you are doing while negative body language tells you that she dislikes it Look for combinations of either positive or negative behaviors that let you know how she feels   Positive body language can be shown when she moves towards you points her feet toward you uncrosses her legs keeps her arms open and palms up playfully fondles her jewelry or hair smiles or maintains eye contactNegative body language may mean she moves away from you points her feet away from you keeps her legs and arms crossed palms down hands closed fidgets frowns or turns her eyes to the sideIf you are getting a lot of negative body language then you should probably change your approach or try again at a better time or when she is in a better mood If she make a lot of body contact with you such as touching your hand rubbing against your knee gently bumping up against you tapping you on the shoulder or holding your hand then sheâs probably into you To get close enough for a kiss you have to enter her personal space and see how she feels about it It takes trust or expectation to allow you to get closer and if sheâs ok with it you know you have a good chance of getting that kissAdditionally touch reinforces that you are interested in her and that you enjoy making contact with her   Be a gentleman Pull out her chair at a restaurant and push it back in after she sits down This gives you the opportunity to gently touch her on the shoulder arm or upper backHold her hand If she doesnât pull away from you then you know she likes what you are doing Adjust her hair Touching her hair is intimate without being as personal as a kiss and will allow you to see how she feels about you If she flinches or moves away then sheâs probably not ready or interested in a kiss If she seems to like it then you can take the next step toward that first kissTry a kiss on the cheek first Lean in and give her a peck on the cheek to see whether she offers positive or negative feedback Then you can decide when itâs time to try a real mouthtomouth kiss   You will want to build up to the moment and find the right time to break the tension with a kiss Donât wait too long though or she may think you arenât interestedWhen you are both close touching regularly maintaining extended eye contact showing positive body language and you are not being distracted take your chance   The right time for the two of you may be toward the end of the first or second date but itâs better to do it sometime before the end of the night so youâre not sitting in the car or standing in the doorway awkwardlyBe spontaneous An incredible kiss happens when everything falls into place It does not have to be at any specific point during your time together It could happen before you enter a restaurant early in the evening across a dinner table in a theater or just while taking a stroll under a full moonTry not to ask first Asking permission shows a lack of confidence and can ruin the moment Her body language should tell you when sheâs ready but if you really arenât sure you can ask When kissing assertiveness is attractive so commit and go through with itLook at her lips wet your lips for lubrication turn your head slightly to the rightand lean in for a closedmouth kiss Wait for a moment so your partner can meet you halfwayUse touch to make the kiss more interesting such as holding her cheek or head brushing her hair back touching her neck or cuddling Though you may maintain eye contact until she returns the kiss itâs best to close your eyes once your lips touch The initial kiss is best closedmouth without a lot of saliva exchange and keep your tongue in your mouthKiss for a few moments and pull away when she does You can still maintain physical touch and eye contact thoughNowâs the time to follow her lead and match her movements and passionListen to her breathing to see if she is enjoying the kiss and to ensure you are letting her get enough air Sometimes the girl you want to kiss is just not interested and you will have to move on Recognize that itâs probably not your fault she doesnât want to kissâmaybe she has a lot on her mind is already in a committed relationship or just ate garlic for lunch   Donât make over generalizations about the fact that this girl didnât want a kiss Realize that being rejected in this one particular situation with this person does not mean that it will happen again with someone else or that there is anything wrong with you Itâs important to know that what happened does not say anything about your selfworth or value as a personGive yourself some time to âget overâ your feelings for this girl and try again with someone else that you like
If the boyfriend is one of your close friends then yeah its a very good idea to back off unless you want to ruin your friendship But if you dont know who the boyfriend is and want to get a sense of her relationship with him then you can try to slyly get a sense of her relationship and how serious it is without prying too much Heres what you can say   What are you up to this weekend How long have you been with your boyfriend I had a girlfriend but we broke up a few months ago It was hard but I feel much better about it now  Though you cant just come out and ask her if shes happy you can get a sense about it just by talking Basically if she complains to you about her boyfriend all the time then that is a strong sign that her relationship is not looking so good See if you can get an idea of how shes feeling just by making casual comments and seeing if she responds in the negative or affirmative Basically you dont want to try to get with a girl who is in a great or a particularly long relationship you dont want to deal with the emotional baggage even if she does decide to end things   Say It must be nice to live with your partner Whats that like Or say Youve been together for two years Thats a pretty long timeâ   Before you step further see if the girl even cares about you in a romantic way Read the signs Does she go out of her way to talk to you Does she light up when you walk into the room Does she make excuses to always be at your side Does she even flirt a little bit If so then yeah theres a good chance that she may have a crush on you Here are some other ways you can see if this is the case   Talk about other girls in front of her Without being too obvious about it see if she gets jealous Give her a compliment or two See if she gives one back later   If you want to get with the girl then you cant turn into her best friend the guy she can come to with all of her problems Though talking to her about her boyfriend and relationship in the beginning can be a good way to get a sense of whats really going on the last thing you want to do is to be the guy who she comes to with a carton of Cherry Garcia at midnight so she can cry about her communication issues with her boyfriend You want to be seen as another romantic prospect plain and simple not as her new BFF   Though you do want to be seen as a romantic prospect that does not mean you want her to see you as a sharper snazzier version of her current boyfriend She should see you as someone completely new refreshing and exciting not as another guy she can take to the movies and hold hands with If she starts complaining to you about her boyfriend issues say Hey you can save that stuff for your best friend I just really dont want to go there okay   If you want to talk to a girl you like who has a boyfriend in the hopes of breaking up her relationship and having it lead to something more then you should make sure youre talking to a girl who is worth it a girl who is really interested in you and not just with flirting with you and then coming home to her boyfriend Here are some girls to avoid   The girl who lets you take her out to dinner and the movies only to go home to her boyfriend Dont take her out like youre her boyfriend unless you actually are her boyfriend She may just be using you for free food and drinks The girl who flirts with you for months but doesnt let it go anywhere Dont be with the perpetual flirt who just likes to get attention from guys and nothing more The girl with the crazy boyfriend You do not want to get mixed up in that The girl who is just looking for a guypal See above about avoiding the Friend Zone at all costs The girl who is just using you to make her boyfriend jealous Stay as far away as possible   If you want the girl to like you then you have to be respectful of her and of the fact that she has a boyfriend Dont make jokes about the boyfriend be sleazy always try to put your arm around her or say demeaning things about the boyfriend or her relationship If you really want her to like you then you have to treat her like a lady You can compliment her but dont make it look like you are perfectly OK hitting on a girl who has a boyfriend let her start to see that theres something special about you   Even if she is entertaining the idea of being with you nothing will put it out of her mind faster than if you blatantly try to hook up with her   Get her to the point where she really likes you and wants to spend more time together Mention a movie you want to see and see if she asks to come along Tell her about a party youre throwing and see if shed like to be there The ball should be in her court so she can make these decisions on her own and not feel like youre putting too much pressure on her Play a little bit hard to get you have a lot going on and plenty of girls who want you and if shes interested she should get in line   Letting her realize how awesome you are just by being your charming self is better than degrading yourself by begging her to hang out with you when you know she is taken   Whether youre studying together going to the same party or just randomly ending up at a cafe after class make sure you spend some time with her Dont just flirt over text or send her Facebook messages if you actually want to get somewhere If you think it would be too weird to hang out alone hang out with her in a group setting first But try to get her alone when you can so she can start thinking about you in a romantic way and really noticing the fact that you two have a lot of chemistry   Let her see that you see something unique in her and that youre not just trying to get together with her because you think shes hot Compliment her hair an aspect of her personality or her ability to work so hard in school You shouldnt hit on her touch her or be too obvious about it but you should let her know that you really see something in her If she has a feeling that you really have a sense of the amazing person she is then she will start to see that you may be the right guy for her   Show her that you really care about what she thinks Ask her what she thinks about your new shoes your chemistry teacher or a new band you like Let her see that you really value her thoughts         You dont need to spell it out for her but you should let her see that you view her as more than a friend You can do this through compliments suggestions that you really care about her or just by making eye contact and standing close to her when you talk Here are some things you can say   I think your new haircut really makes your eyes stand out It looked great before but its even prettier now Youre one of the only girls Ive met who loves sports and who is really fun to talk to about almost anything Thats so cool I really feel like I can talk to you about anything   You shouldnt have to fake it to impress the girl and make her see that youre a guy worth knowing Stay modest while letting her see that you have potential that youre smart cool talented and interesting and someone who would be perfect for her Just be your best self without feeling like youre being dishonest   Open up to her about the things that matter to you Just make sure that shes also opening up After you tell her something that might be a bit private you can say I havent talked to anyone about that in a long time Its just so easy to talk to you for some reason   Remember what we said about how the last thing she wants is another guy who is exactly like her boyfriend Well its absolutely true Be spontaneous Be fun Dont call or text her every five minutes just to check in Come up with something completely random and fun that you can do together Give her an original compliment or a funny little gift Ask her to dance in the middle of the street Just do whatever a normal boring old boyfriend wouldnt do Make her feel alive every time the two of you are together   Dont be afraid to talk to her about something that you think may be a little random if its funny or interesting You dont have to fit any kind of mold   This is a delicate balance to find You want her to know that you want her without coming on too strong or always being up in her grill Talk to her at parties walk alongside her after class but do not become the guy that she can flirt and have some fun with before she comes home to her boyfriend Be around let her know youre interested but also let her see that you wont wait around forever for her to make the call   If you just flirt around with her for months shell think its perfectly okay for her to have a guy to flirt with and a guy she is dating Well thats not cool and the longer you go for this the more shell see that she can string you along without ever making a move So its time to make a move have her respond or get her to make a move already whether it means kissing you and getting with her boyfriend Ideally of course shell break up with her boyfriend and then get with you   Seriously the sooner this can happen the better If youve been flirting around for over a month chances are shell never make the break   So youve snagged the girl shes dumped her loser boyfriend and now youve finally gotten what you want Does this mean you should go shopping for engagement rings or take a weekend trip to the Bahamas Absolutely not Even if the girl got out of a bad relationship its likely that shes still reeling so give her some time and space If you try to hang out with her every second of every day shes likely to feel overwhelmed and to back away Instead give her space and hang out with her once or twice a week or however many times shes ready for   This is something people dont get breakups are always painful even if youre the person who did the breaking up You may think that she feels totally free and happy because she got rid of the dead weight in her life but shell still be dealing with pain and the inevitable grief that comes from saying goodbye to something even if it wasnt all that great and you have to be understanding of that       Though she shouldnt be the one to call or text you every time make sure to give her some of the power If youre the one who initiates contact every time she may think that shes not ready for another boyfriend or for anything serious         Whether she got out of a three month relationship with a real jerk or a fiveyear relationship with a nice but boring guy you should never bring up the guy especially if you want to make fun of him call him a loser remind her that he wasnt good enough for her etc Though your intentions may be pure and you may just want to make her feel better about ending something that wasnt working she may take this as an assault on her former relationship and may be offended because its likely that she still has tender feelings for her ex   Give it time If she was in a five year relationship then yeah she may not be ready to talk about that part of her life for a long time Maybe even a year will pass before she brings up her ex at all because it will hurt too much to do it before hand Be patient If you keep asking questions about her ex youll come off as jealous and shell get annoyed Yeah there may be this whole part of her life that you dont have access to for a while because it has to do with her ex Nobody said snagging a girl with a boyfriend was easy or that it didnt have consequences But if you wait out this painful period itll be worth it   Okay so you grabbed a girl with a boyfriend and only now does it dawn on you  if she was able to cheat or just emotionally cheat on her boyfriend with another guy then what will keep her from being unfaithful to you with the next guy who comes along Well hopefully she got out of her last relationship because it was truly bad and because she saw something special in you not because she was generally restless If she has a pattern of this behavior then that is something to worry about but if not unfortunately the heart does wander sometimes if its worth it   Your job is to focus on your new relationship instead of worrying that shes seeing someone on the side if youre constantly jealous and paranoid because of the way that you met then your newfound love will never wok If she just got out of something serious the last thing she may want is to feel like shes smothered all over again and cant go more than ten minutes without checking in with you   So the two of you are together maybe even officially dating Sure you might have met in a somewhat sketchy way but that doesnt mean you have to bring it up all the time Focus on whats ahead of you instead of looking behind and work on building a solid foundation for your love not one thats based on lies deceit and uncertainty Even if you had a rocky beginning you may be able to form a strong bond though yeah itll be tougher than if you were just two single people who met at bar If you do want it to work focus on the things you will do together instead of any of the pain that is behind you   This doesnt mean you can never talk about the period when you were getting together on the dl But it does mean that you should focus on all of the great things ahead of you not on the pain that you might have felt in the beginning Find new things that neither of you have done that you have always wanted to try whether its making your own sushi or going on a long hike Find things you can claim as yours and that you can use to build a solid foundation for your love Then just sit back relax and enjoy the ride

Whenever you have to talk to your crush keep your voice controlled and your tone normal Being nervous causes a lot of people to speed up their speech so focus on talking slowly and evenly Keep your voice light and speak to them directly   If you need to practice speaking calmly before you have to be around your crush Work on a calm tone of voice   Being anxious when youre talking to someone can sometimes make you feel like your mind has gone blank Awkward silence might set in which will definitely make your crush wonder whats going on When you know youll have to talk to your crush prepare a few topics ahead of time Have a few questions ready to ask your crush as well in case the conversation gets stalled   You could talk about things like shared classes a new movie music extracurricular activities or an upcoming school event Prepare questions like So have you started your paper for history class yet and Did you write down the homework from 3rd period   Smiling is an easy way to make you appear calmer and more confident to other people If your crush is a friend that you have to be around fairly often strive to act as normal as possible when youre together Stick to your usual topics of conversation and your typical activities   Try to avoid nervous twitching and fiddling with things unnecessarily Stand up straight and keep your body language positive
Do not hesitate to text him too much If a guy is interested in you he wont worry about you being overly enthusiastic or overeager Text him what you really want to say to him without trying to tone down your feelings or emotionsFor example say a guy texts you that he got a new after school job You feel inclined to say Thats so great Im super happy for you You may feel the inclination to pause and try to tone your language down Instead you may feel its better to say Cool Avoid filtering yourself If a guy likes you back he will be happy that youre happy for him   Many people worry about rules regarding who should text and when Try not to put so much stake in this If youre being standoffish a guy may not realize you have feelings for him If you think of something to say to him send him a text without hesitating Telling a guy about your day to day life is a great way to show him you have feelings for himText him about what youre doing and when youre thinking of him For example say hes a huge sports fan You can text him something like The football game is playing on the radio Made me think of you Text him things about your life you think may interest him and ask him about what hes doing For example Im so excited to go to my friends place tonight What are you doing Any exciting plans Do not wait around for him to text you first if you think of something to say Just do it Making regular conversation with someone without prompting can help show them you like him   If you like a guy give me a little extra attention on social media Like his posts frequently Comment on things like pictures Retweet his tweets This will show him you care   If youre feeling bold try posting something flirty on his social media If he uploads a new profile picture for example comment something like Cut picÂ    Public social media interactions can certainly be flirtatious If you like or comment on a guys posts a lot he may get the sense you like him However a private message can give an extra sense of intimacy Try chatting with him in private via social media This shows an extra amount of interestIf hes on an app like Facebook messenger try talking to him there Send him a generic message like Hey whats up to begin a private conversation via social media Share things with him via social media For example send him funny links or links to articles that may interest him Send this material with a flirty message like Thought of youÂ

The best way to be more comfortable and better at kissing is to practice first It seems like obvious advice but it really does help You can practice on your hand with another object or with another person   Keep in mind you might not want to kiss another person because if you are already attached to girl you want to kiss or kiss her really soon after and she finds out she might be upset  The girl doesnt want to taste garlic or other icky flavors after the kiss as this can be a major turn off Before the date or when you see her brush your teeth and tongue and use mouth wash To maintain good breath try drinking water on the date instead of soft drinks You can also suck on a mint or chew minty gum for a few minutes midway through the date   If you are at a restaurant bring along your favorite breath freshener Excuse yourself after dinner and go to the bathroom Freshen your breath and then to make sure your breath smells good hold your hand up to your face breathe and smell   This can help set the mood Tell her that what she is wearing looks pretty she will appreciate it If she playfully punches you a lot or teases you in a friendly manner then she wants you to touch her Stay in safe territory like quickly grabbing her hand when you want to go show her something she will appreciate not having to do the whole awkward looking at each other and blushing thing   If you are brave you could put your arm around her waist when you two are laughing and say something playful like Youre so cute Offer to give her a piggyback ride or tickle her a little if she likes it Dont do this constantly and when you do it do it respectfully Dont grab her breasts or butt Flirting will make her more open to kissing you Think of kissing as reaching the top of a mountain You have to hike a little to get to the top   Getting good timing will make it a lot easier A good time for a kiss is at the end of a date when youre generally saying goodbye when youre out for a walk or after youve just finished watching a movie Youll notice that all of these times are pretty private and should pretty much just be the two of you This is important You should choose a private time for a first kiss   The kiss should stay private too Dont kiss and tell This is rude   It seems weird because were only used to seeing the super charming people in movies kissing but asking a girl if you can kiss her is a great way to show her that you respect her and care about her feelings Shell appreciate it   You can say something like I really want to kiss you right now Is that okay or Do you want me to kiss you now   This is a universal signal that youre moving in for a kiss This gives her the option to let you know that shes uncomfortable and will help keep you from getting slapped Dont close your eyes until you are just about to kiss her   Dont use tongue the first time you kiss a girl Make sure you close your eyes right before you start the kiss   Move in sideways a little If your head is just as upright as her youll bump your nose into her nose instead of your lips into her lips   If shes a deep passionate kisser shell hold your lips in hers for a long while you wont need to move your lips much   If you want cup her face with your hand and slowly stroke her cheek with your thumb Make sure you still have one arm firm around her waist or lower back   Kissing is like a silent conversation You want to be kind gentle forgiving and you want the other person to keep coming back for more   Youd be surprised how many people forget to breathe when they arent used to kissing If you want to keep kissing her but youre having trouble finding a break to breathe try moving away from kissing her mouth to kiss her cheek or forehead   Slowly pull away after a few seconds or minutes and open your eyes Congratulations Each kiss after the first one is so much easier Youve reached the top of the mountain   This is the next big skill for kissers to learn Its not as hard as it seems and with practice it can be a killer addition to you kissing arsenal   Making out seems tough at first especially if you both have trouble finding your rhythm but it will get way easier with time Just make sure to not overdo it and always keep things interesting   Once youve got those basic techniques in your repertoire youll want to get really good at kissing and that mostly comes down to being passionate This is easy to do if you let yourself relax and let your feelings come out   Chances are the longer youre with your girl the more likely it will be that you might find yourselves kissing around other people such as on a double or very public date This is okay but you want to be sure to do so politely   If this is your first kiss then theres a good chance you also have braces Dont worry Despite all the jokes in movies and TV shows its not all that tough to kiss with braces
Even if itâs scary this will answer a lot of your questions Stop snooping around trying to guess her every intention Everyone will respect you if you go up and ask her on a date They will admire your bravery and wish that they had the guts to do something like that   Even if itâs just a girl who works at the bookstore go up to her and see if she wants to get lunch with you sometime The worst that happens is that they say no and they will probably be really flattered If they say anything mean then they werenât worth your time to begin with For example just ask her what shes doing for lunch tomorrow Ask her if she would be up to grab some tacos with you Its as easy as that It might be a good idea to find out if she has a boyfriend If she does she probably is more interested in him than you If she has a boyfriend the best thing to do is lay off of her If she doesnt have one she could be interested in anyone   This is another way of being direct and finding out the answer to your question However the benefit of this method is that you donât have to follow through on a date and neither do they If youâre on the younger side a date is a difficult thing to accomplish just asking if they like you is a good way to start You can build from there after your question has been answered   You dont have to say do you like me Try telling her that you feel like you guys have a really good connection and you find yourself wondering if it might be something more than friendship Then ask what she thinks   This isnât the bravest way to go about it but it might work Try to choose one of her friends who you are close to also If the friend knows you are a good person they might be willing to help you out and tell you the truth It might be hard to hear but at least you wonât be constantly worrying about if she likes you or not If they refuse to answer then thatâs probably a good sign However the friend also might just say that they donât know

Act the same way you do when your around your friends dont act differently around them than the way you act around your crush If you do he or she will think youre being a fake  Realize that you cannot make a person like you You can be persuasive and encourage a person by being charming friendly and happy in their presence but you cannot force their interest to focus solely on you As such its important to be realistic and accept that he or she may want to be just friends or wont even want that However that doesnt mean that you dont try It means that you learn to read the signs and respect the decision they make as hard as it may be if it doesnt go in your favor   Dress nicely and neatly Show your flair by wearing things that represent your style   Stay comfortable There is no point looking good if youre suffering Jeans that are so skinny you can barely walk will elicit giggles in sports class not aweinspiring looks   Do you both like the same things Perhaps you play the same sport or do the same activity during lunch hour or after school Make the most of things you both connect on   Has your crush been having some troubles in a subject youre just ace at Hop in and offer some advice and some tutoring help What a great way to get closer   Show him or her your generous side by offering things when in need such as a forgotten pencil or lunch or a listen to your newly downloaded hit song   Talk about stuff that he or she wants to talk about Talk about stuff that you would like to talk about Ask your crush some fun questions such as when is your birthday What is your favorite color Little by little youll get to know her or him   There is no need to be rude or to show bad manners   Act the same but with a little bit of flirting and feeling this time When he or she makes a joke laugh genuinely When you see her or him in the hallway make eye contact and perhaps offer a wink When you both are staring at each other dont worry if either of you blushes a littleââthat just shows you that youre both attracted to each other   Dont offer too many compliments just enough to make it clear that you dont mind noticing the good things about her or him   Whenever you are sitting by him or her angle your toes where he or she is sitting then bump against your crush gently Gently brush away a hair from his or her shoulder or even face Gently hold her or his arm briefly Be a little touchyfeely without overdoing it   Invite her or him to your house for a party or ask him or her to dance with you at a class party Keep your friends around and your crushs friends around at first to keep it light   When you have the impression that he or she is interested in you ask him or her for a date That is if he or she hasnt already asked you
Many people meet someone and jump straight into a relationship because they prefer not to be single While this does fill one of your needs you have no way of knowing of that person will make you happy in the long run The first thing that you should do is reflect on what you want out of a relationship and out of a partner and what attracts you to someone else Think about things likeDo I want to be with someone who is career or family oriented What physical features do I find attractive in a person What about a personâs personality attracts me Do I want to be with someone who is spontaneous or predictable Think about your list but remember that no one can ultimately make you happy but yourself Think about the traits that would compliment what you want in a happy life rather than depending upon someone else to bring fulfillment to you  The best way to meet people that have things in common with you is to go out and do the things you love doing Inevitably you will meet someone that enjoys doing the same things This is a great start to a potential relationship as you will naturally attract people when you are doing something you enjoyFor example if you are an avid book reader you might join a book club for people around your age There are many organizations and groups from book clubs to adventure clubs that can help you spark a relationship with someone who enjoys similar things   The friends you already have are likely to have common interests and know other people with interests like your own Sometimes a friendship can transition into a relationship easily if thereâs an attraction between the two people Friends can also introduce you to someone that they know and think youâd like   Do not try to force a relationship with a friend This can lead to a failed relationship and a failed friendship   Though the internet makes it easy for people to create a false representation of themselves there are people out there who are looking for genuine relationships You can explore dating sites and social media to meet people and get to know them Just be careful when going out with a person you meet on the internet You should always meet in a safe public place
Talking to a girl you like can be a scary experience and requires a lot of bravery and belief in yourself Before you go and talk to her create a list of your best attributes Once you read over your list youll discover that you have a lot to be confident about If you stand up straight youâll automatically feel more confident Keep your arms uncrossed to signal with your body language that you are open and friendly Remember to try and look your best Put on an outfit that you feel comfortable in and makes you look good  If youâre very nervous about talking to the girl you like practice what you want to say in front of the mirror Be careful not to practice too much or you may sound robotic when speaking to her in real life   Look for the perfect opportunity to run into the girl you like If you go to the same school you could hang out where you know she has lunch or if you work at the same job you could take your break at the same time she does   Be sure to pick a place that is casual and comfortable for both of you For example you wouldnât want to run into her outside of her house if youâve never been there as that may seem creepy and scare her Pick a time to run into her when itâs a good time to talk For example if she is running late to an after school activity waiting for her after class lets out would not be a good idea as she would be rushing to leave Try to find a time when she wont be surrounded by a big group of friends It can be hard to approach a girl if she is with a big group of people   The easiest opening line is a genuine compliment Your compliment should show that you pay attention and should be specific to the girl you like A good compliment can easily lead into a conversationFor example if the girl you like scored a goal at her last soccer game you could say âCongratulations on that goal Youâre an awesome soccer player How long have you been playing forâ This compliment shows that you noticed her soccer skills paid attention to the last game and are interested in learning more about her Avoid generic compliments like âYouâre prettyâ or âYouâre niceâ as these can sound insincere and impersonal   A great way to start a conversation is to ask her for help on something she has expertise in People like to feel useful and share their knowledge   For example if you run into the girl you like at the library you could ask her for a book recommendation If you both enjoy reading this could lead to a great conversation on the latest things youâve read or your favorite books   Do a little detective work and discover some things your crush likes or dislikes You may find you have some interests in common or at least something to talk aboutTo help figure out her interests you can talk to some mutual friends to learn more about her You can also check out her social media pages to see what sorts of things she likes to do Most people love to talk about the things that they are interested in Once you find out one of her interests you can ask her about it to learn more For example if you know she is interested in basketball you can ask her how long she has been playing This can also lead into the two of you going to play basketball together   In order to spend more time with the girl you like it is helpful to join something she is part of like an after school club a team or a volunteer organizationFor example if the girl you like volunteers at a retirement home on the weekends you could also sign up to volunteer at the retirement home If she is part of the debate club at school and youâre interested in debate you could join that club and spend more time with her there   It may be tempting to hide behind a screen but you need to spend time with the girl you like in real life Your relationship will develop when you have connections in the real world and not only over the phone or computer   Donât ever try to be someone youâre not You want the girl you like to like you not a persona youâve inventedFor example if she is part of the school band but you donât play an instrument you shouldnât join the band just to spend time with her You could attend the bandâs concerts to support her while finding another activity or interest you have in common Remember to keep up your own interests as well If youre spending time doing an activity that she likes still make time to do activites that you like Girls like when you have your own interests and hobbies   Good communication is the key to any relationship romantic or not You should try and communicate everyday whether in person over the phone or through social mediaRemember not to overdo it with your communication If the girl you like is pulling back or cutting your conversations short take a break from communicating She may be busy or simply uninterested   Make sure you are listening attentively when she talks Keep comfortable eye contact and nod while she speaks so she knows youâre listening Follow up with relevant questions to really show that youâre paying attention and care about what she has to say   If she is sharing something with you try to commit it to memory This shows her that you care about what she is saying and that youre interested in her   For example if she says âMy brother Carson really loves basketball He has a game this weekendâ you should remember her brotherâs name That way after the weekend you can say something like âHey How was your weekend How did Carson do at his gameâ   Girls love when people make them laugh Embrace your natural sense of humor and ensure you are both having a good time whenever you hang outYou donât have to be a standup comedian to make the girl you like laugh You can share a funny story youâve heard or a silly pun one of your friends came up with If youâre shy or donât think youâre funny donât force yourself to tell jokes Focus on making the girl you like smile while you learn what sort of things make her laugh For example you could watch a comedy special together or go to an improv show and laugh together   Drop small hints like compliments or hanging out one on one that show this girl you like her as more than just a friend   For example if you notice she is wearing a new sweater you could say âWow that sweater looks great on you You look really beautiful todayâ This type of compliment is sincere shows you notice small details and sounds romantic which may help her to see you in a romantic way You could also ask her to hang out one on one For example you could suggest a study date by saying âDo you want to go to a cafe and study for our Spanish test tonight Just the two of us Iâll treat you to a cup of hot chocolateâ A great hint that you like her is giving her a gift You want to make sure the gift is a small and thoughtful token and not something expensive and impersonal The gift should be something you bought because it made you think of her and shows that you care   If the girl you like is interested in you as well she may begin to drop some hints that she wants to be more than friends Look for moments when she is acting flirty touching you or making plans to spend alone time with you   She may also be dropping hints that she is not interested If she invites other people to hang out with you or talks about other people she has feelings for she may not be interested in anything more than friendship with you Everyone has a slightly different way of showing that theyâre interested Just because she is showing lots of signs that she likes you doesnât mean that she does for sure And if she isnât showing any signs it doesnât mean sheâs not interested   Itâs important to be honest with the girl that you like as youâre building up your friendship Be direct and tell her how you feel If you think she might be feeling the same way you could follow up by asking her on a dateFor example you could say âIâve enjoyed all this time weâve been spending together lately and I really like you Would you want to go out with meâ Make it obvious that you are inviting her on a romantic date because you have feelings for her and not just a hang out as friends Give the girl you like time to answer Whatever her answer be respectful of her decision and accept how she feels
Tie the pony or horse to a post rail or crossties before beginning your stirrup adjustments Never leave your horse or pony untied while moving the stirrups up or down   Alternatively can have someone else hold the horse in place while you adjust the stirrups  Before measuring for your stirrup length you need to be sure that the horses saddle is on correctly If it is not the measurements you do will not be correct Look both parallel to the horse and perpendicular making sure that the saddle is square and that the stirrups are both the same length   If the saddle is not square adjust the saddle on top of the horse before you start adjusting the stirrups   Find a starting position for the stirrup in which it is about as long as your arm This will allow you to hold it out and do more exact measuring Pull the stirrup iron straight out until it sits just under your armpit and the leather runs the full length of your arm If the end of the stirrup iron doesnt reach your armpit when your fingers reach the saddle then the stirrup is too short If it droops between your armpit and your fingers then it is too longWhile measuring stand perpendicular to the horse and the stirrups If you have just begun riding have shorter rather than longer stirrups so that you will have more control   Once you know the correct length you will need to adjust the length by putting the stirrup buckle into the correct hole on the stirrup leather Get hold of the buckle at the top of the stirrup leather and adjust the buckle until the stirrup is the correct lengthMost buckles are tucked up close to the saddle but can be pulled down lower during adjustment This will make adjustment easier   Loosen the stirrup on the other side so that it is about as long as your arm Pull the stirrup iron straight out towards your armpit The length of the stirrup from the connection on the saddle to the bottom of the stirrup iron should be the length of your arm from the armpit to the fingertipsOnce both are adjusted look at them both from the front of the horse They should be the same length   The length of stirrups you want may also differ slightly depending on what type of riding you are going to do For example If you are jumping or roping you need a short stirrup length to sit higher in the saddleIf you are doing dressage cutting or saddle seat riding your stirrup length should be slightly longer because the rider is sitting back in the saddle and using a lot of leg to control the horse   In order to really accurately measure your stirrup length you may want to have a helper Having someone else to help you will allow you to get in the saddle and assess where the right length should beThis person can also help hold the horse still while you are making adjustments and they can help you get up into the saddle if you need help If you are a beginner have a teacher or a more experienced rider help you choose the right saddle and stirrup length They should belong to the same discipline of riding as you do   Once you get up into the saddle make sure your ears shoulders hips and heels are all in straight alignment Making sure that you are in alignment will help to assure that you get the right stirrup measurementPut your feet into the stirrups while you are assessing your alignment This help you get a general feeling for whether they the right length or not   Take your feet out of the stirrups Have your friend make sure that the bottom of the stirrup is level with your ankle bone when your feet are out of the stirrupsThis may be hard to see because of riding boots so the friend may need to feel with their fingers to know where your ankle bone lies If you are doing a type of riding that requires shorter or longer stirrups take that into consideration here For example if you want shorter stirrups because you are going to do some jumping make sure that the stirrups hit your leg above the ankle bone If you want longer stirrups for dressage or cutting the stirrup should line up below the ankle bone   With your feet in the stirrups once again you should assess whether the ball of your foot is resting on the iron If it is your heels should be pointing directly downward and your toes pointing forwardOnce again your helper may be in the best position to judge whether this is the case If you dont have a helper you can stand up in the stirrups and judge the amount of space you have between the saddle and your seat There should be a space about the size of a fist but this is a relatively inexact measurement   Take a ride around your corral or ring and ask your friend to check your alignment Have them look at the angle of your leg when they are perpendicular to you Also the angle of the upper leg should equal the angle of the horses shoulderThere should be an equal angle between the thigh and the knee and the knee and the lower leg If not the stirrup is usually too long creating a straighter angle in the lower leg
When you approach him does your face all of a sudden turn red Does your body shake Does your heart skip a beat Does your body all of a sudden feel sick or cold or warm You could ask your friends to give you a little update on that each time whether youre near him close to him or around him  You dont want that to happen because youre not ready for a move yet And youre not ready because youre reading this article and because you dont know what to do when youre around him   You should even look at something else that will get your attention off that boy Like say you had homework Think about it and see if you did it right Or if youre at a store you can just look through the aisles and think of what you want to buy And if youre with friends dont look in his direction just try to keep cool talk and pay real close attention to what your friends are saying Try to act as if he isnt even there Slowly youll start to get over your shyness   Do it slowly because it will not happen right away It will probably take about 3 days or more and maybe possibly even a week But it will help you A LOT   Look good but be yourself and dont change yourself or who you are it will make you feel better about yourself Your crush may notice you if you are very positive confident smart and outgoing around him   For example when youre with them ask them Do I look pretty and of course they will tell you the honest and real answerYesnot a fake answer   If its music ask him about new concerts or CDs   Try to act like you do around your friends or family members

You can run a Google search on different zoos and aquariums  not necessarily in your city but anywhere in the world  to see which have a clean record and treat their animals with care and respect as much as a zoo or aquarium environment allows If you feel that the dolphins at a zoo or aquarium are not being cared for properly look for other options or adopt from a recognized wildlife organization instead   If you live near a zoo or aquarium that offers dolphin adoption you can also ask employees at the zoo or aquarium whether  the dolphins are healthy the water condition is good the dolphins are being fed well the tanks are large enough to keep the dolphins happy and active     Many zoos and aquariums offer adoption of their animals as a way to offset the costs of food and veterinary billsSome packages may include an adoption certificate photo andor a plush toyPrices for these packages range widely and are generally taxdeductible   Animals at zoos or aquariums might have more than one adoptive parent due to the popularity of the species You can do this by visiting the zoo in person or by looking at the establishments website Usually youll be asked to choose the dolphin you like the most out of several select a package and then make a payment   If you adopt a dolphin from a local zoo or aquarium you have the bonus of being able to visit them in person whenever you want to check up on them Seeing the subject of your donation up close can be rewarding people tend to respond more to charitable causes that have one clearly identifiable recipientYou can also introduce family and friends to your sponsored dolphin this way   There is ample research to suggest that being in captivity is detrimental for dolphins and other cetaceans Dolphins are highly intelligent emotional creatures who live in complex societies in the wild and travel and move regularlyin theory no tank is big enough to accommodate dolphins who swim up to 100 miles a day in the wildKeep in mind that when adopting a dolphin from a zoo or aquarium you may be inadvertently supporting animal captivity Be comfortable with what your donation will be used for be it research education or maintenance and dont forget to check that the zoo or aquarium youre adopting from is legitimate wellestablished and treats its animals with as much dignity as possible
But it will take time for her to realize if she really likes you If you get put into the friend zone it might not be your fault Maybe shes just not ready for something serious yet Or she may have a boyfriend  Ring If you ring her more than you text her it may be good for is your confidence because she will likely take it as your friend   Especially if you want to get into a relationship with her and get out of the friend zone   No matter how much you want to this will just push you further into the friend zone   No matter how much you want to she will take notice of the ones you do give and she will more likely to return the compliments to you   The nice guy approach is good sometimes but with some girls the nice guy gets nowhere All girls are different and the bad boy doesnt always work out all the time either   This is hard if you and her are close friends   agree in a couple of things this is good if you agree with her all the time it means that shes winning not you   Be honest about your feelings see what she thinks and hopefully someday you two will be in a relationship Although dont worry yet this is a hard task that may take some time   Get a plan and make her yours   There are plenty of fish in the sea have confidence And most of all enjoy life dont let her hold you back
Letting himher have a basic knowledge of you will heighten the chances that heshe will say yes when you ask himher If your crush barely knows you at all heshe will be less likely to agree and heshe might get a little scared   If heshe declines try one of the methods again on a different person
Although you may want his attention its important to give him his space If he feels that you respect him and his personal space he may be more likely to interact with you Otherwise he may view you as a needy person and stay away from you For instance if he doesnt respond to your text within five minutes understand that he has his own life   If you notice that he replies to you with very few words dont become upset or demand that he says more Instead it may be helpful to ask questions in your texts so that he has something to respond to Rather than sending him yesorno questions try to come up with ones that may require him to reply with more words ex What did you think of the soccer game If he still gives you a short reply you could wait for a short time to indicate that you want him to say a bit more  Although you should avoid being overly talkative initiate conversations with him to show that youre interested in his life Come up with interesting subjects that engage the both of you Be sure that you give him a chance to express his opinion Dont hesitate to ask questions about himself as most people enjoy talking about themselves If you dont have time to talk to him a simple greeting is enough to grab his attention   If you have trouble selecting conversation topics think of events that are occurring around you For instance if you recently had a biology test talk to him about it and ask whether he did well or not However try to branch out and talk about other subjects rather than only focusing on school If you notice that he isnt talking much consider the possibilities Are you dominating the conversation and not allowing him a chance to speak Is he not interested in the subject Or is he just naturally quiet Do your best to remedy the situation so that he enjoys talking to you   Although you shouldnt stay in the spotlight for too long its a good idea to share some facts about your life with him so that he can get to know you more Tell him things about you  such as your hobbies  that will stick in his mind and show that youre a unique girl You may even discover common interests which may open the way for more conversations   Although you shouldnt overdo it treat him nicely For instance if he doesnt have a lunch offer to give him some money or share your food with him If he tells you about something bad that happened to him sympathize with him and listen to what he has to say Show that you care about him and his wellbeing   Be careful when treating him nicely If he isnt a good person he may take advantage of your kindness If you notice that he is using you immediately stop and dont allow him to manipulate you Although you may be attracted to him it can be dangerous and painful if you let him control you   Although you may want to impress him changing who you are isnt the right choice Youre not only presenting a false image of yourself but also hurting yourself and perhaps even others in the process By staying true to who you are youre showing that you are proud of yourself which may attract his attention Dont pretend to be someone you arent   Avoid changing for him It may be tempting to mold yourself into his type but maintaining that facade will be painful and exhausting Showing how unique you are will attract the right kinds of guys   While it may be easy to worship him allowing your crush to take over your life is a dangerous route It can be easy to overlook his flaws and focus only on his strengths which can be harmful If you feel that you are becoming too obsessed with him you may want to take a step back and place some space between the two of you Participate in different activities to get your mind off of him
This can be done in a number of ways but the best and probably most effective would be ask her if she would like to see your room Something along the lines of Hey want to go upstairs My room is warmernicermore comfortable than here If she seems against it dont push it or youll make her uncomfortable and you should avoid making someone uncomfortable You could also try using some different linesTry saying âAll my CDs are upstairs want to give them a listenâ You could also say âThere are some hilarious pictures in my yearbook upstairs Want to take a lookâ Suggest you go to your room by saying âMy sister always bothers me down here Want to go upstairs where its a little quieterâ Always follow your parentsâ rules about having people in your room and closing doors  She may not be happy with being shut in a room with her boyfriend she hasnt even kissed yet Close the door but not all the way Leave it cracked open slightly It probably wouldnât be ideal if either of your parents come in while you guys are kissing so keep an eye or an ear out for them If you are not allowed to close your door with a girl in the room respect your parentsâ rules and leave the door open If you sit down and pull her down next to you she might feel threatened or feel that things are moving too fast Give her some time to look around your room familiarize herself with it and become more comfortable She will sit down when she is ready and feels like doing so When she does sit down next to her When you are both on the bed show her something like a yearbook your favorite books or music or a funny video on your computer If youre both looking at something or talking while you sit down youll make the atmosphere a lot less awkward and soon both of you will be more comfortable   Say something like âDid you see that YouTube video about the foxâ and then pull up the video on your computer You could also show her a book you like and say âHave you ever read this book Itâs one of my favoritesâ   Making eye contact will help you both feel chemistry and will also help you to understand what she might be thinking or feeling Look for positive signals from her Positive signals include smiling laughing at your jokes or looking at your lipsIf shes playing with her hair or putting her hair behind her ear she may be trying to get you to look at her face Fidgeting with her clothes might mean shes nervous   If she says stop then stop If she stops you it could be for a couple of reasons Either shes not comfortable due to being in an unfamiliar place or sheâs never kissed someone before and is not ready Some people can get nervous others want to save their first kiss for a really special time or place Dont take this personally Try again some other timeIt is possible that she may not like you in that way This can be difficult to accept but donât take it personally Sometimes girls just need a little more time Who knows She might actually want to kiss you later on   Make sure you are gentle and move slowly closing your eyes as you go in for the kiss Move in at a slight angle If you move in with your face upright youll bump noses with her and your lips wont meet This can be awkward   Dont stick out your lips but gently press them against hers Dont try tongue on the first kiss Tongue is not good on the first kiss unless she slips you a little tongue If she does go easy Dont force it down her throat Keep your eyes closed while kissing Otherwise its kind of creepy if youre just staring at her while you kiss Keep it short The first time you kiss keep it under ten seconds If you both end up liking the kiss you can always continue kissing for longer   If you feel its the right time you can move on to the French kiss Do this only if the girl is ready If this is your first kiss altogether not just the first in your room you may want to hold off on trying that If you decide to French kiss move in at an angle close your eyes and begin with a couple closemouth kisses Kiss her lower or upper lip a couple times   When you open your mouth to kiss her slip a little tongue into her mouth and bring it back out The goal is to touch her tongue and touch it gently Dont ram it in there Take turns meeting her tongue with openmouth kisses While French kissing its okay to keep your mouth slightly open Remember to breathe while kissing Its easy to forget to breathe while kissing Breathe through your nose quietly and slowly   When the kiss is over it could be cute to give her a small kiss on the cheek or a hug to end the kiss sweetly This however would not be so cute if the kiss ended in her pushing you away Keep this in mind when making a move and be respectful of the girl If she doesnt want to kiss gently put both your hands on her waist or softly place your hand on one side of her face If she responds well to this keep going If she starts to lean away open her eyes or closes her mouth then stop what you are doing and move on to a different activity
Unfortunately her social media will probably involve lots of pictures and posts of her with someone else Stop following her Twitter Instagram and Tumblr accounts You donât have to unfriend her on Facebook â she will probably notice this and it could make your friendship awkward Instead use Facebookâs privacy settings to block her updates from showing up in your feed   Having to deal with her presence constantly online will make the situation so much harder for you Unfollowing her on social media will help you think about her less and keep you from obsessing over what sheâs doing   This doesnât have to be a permanent thing and you should never feel like a place is âofflimitsâ to you because of another person However youâll probably feel better if you avoid her known hangouts for a short time at least at first   âOut of sight out of mindâ is an old clichÃ that can be very useful when youâre trying to get over a crush Youâll make it harder on yourself to get past the situation if itâs in your face all the time   You might not feel like being around people and it may seem preferable to be alone in your room Make an effort to focus on your school work or find a new hobby that will keep you actively thinking about other things Look for activities that will get you out of the house and around other people   It might take a little extra energy to focus on something other than your crush but you can do it Trying out new hobbies and making plans with your friends can help you keep your mind distracted
Asking your crush to a dance can be nerveracking but knowing you have a good shot of them saying yes will go a long way to boosting your confidence To figure out how interested they are pay close attention to how they act around you For example do they frequently initiate conversation or seek you out in crowds If your crush is consistently going out of their way to speak with you or to be near you itâs likely theyâre attempting to convey their interestsIf they make note of the things that interest you to bring back up later in conversation thatâs also a good sign they may like youIf youâre still unsure try getting your friends to gauge your crushâs interest You donât want them to directly ask himher outright but they can fish for information by bringing you up in conversation and then seeing what your crush says or how they react Keep in mind that if your crush is shy they may be extra awkward and quiet around you so you may have to drop hints to help them open up  Once youâve got a good idea of how your crush feels itâs time to reciprocate You want to let your crush know that youâre interested and open to any potential advances The best way to do this is to talk to them as frequently as you can This may seem a bit awkward especially if youâre constantly nervous around them but there are a bunch of easy conversation starters you can try   For example compliment your crush every now and again when you see them This can be anything from âThat sweater looks really good on youâ to âDid you get a haircut Your hair looks really nice todayâ Just remember not to go over the top or try to force it You can also ask about their interests For example if your crush plays sports or is a big gamer try to ask them questions about their favorite sports teams or an upcoming game release you know theyâre excited about You can also get involved in some of the activities that they enjoy like going to concerts of bands they like Just make sure you are staying true to your own likes you donât want to change yourself just to get your crush interested If you and your crush talk frequently or have at least started to try talking about the dance in general You donât have to say anything about going together but simply talking about the dance will introduce the idea and make it less awkward later when you ask them out It will also let them know youâre interested in going   Try talking about the theme of the dance who is going or what music you think theyâll play For example you could say something like âI heard Jerry and Jess are trying to get a group together to take a trolley to the dance instead of a limo How much do you think thatâll costâ or âDo you think the DJ will take requests I want to dance to Beyonceâ Talking about the dance will also give you a good idea of whether or not your crush plans to go to the dance   This is the simplest method even if it is usually the most stressful To make the situation easier on both you and your crush try to ask them when youâre both alone For example between classes on the bus or at lunch if you get a minute to yourselves Not having a bunch of people or friends around will make you both more comfortable   Make it simple to start say something like âHey could I speak to you a momentâ Then once the two of you are alone ask âI was wondering if youâd like to go to the dance with meâ If youâre nervous try practicing the conversation with a friend beforehand   Whether you and your crush talk frequently or not texting is a great way to communicate without the extra stress of speaking in person You can take your time and revise what you want to say multiple times Try inserting the question into a normal conversation by building up to it For example try talking about school or homework then lead into the upcoming dance and eventually ask them if theyâd like to go with you   For example text a simple âSo are you planning to go to the danceâ or âSo do you have a date for the dance yetâ If your crush says no then ask âWould you like to go with meâ If your crush plans to go with friends ask if theyâll at least save you dance   Another easy relatively stressfree way to ask your crush to the dance is to leave them a note If youâre feeling bold you can pass them one in class for an immediate response However if youâre feeling a bit shyer simply slip a note asking if theyâd like to go with you into their locker You can even leave directions on the note like âCircle Y or N and slip this back into my locker by the end of the dayâ If not you may have to approach your crush directly for an answer If you want to make a bit more of an impression try making some sweet treats for your crush Find out their favorite cookie or cupcake and make them a bunch You can spell out D A N C EÂ  on top of the cupcakes in frosting For something more subtle hand out cupcakes or cookies to all your friends  girls and guys alike  and give your crush a special one with DANCE written on itIf your crush doesnât like sweets try doing this with a pizza   If youâve got the downtime in class or a study hall rope your crush into a game of hangman When itâs your turn to come up with a word or phrase mark out spaces for either D A N C EÂ  or âWill you go to the dance with meâ Then simply hold tight as you wait for your crush to figure it outYou can try this tactic with other games like Pictionary or Scrabble too   This might take a little bit more work but shouldnât be too expensive You can buy a big thing of fortune cookies online for around 10 Simply change out the fortune in one and then make sure to give it to your crush when youâre handing them out to friends or classmates Just make sure that your crush actually opens it and doesnât give it to someone else   This is a great idea if you and your crush have similar tastes in music Try putting together a bunch of songs you think your crush would like and write a message for them on the inside of the CD case You donât need to write anything long just âWould you like to go to the dance with meâ You could also just write âGo to the dance with meâ directly on the CD   Another cute idea is to put a note asking them to the dance in a bottle or mason jar You can then fill this jar with candies like jelly beans mms sour patch kids or any other sweet they like Just make sure that your note is big enough to be found and not get lost amongst the candy

If you and the girl who likes you arenât close but itâs clear that she likes you start small and bring up a common interest This will break the ice make things less awkward and establish a bond that you can progress fromIf youâre on the soccer team and sheâs on the volleyball team at school consider starting a conversation about sports Start a conversation about a class you have together by saying something like âIâm so glad that last chapter is over with What did you think about last nightâs readingâ  A unique tasteful compliment can go a long way Whether youâre referencing a physical characteristic or personality trait giving a girl a compliment is a great way to express your affection especially if you remain composed and relaxed when you do thisComplimenting her here and there is better because too often might make her annoyed or uneasy   If she tells you that she did well on a test that she got back today you might say âThatâs great It doesnât surprise me at all youâre very smart and hardworkingâ If she has particularly attractive blue eyes you might say âI really like your eyes Theyâre a very pretty blueâ   Smiling a lot and looking her in the eye at appropriate moments communicate that youâre confident and interested This is a good first step in beginning to flirt with her Be careful not to stare because excessive eye contact often seems creepy   Acknowledge her in the hallway by giving a casual wave smiling and making brief eye contact   Since she likes you she might lean in closer when talking to you or turn her hips torso and feet to face your directionMirror movements like these to show her that you like her too   Holding a door open for someone is always a nice gesture but doing it every time seems a little overthetop even to someone who likes you Avoid big gestures like giving her flowers because this might be offputting and overwhelming It isnât an appropriate time in your barely budding relationship to give a gift like this Wait until youâve been dating someone for a while If youâre shy liking one of her statuses on Facebook leaving her a sweet comment on an Instagram photo or even just friending or following her on social media are easier ways to show that you like her and are paying attention to her Especially since you like her back it might be tough to not text her several times in a row write long passages or confront her about not respondingThis usually comes off as clingy so as a good rule of thumb stay relaxed and text her as much as she texts you   In todayâs world texting has become the norm and calling a love interest is seen by many women as an act of courageIf your conversations in person and via text are long comfortable and natural calling is the next step to take
One of the easiest ways you can help to keep dolphins safe Leave them be You should never attempt to feed dolphins pet dolphins or interrupt their way of life if you should see them in the ocean or in some freshwater rivers   Avoid taking commercial cruise liners through endangered areas where youll likely encounter dolphin populations and coral reefs Its estimated that these ships destroy hundreds of yards of delicate coral every year which provide habitat and shelter for dolphins and other marine lifeEven if youre a big fan of dolphins and would like to see them up close seathemed parks and aquatic swimwithdolphins programs serve to keep dolphins in captivity where they experience significantly shorter life spans Improper physical contact with dolphins can transfer diseases making dolphins susceptible to fungal infections and a host of other problems Its much safer to leave them alone where they can live peacefully and happily  One of the most dangerous threats to dolphin populations is commercial fishing and the nets the fishermen use If you eat seafood its important to make careful and intelligent seafood purchases There are only so many fish in the sea and many commercial fishing operations do more harm than good while others harvest fish responsibly and sustainably So how can you be sure you know where your salmon tuna or shrimp are coming from Seafood Watch publishes a free annual watch list tracking the practices and the fishing statistics in the given you allowing you to make uptodate decisions and buy the safest seafood   The tuna fishing industry is the culprit most often blamed for dolphin deaths and dolphinsafe tuna is a label you can often find at grocery stores Thats an easy way to make a simple change but the problem is much larger than just tuna Make sure you stay informed and learn everything you can about the operation   Human waste is the number one contributing factor to the degradation of life in the oceans with 80 of marine pollution originating on landThe impact is enormous and even something as simple as releasing a helium balloon into the sky can end up contributing the garbage that chokes the dolphin population out Take steps now to reduce your nonbiodegradable garbage   It doesnt need to be complicated Take little steps by avoiding plastic coffee cups when you go to the coffee shop bringing your own reusable thermos instead Avoid packaged food and products with excessive plastic packaging choosing instead to purchase bulk groceries or used goods Reuse plastic bags and avoid getting new ones at the store The trash vortex is a patch of garbage that floats in the North Pacific ocean made up primarily of plastics Styrofoam and other garbage carried by the current into a single place where it swirls constantly Its the size of Texas and its full of dead oceanlife birds and other creatures that became ensnared in the waste If you want to save dolphins the impact of human waste on the ocean must be reduced immediately Its not just physical waste that interrupts the flow of life in the oceans Just as significant is air pollution which resettles into fresh water and flows back into the oceans making up about a third of contaminants in coastal areas   Our use of fossil fuels is directly related to the health of the oceans meaning that any steps you can take to reduce your carbon footprint from transportation will be directly linked to the safety of dolphins Start taking steps to drive less switch to more fuelefficient vehicles or seek alternate methods of transportation like walking riding your bicycle and sharing rides There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 65000 chemicals approved for use in commercial and industrial cleaners as well as automotive products and only about 300 of them have been tested for toxic properties We have no idea about the impact seemingly safe products have on the environmentOil tanker spills get a lot of airplay but sewage runoff sends twice as much oil into coastal waters every year Nonsource point pollution is extremely difficult to control or trace since it comes from the air though we can be sure that most of it is directly related to commercial pollutants and industrial waste   As the temperatures of the ocean change even by a few degrees the whole delicate balance of the sea habitat will be thrown off affecting the way dolphins and other sea creatures survive As populations dwindle itll become more and more difficult for dolphins to compete with other species for a reduced amount of food If the temperatures dont stabilize itll be very difficult for dolphins to survive   Reduce your energy consumption focus on reducing physical waste and make more informed purchases with commercial cleaners soaps and other household products to reduce your own impact Avoid anything with parabens phosphates and Styrofoam Aside from temperatures oxygen depletion is a major problem associated with global climate change Nitrogen and phosphorus are elements found in fertilizer commercial toxins and sewage which enter coastal waters and deplete the oxygen in the water Think of it as sucking the air out of a room the dolphins breathe in A single gram of nitrogen or phosphorus can deplete between 10 and 100 grams of oxygen in seawater While its fun to go see dolphins up close doing tricks these parks separate baby dolphins from their mothers keep them enclosed in tanks feed them drugs and force them to breed at exceptionally young agesTheyve also been accused of unsafe work environments for humans and dolphins alike making parks like SeaWorld dangerous and unethical Dont support them   The biggest thing you can contribute to the cause of dolphins is your voice If you care about keeping dolphins safe shout it from the rooftops and learn everything you can about the dangers that face the dolphin population in your area   Subscribe to dolphin watch organizations to keep uptodate on current efforts and legislation that you could contribute to and encourage others to participate in BlueVoice is an ocean conservation organization that works to save dolphins and whales specifically by tracking and fighting dolphin hunts in Japan and Peru You can join BlueVoice by signing up here Devote a considerable amount of your social media presence to dolphin causes and making others aware of whats going on in the oceans The more people know what to avoid and are aware of the threat that dolphins face the more changes can be made   In the 1970s the government passed a bill designed to keep dolphins and other marine mammals safe but it wasnt until the mid80s that stronger guidelines were put in place specifically related to tuna fishing The impact of these regulations made a huge difference then in the short term but little has been done in the decades since Its time to revisit the issue so you should let your representative know you mean business Get in touch immediately   Most communications happen online so you can usually visit your senatorial or congressional representatives website to learn more about how to get in touch directly Draft a letter laying out a specific plan of action and demand results or deny your vote during the next election cycle Changes specifically need to take into account the commercial and industrial pollutants and the way these contribute to the deaths of marine mammals   Lots of organizations are already in place fighting the good fight against pollution and ocean injustice Theyre often in dire financial straights however making any assistance you can offer extremely valuable This is an especially great way to contribute if youre busy to participate directly but feel passionately about the cause   Organizations like the International Fund for Animal Welfare IFAW Greenpeace BlueVoice and other groups are all devoted to saving the lives of dolphins and they all would appreciate financial help to continue the cause   Avoiding products and making smart purchases is a good step for you to take alongâevery single person makes a differenceâbut if you can rally the troops and make a more significant impact with larger numbers your contribution will be much greater   Try to work on changing your own household first getting everyone you live with to contribute to the proper consumer choices then start holding open meetings at a community center or church to share what you know and get others on board Getting in touch and spreading the word with letters to your local paper sharing links on social media and even making up posters can do a lot to share your message and let people know how they can make a difference   If youve got a growing group of likeminded people concerned about the plight of the dolphins consider starting your own activist group to organize protests boycotts and stage informationdisseminating meetings so that more and more people will become aware of the issues The more people involved the more the government will have to listen and make the changes necessary to take action Media is the strongest source of defense for fighting against the threats that harm dolphins   Declare your organization with the IRS and apply for nonprofit status if you grow large enough to have significant operating costs and want to start collecting donations from visitors to the site   If you want to take the next step from dolphinlover to professional defender of the dolphins going into marine biology is the biggest likely career choice This will not only allow you to be around the animals you love and hope to protect but will allow you to study the ways in which the environment of dolphins is affected by the human footprint and how to improve that environment   In school work hard in biology and take as many natural science classes as you can You wont start out by learning to scuba dive and swim with dolphins but youll be building the necessary foundation to possibly do something like that for a living When you get to college there probably wont be a marine biology major unless youre at certain coastal universities but getting a general biology degree will allow you to specialize at the graduate level Take your education one step at a time   For some people its not enough to donate some money and sit back to wait for changes passively If youre frustrated with the slow process that justice usually takes you might consider getting involved more directly with an activist group that works to disrupt the forces that endanger dolphins and other marine life   The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society The Animal Liberation Front ALF The Taiji Action Group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA Greenpeace   Many activist organizations Greenpeace especially organize userfriendly activism and signaturegathering operations to disrupt corporate attempts to maintain the statusquo These groups draw attention to the ways that corporations shirk their environmental responsibility to maximize profits and attempt to hold them to it It usually benefits industry to work unregulated and unimpeded by things like carbon caps and environmental restrictions which keeps the oceans polluted and dolphins in danger Work to change that   Much of the dubious decision making happens at the legislative level where corporate lobbyists work to change environmental legislation to indirectly benefit the entities that are destroying it It can be awfully confusing for the layman making your contributions to more professional organizations a lot easier than trying to go it alone   Get your organization to post up outside of heavy polluters and try to get as much media coverage as you possibly can spreading the word about how their pollution is affecting the dolphin population Greenpeace consistently organizes rallies and protests of major polluters which you can subscribe to even if youre not a contributing memberBe tenacious and be loud You probably wont get an oil company to start cleaning up their act just by waving some signs around but you can draw attention to whats happening get on television and make people start paying attention Throw the ball into their court Numbers are important but even small protests register if the cause is important enough and if youve got controversy on your side   Depending on the group you join you might end up cutting fishing nets in international waters or riding around on antiwhaling ships to get in the face of illegal whalers like a pirate or you might be mostly collecting signatures and combing

Even if its just for a few split seconds Itll put a guy in a little pickle if hes asked if he likes a girl he doesnt even know Try this when your friend isnt looking knock one of her books off of her desk Right in front of the guy then step away quickly If he isnt a jerk hell pick it up Now hell know who youre talking about when you ask if he likes your friend  If you stalk him showering him with questions hell probably be a little freaked out This is a turnoff At lunch go sit at his table if youre friends with one of his Then ask him if he doesnt reply give him time And ask the next week   He might be a little embarrassed if hes asked in front of his friends they might laugh at him or something But when you ask to see him in private make sure you sound casual Otherwise hell think that YOU like him   Most guys will say I dont know Maybe I gotta think about it Dont press him to much just try to get a definite answer   If he says yes then dont tell everyone at school Thats is a humongous turnoff   That is if she knows youre trying to set the two of them up If she doesnt dont say anything   Even if she doesnt know you were setting them up Make sure she goes and talks to him and they arrange the date Humbly take the million thankyous she gives you
Letters are a little more romantic than asking someone out by email or text and your crush may be flattered by your thoughtfulness   Make sure the letter contains no inappropriate content or anything that might make your crush uncomfortable You dont have to use flowery words Just simply ask them Would you like to go to the promdance with me Dont be afraid to sign your name or your crush might not know who asked himher out Since letters have more impact than an email or text does youll want to give your crush some time to think about it if heshe needs to Therefore you should send your crush the letter a little earlier than you would send a text or email to himher   Consider the pros and cons of each option above and choose the one that seems to go best with you   Keep in mind that mailing letters may take a while and youll never know when your crush may receive the letter Also your crushs parents might see the letter and your crush might be embarrassed Therefore its best to turn to other options rather than this one although it is an open choice for you   Dont expect himher to reply by letter although heshe might   If your crush agrees you can go shopping If your crush declines do not freak out Still keep maintaining that relationship with your crush and treat himher nicely It still has its chances of blossoming into a romantic bond Keep in mind that if you take this calmly your crush might change hisher mind
When you find out that your crush knows you like him dont let this turn your relationship into something awkward and unpleasant Try to continue talking about the things you normally would For example if you have classes together at school dont hesitate to talk to him about your assignments Keeping a casual attitude will make your interactions much easier   Keep in mind that he probably doesnt know that you know about him If you keep your cool you can buy a little extra time for yourself to come to grips with the situation  When youre worried about how your crush knows you like him constantly thinking about the situation is one of the worst things you can do Try to keep your mind off of him by staying busy with your daytoday activities You can even avoid him for a day or two if it gives you time to calm down although you wont want to do this for too long if you eventually plan on making a move   It can help if you dont think of the situation as a problem Its not necessarily a bad thing that he knows you like him After all would you be angry or upset if you knew someone liked you Probably not   Having a crush on someone can make even the most rational levelheaded people jealous Try not to get too invested in who your crush is talking toThe odds are that hes not playing hardtoget or doing it to hurt your feelings â hes just having friendly conversations with the people around him like he usually does   Hes also probably not talking about you so dont fall prey to paranoid thoughts like Hes telling everyone about how I like him Unless hes really immature he probably wouldnt even consider doing that   Your crush is just a normal everyday human being like you Many of the same things that make you nervous probably make you nervous Since he knows you like him he probably gets a few butterflies in his stomach when he talks to you Keeping this in mind can make it much easier to deal with him â how scary can talking to someone be when you know hes just as nervous as you
Donât feel like you have to respond right away Take a few seconds to collect your thoughts and take a deep breath If the question is really awkward and strange you want some time to respond appropriately It can be awkward if you say something that doesnât make sense If you like this person you should give them the benefit of the doubt that their question wasnât supposed to make you uncomfortable Donât become cold or angry immediately Smile and indicate that you still like this person and want to work out this awkwardness If you want to buy even more time ask your crush for clarification on what they asked you and why they asked Here are some example questions   What did you say What do you mean by that Why are you asking
How do you really feel about your friend Perhaps youâre just interested in getting to know them a little better or maybe youâve found that youâre attracted to them and want to get to know them from a different perspective Feelings are often confusing things Make sure youâve sorted out exactly how you feel and what you want before you try taking things to the next levelEven if youâre attracted to your friend you may decide that itâs advisable to take things slowly and cautiously if the two of you are already close  Think about the kind of âvibesâ you get from your friend Are the two of you close or do you just hang out with the same group of people Do they laugh at your jokes and show an interest in what you have to say when youâre talking Try to gauge your friendâs feeling as accurately as you can If itâs obvious that thereâs no real attraction being reciprocated it might be best to hold off on asking them out If they act warmly towards you however they may have similar feelings and might have even hoped youâd ask If you have another friend that knows the friend in question and you feel comfortable talking to them about the situation ask their thoughts on how you should proceed They probably know something you donât one way or the other or have unique insights into the matter that might not have occurred to you Your other friends will eventually find out if youre dating so donât make it look like you were keeping it a secret from them   If your other friends learn how you feel they may subtly talk to the friend you like facilitating the process Keep in mind that your other friends are affected by whether or not you start dating While this shouldnât necessarily prevent you from asking a friend out show enough respect to be conscientious about your evolving relationship with that friend and what consequences it might have   The next time your group of friends is hanging out look for opportunities to pair up or spend some time alone with the friend that you like This could be playing a game of pool together having a thoughtful oneonone conversation at a party or standing next to each other at a concert Get comfortable with the idea of being alone with your friend and try to also get a sense of how they feel about it in these moments If your friend gravitates to you during future hangouts itâs probably a good signDonât dole out your attention to your friends unfairly Take an opportunity to spend time alone with your friend if one arises but donât make them feel forced to split off and ignore the rest of your company   Donât expect too much to happen too soon if at all Even if your friend likes you back they may be reluctant to do anything that might jeopardize the relationship that the two of you currently have Whatever your friend decides you should be okay with it If you get too set on the idea of dating it may come as a disappointment if your friend declines which could create distance between the two of you as friendsLearn to take ânoâ for an answer If your friend agrees to spend time with you oneonone but makes it known that theyâre uneasy with the dating label accept their position graciously and plan to find something casual to do Put whatever misgivings they have about endangering your friendship to rest by assuring them that youâll remain friends regardless of how things turn out   You should be taking your friendâs feelings into consideration as well as your own If theyâve been giving you flirtatious signals it might be a clue that theyâre interested in you and will agree to a date If they seem disinterested or youâre having trouble reading their feelings they may be uncomfortable with the idea Recognizing the appropriate point to ask a friend on a date will most often come down to personal judgmentItâs probably better not to ask your friend out in a group setting where they may feel pressure to respond in a certain way   The best way to ask someone on a date in most circumstances is facetoface However since you and your friend already have an established platonic relationship asking them out directly may be awkward or make them feel pressured Weigh your options A friendly phone call might do it or you could drop the proposition during a text conversation Your friend will probably be most amenable to the idea of going on a date if it doesnât feel like a big deal so donât make it oneThink about how your friend does most of their communicating and go with their preferred mode That way nothing feels off when it comes time to broach the subject   Once youâve determined how youâre going to ask work the offer naturally into a conversation with your friend or be collected and upfront about it The two of you are already friends so there should be a mutual degree of respect and comfort in place Frame the question in a way that reinforces that the decision is theirs and that you want to remain friends either wayIt might be easiest to suggest that just the two of you do something together as friends sometime since this will cause no initial concern of changing the nature of the relationship If your desire is to continue dating as more than friends though make sure youâre displaying your intentions honestly If your friend declines your offer smile and carry on in an amiable manner He or she will likely be worried about straining the friendship if they turn you down Make sure that they know youâre still happy to be their friend Itâs possible that the time just wasnât right but now that your friend is aware of your feelings they may in time discover that theyâre attracted to you as well   No matter how things progress between you your friendship is the foundation of your relationship and the most important thing This thought should feel like a safety net for you when youâre mustering the nerve to ask your friend out If itâs not what your friend wants or theyâre not yet open to the possibility youâll have your friendship to fall back on and you should a true friend will understand and be there to make sure everything is okay Even if you start dating and things are going well donât forget that they were your friend first The comfort of that bond will make your connection even stronger   Try to think of your new relationship as a branching outgrowth of your friendship not a replacement for it All of your interactions should come from a place of caring and acceptance Thereâs no reason for the friendship to suffer simply because youâre trying to build on it   Dating a friend can sometimes cause complications if you tend to hang around the same people Be upfront with your other friends about the situation and let them know that it wonât alter the friendship of the group Take particular care not to isolate yourselves when youâre with your mutual friends this can be easy to do when you first begin to date someone but it might give the rest of your friends the impression that youâre disinterested in them Since you began as friends work on cultivating an environment where you can still spend time together even when youâre involved with someoneMake some time each week for all of your friends to get together During this time involve yourself in the groupâs activities and discussions and donât make it feel like you and the friend you like are separating yourselves from the rest of your friends If your dating efforts arenât met with success donât let it come between you and your friend You knew to keep your expectations out of the picture so thereâs no need to take it too hard Not wanting to date may just mean that he or she values you very highly as a friend which is a good thing Thereâs no harm in liking someone and you shouldnât feel awkward or guilty if you tried and things didnât work out In the worst case scenario you can simply go back to being friends Itâs a winwinYou shouldnât be embarrassed or feel the need to âpunishâ your friend if things donât work Withdrawing from your friend group will make you appear sulky and may send the message that you were only looking to date the person from the beginning Allowing resentment to build up will take its toll on your friendship which is precisely what you donât want to happen   Whether you hit it off on your date or you donât take pleasure in being around one another Starting off as friends means you already know you have common interests can communicate openly and like spending time together Look at it as a chance to spend some quality time with the person with no thought to the outcome Do things that you both enjoy and relish the occasion to make new experiences and memories with the friendship at the heart of your relationshipFor a first date keep things from feeling too serious by suggesting a short hike or picnic outside a casual dinner at one of your favorite restaurants followed by coffee or a movie

Its important to get your kissing technique right for the first kiss Start by slightly tilting your head to one side just enough to ensure your noses dont crash Tilt in the opposite direction to him  if he goes right you go left   If hes taller than you you should also tilt your head upwards slightly to make sure he can easily reach your lips Just dont tilt your head too much or itll look like you have a crick in your neck   Closing your eyes when kissing makes it a much more romantic and sensory experience However you shouldnt close your eyes until youre sure you know exactly where youre going  if you close your eyes too soon you may end up kissing his nose or chin Try to keep your eyes closed for the duration of the kiss  if you open your eyes and he opens his it can be a little creepy and might ruin the moment   Sometimes closing your eyes will come naturally but other times you will have to remind yourself Leave your eyes closed for a second when you pull apart then smile gently and open   Dont be an aggressive kisser at least not for the first kiss Your first kiss with a guy should be soft and slow  you want to avoid the washingmachine effect Try not to pucker your lips rather work your bottom lip in a slight upanddown motion Remember to breath through your nose and try to stay relaxed   Theres no pressure to French kiss first time round but if you do you should try gently massaging his tongue with your own If youre still unsure just try to follow his lead   Make the kiss more intimate by putting your hands on his shoulders in his hair or around his neck Keep your bodies as close as you feel comfortable with If he wraps his hands around your waist or cups your face in his hands hes definitely into it   The first kiss shouldnt wear out his jaw you should always leave him wanting more Try to keep it around the 20 second mark  long enough to get into it but short enough that hell be eager to do it again Dont be afraid to pull away if youre not into it or if its going somewhere youre not comfortable with   Remember that he was probably as nervous about kissing you as you were about kissing him so once youve pulled away ease his nerves by smiling and confirming that you enjoyed the kiss Just say something simple like that was fun or youre a great kisser Hell feel happy and relieved while also feeling much more confident about leaning in for round two Now you have him exactly where you want him
Before walking right up like a bundle of nerves take a moment to collect yourself Breathe slow and deep to the count of ten to help yourself relax Remind yourself of your best qualities and make those the ones you display to your crush Whatâs the worst that could happen If you donât talk to him or her youâll regret it and that first spark could just be the start of something fantasticWhich of your characteristics are you most proud of Can you get along with anyone Are you athletic Do you have a good sense of humor Keep these traits in mind when working up your nerve to talk to your crush and give them the chance to get to know the good things about youItâs possible that you feel intimidated by your crush if theyâre extremely attractive or popular but for all you know they may feel the same way about you  Seeing your crush surrounded by his or her friends might make you even more nervous Try to find a time when theyâre alone and nearby when you can start a conversation without having to worry about being interrupted or met with other judging eyesLook for your crush between classes or another time when theyâre less likely to be with a big group   Create a scenario that will give you an opportunity to make the introduction If your crush drops something you might return it to them for instance or if you see him or her talking to a mutual friend you could use the connection as an icebreaker Taking advantage of little openings will keep you from appearing desperate or having to walk up and start talking out of the blueBe enthusiastic but keep your cool Donât let yourself appear overly excited If you have a class with your crush ask them to clarify the details of a homework assignment as way of opening communication Chances are that anxious feeling you get before talking to your crush is never going to disappear entirely so at some point youâll have to just take a deep breath and go for it Seize your opening when it presents itself Start by introducing yourself if you havenât met or by asking a question to get them engaged if youâre already acquainted Getting the conversation started is usually the scariest part so once thatâs out of the way you can carry on the interaction at easeBoldness often pays off You wonât know if the person you have a crush on is also interested in you unless you talk to them Make peace with the idea of rejection Your crush will probably be happy to talk to you once you get the ball rolling but in the event that things donât go as you hoped just shrug it off Itâs always better to try and strike out than live with never knowing with what might have happened
Sometimes the best way to get the information you want is to be blunt Being this way doesnât leave any wiggle room for misinterpretation and gets you a straight answer   For example invite your friend out to coffee and say âIâm just wondering if you have feelings for my boyfriend Some of the things you do and ways you behave make me suspiciousâ Your friend may get their feelings hurt but itâs better to know You will have to become more direct if they donât get the hint or they continue their behavior Your friendship is compromised anyways because of their flirting so telling them to stop talking to your man wonât do additional harm   For example you can say âIâm not sure if youâre trying to be funny or if you donât realize youâre flirting but itâs making me uncomfortable and I want you to stopâ Try to say this to them when you are alone Making a scene in front of people will only make the situation worse Stop bringing your friend around your boyfriend or end the relationship with them all together if the flirting doesnât stop Itâs clearly not a good friendship in the first place if your friend doesnât respect you or your relationship enough to back off
Thats probably her making sure she looks nice It means she is nervous on how she looks and normally if it was a regular guy that walked into the room she wouldnt bother to check If she doesnt look as nervous then dont get your hopes down Some girls try to hide it and act normal They dont want you to know Stay tuned theres other ways to notice  If she looks at you three or more separate times she probably likes you rarely the looks will be one right after the other This means she notices you more than a regular guy who walks into the room Dont think she likes you right away   Both of these means she likes you   does she play with her hair while talkinglooking at you   Maybe she likes you   They can be a big help   She likes your company then   Now as a best friend you should directly ask her She maybe saying I like him but deep inside once she will like you but you should be the one to make the first move   Â she may just be a nice person or wants to get close to you   Well 10 she likes you but the other 90 if you deserve justice then any girl will stand for you

for all types of people Save the more specialized jokes for when you know her better   Make funny comments about the things around you Maybe you notice a large pushpull sign on a door and think its overstated Make a joke about it such as Could that sign be any bigger I think we get the point then exaggerate your movements as you push the door open Or maybe pretend the sign is wrong by pretending to pull and acting like it isnt working It will let her know you are attentive to your surroundings and show her that you can come up with humor on the spotYou can also incorporate sarcasm into these types of situations If you see someone with a large truck say something like I think that guy should buy a bigger truck I hear the prices of Mac trucks are down this year Dry wit is usually appreciated and will make her laugh Just make sure you dont only talk in sarcastic remarks She might think you are a negative person and not want to be around you Find small things about her that you can pick on Make a joke about how large her handbag is or the size of her sunglasses anything that is small and unimportant For example ask her Plan on robbing a bank later I think you can use your purse as the getaway car Remember to keep your tone light and keep a smile on your face You dont want her to think you are actually making fun of herDont take it too far and hurt her feelings Stay away from topics like her weight what she looks like or other things that might be a sore subject You dont want to make her think youre mean or cause major offense so early in your courtship Try making fun of yourself as well This lets her know that you have a sense of humor about yourself and you dont take yourself too seriously Say something like Im a great driver Today I even got a note complimenting my skills that said Parking Fine Just remember not to take it too far and become too selfdeprecating You can liven up any moment with a bit of physical humor Pretend to run into a door falling down and acting hurt You can also do a silly dance pretend like you are going to jump on her back for a piggyback ride or play wrestle with her Its a more active way to make her giggle and can have the benefit of amusing those around you as well   You can also tickle her or pretend to mess up her hair This allows you to touch her in a playful way that is different than holding her hand or putting your arm around her Nothing is better than a great impression to get someone to laugh Pick a celebrity that you know she likes or someone you both know like a mutual friend or a professor This way she wont miss out on the joke and can be laughing along with you   Make sure you test out your impressions on others before you try to impress your crush You dont want her to be laughing at you because your impression is so bad instead of with you because its great
Cleaning feeding grooming exercising and ensuring a supply of fresh water is available for your animals takes time See how long it takes you each day to properly care for all the animals you own Compare this with the amount of free time you have available after other obligations are met such as work school family time etc Make sure you wonât be neglecting another area of your life to care for all your animals   Always remember to take care of your pets If you dont have time to take care of them all or dont remember which ones you have taken care of that day you may have to get rid of some of them Some animal types will require different maintenance A longhaired dog for example probably needs to be brushed daily while a cat can groom himself Bird and hamster cages need to be cleaned out and disinfected often with soiled bedding removed regularly Be sure to consider the total amount of time you spend on all caretaking tasks for each animal you own each day week and month The amount of free time you have available and are willing to spend caring for pets will determine how much time you spend with them However if it takes over two to three hours to take care of all your animals every day then you may already have too many pets  Consider what your living arrangements are âhow large is the living area and yard space you have for your animals If you live in a small upstairs apartment without a yard then take that into account when thinking about how many animals you can house If you live out in the country on several acres then you can probably keep more animals Remember that each animal needs to have enough room to walk around and not be in a cramped space   While space definitely needs to be considered so that everyone can live together comfortably time is the more important factor here If you have the time to walk your dogs then providing a large area to run in is not as important as making sure you can take them for walks every day to meet their exercise needs   Your health status is an important factor to consider when getting more pets Be aware of what you can and cannot handle without assistance If you have difficulty getting around on your own another pet may not be the best idea   Also consider your mental health status Depression can make it very difficult to care for yourself as well as pets Your animals rely on you so not taking on more than you can handle is very important for everyoneâs wellbeing Animals can cause stress and contribute to mental health problems such as anxiety You are responsible for your pets The more animals you have the more their needs health issues and behavior can weigh on you   Though the number of pets you have can give you an idea of whether you already have a lot the resources that you have available are more important than the actual number of animals you ownYou need to be able to care for and provide an enriching environment for all your animals so that they can be happy and bring you joy as companions instead of more life stressConsider what species of animals you have as well as individual temperaments and group sexual dynamics before getting another pet   Overcrowding may have a negative effect on the pets you already have For example its recognized that in household with five cats or more there is a high likelihood of inappropriate spraying in order to mark territory This is because the cats view the presence of other cats as a threat The more cats the bigger the perceived threat So consider whether or not its fair to take on another pet if it adds to the stress of your existing pets If you cant count all your pets or lose count you have too many pets and shouldnât get any more While some people may look down on a person with 10 cats as long as the owner can provide a sanitary place to live afford medical care and emergency services for each cat as well as meet their own needs and pay bills then there isnât a problem The pack mentality can increase as you get more dogs and this can cause more behavioral problems because the social dynamics become more complex and your ability to give attention to each animal is lessenedMixing male and female animals can increase competition Hormones territorial tendencies and breeding behavior all contribute to problems you will have to deal with Keep this in mind before adding new pets to the ones you already have   Write down your expected expenses and income for the month Use bank statements receipts and bills to help determine what youâre spending every month Include your house or rent payment car payments insurance groceries gas utilities and other spending Be sure to include all the expenses related to your pets such as food grooming toys bedding supplies medications and healthcare costs   Doing this will allow you to see how much you are spending on your pets every month Consider how adding another pet will change these numbers Is it something you still want to do   Looking at the numbers what could you afford if you didnât have so many pets Look at yearling savings as well as monthly This can really show you whether another pet is worth it or not   If you didnât have pets could you increase your entertainment costs or pay for a car Could you take that trip youâve been wanting to take Now think about the monthly and yearly costs associated with getting another pet What will you have to cut out of your budget and lose   Donât skip meals to pay for your catsâ litter Make sure you get the nutrition you need and can pay your bills on time If youâre regularly making late rent payments or not going to the doctor so you can buy your dogsâ food then you probably donât need another pet   Medical care for animals can be expensive â sometimes thousands of dollars a visit Youâll want to be able to save up money regularly in case you need to pay for emergency care or buy prescription medications for your animals You need to be financially prepared for each animal that you own   Keep up to date with shots Many young animals need a series of vaccinations the first year and regular rabies vaccinations after that If you have multiple animals pet insurance may be a good option Be sure you can make your payments every month and pay any remaining balances for each pet   Your apartment or neighborhood may have rules that dictate the size breed and number of animals you can have Check your lease talk to your landlord or your neighborhood association to find out if there is a limit to how many animals you can keep on your property   Your local animal control and zoning laws probably dictate how many animals you can keep on your property Governing bodies do this in order to prevent unsanitary unhealthy conditions for residents You will want to call animal control or talk to your city or county administrative office to find out what the local laws are so you can remain in compliance   Pet hoarding or having too many pets than you can take care of is likely in violation of your state city county or other local health and zoning laws You could lose your pets and even your house Many cities and counties require animals to be registered and licensed In order to license pets the pet often has to be spayed or neutered or a breeder license purchased and all shots be up to date You can be fined or jailed if you do not have all your pets legally licensed   Because you are responsible for your pets and your children having too many pets can compromise your ability to care for your children If you canât keep your property and home clean or neglect your animals you can be charged with child neglect or endangerment as well Make sure your children are taken care of before you consider getting anymore pets   The more animals you have the more odors and noise they create Donât get so many pets that your neighbors start complaining The size of your residence will play a factor in this as well â an apartment is going to be right next to another apartment whereas you probably have some space between houses   Many apartments and cities have noise ordinances Check with yours to make sure that adding another barking dog wonât be a problem   Some people have a mental illness that causes them to have more than the typical number of pets They are unable to meet minimal care requirements and cannot recognize that they have a problem â even when animals become ill or die You will need to contact your local police or health department or humane society if you or someone you know suffers from this conditionThe unsanitary conditions of pet hoarding also negatively affect the community by increasing the risk of fire creating poor air quality attracting pests and encouraging the transmission of infectious diseases It is in your best interest to report suspected pet hoarding cases When animals do not have access to enough food live in unhygienic conditions or donât get medical care itâs considered to be animal cruelty If you suspect you may be a pet hoarder seek professional help right away   If you find that you canât support the pets you have or take care of them then you need to give up some of them You and your animals all deserve to have a good quality of life If you can no longer give them the attention time space or provide the food or medical care that they need you must allow them a chance to get the care they deserve with someone else   Friends family members and coworkers might be able to take one off your hands If not there are many rescue groups shelters and animal sanctuaries that can help Put an add up in your local paper at a local pet shop feed store or on an online site like craigslistcom for the animals you need to give up   If you can no longer take care of extra animals you can still help out in other ways Support documented 501c3 corporations with a reputation for providing highquality animal care however you can Your local shelter can always use your help as well
Confidence is one of the most attractive qualities a person can possess You dont have to be super sexy or built like Chris Hemsworth either All confidence requires is a firm belief in your own selfworth If you believe it that girl you like Shes going to believe it tooIt takes time and a little effort to build your confidence especially if youre starting from a low point Even if you dont believe in yourself pretend like you do Faking confidence actually tricks your brain into believing that you are confidentStand up straight when youre walking like you matter Take up space like crossing your ankle across your knee when youre sitting Leaning nonchalantly against a nearby surface Avoid crossing your arms across your chest or not making eye contact when you talk to people Both of these are defensive gestures  Part of being confident is being yourself and being okay with who that is Trying to change yourself to be someone else isnt going to work with her Shes going to see that youre not comfortable with yourself and that youre lying about who you are and she wont be pleased   Show what makes you unique and why youre interesting You dont have to walk around wearing a pocket protector do people do that anymore but you dont have to hide that youre interested in computers She will accept you and if she doesnt shes probably not worth your time Dont try to be someone else especially if youre trying to be the person you think she wants If she isnt interested in the person you are shes not the girl for you   Its hard to attract the girl that you like when you overwhelm her with your smell and your greasy hair Try to shower at least a couple times a week and use soap Wear clothes that have been recently laundered Reusing jeans and trousers is fine as long as they arent super dirty but change your shirt each day   Be careful about using aftershave or cologne A little goes a long way You dont want to approach the girl you like in a cloud of cologne Keep it down to a little spritz if you have to do wear it Make sure to smell the deodorants before you buy them so you know how strong they smell and what they smell like Again you dont want to overwhelm her with smell but a little deodorant especially if youve just played a game like soccer or basketball will make you seem much more put together   Another incredibly important thing to remember is that you need to have your own life Dont only focus on this one girl and try to be around her 247 It wont win you any prizes with her In fact youll come across as needy and pathetic and shell be far less likely to be interested in you   Pursue your own interests If youre into soccer join a team and play games You could even if youre feeling brave invite her to come watch a game or to kick around a soccer ball with you This will mean you have your own friends to hang out with even if your groups overlap Do things with your buddies rather than doing things only when you know that shell be there or doing things only with her This doesnt mean that you ignore her completely Of course not When you see her around either at school or at mutual events ask her what shes been up to and mention some of the things youve been doing like teaching yourself a language going rock climbing kicking butt on Call of Duty
This will help distinguish you from the crowd as well as show your crush that you have a cool sense of fashion It may impress them and perhaps even be the opening for a conversation Be sure that your clothes complement your body type and that your colors match Although you dont have to wear expensive clothing make sure that you have ones of good quality  Its important to seem as appealing as possible so that your crush may take an interest in you Take care of your personal hygiene such as showering brushing your teeth and washing your face to get rid of grime Add a subtle but pleasant scent by using deodorant cologne or body spray Be sure that your hair is styled neatly but make sure that you dont add too much product otherwise itll weigh your hair down and give it a false or grimy appearance   Be sure to adjust your body so that you appear open and inviting Make sure that youre not positioned in a manner that may seem closed off or discourage your crush from talking to you ex arms crossed You could also show some subconscious indications that youre interested in your crush   Confidence can completely change a persons appearance and help them seem more attractive It shows that youre proud of who you are and that you arent afraid to be unique Although you should avoid being cocky be sure that you give off a confident cheerful air

Before you approach your crush you want to ease into the dance and get comfortable Talking with your friends is a great way to spend the first part of the dance It also can show your crush if they are watching that you are a social and friendly person  Even if you are nervous at the prospect of talking to your crush try to have confident body language from the beginning of the dance to the end of the night Stand up straight smile and donât try to hide yourself People naturally attracted to confident and positive body language and if your crush sees you looking uncomfortable or worried they might not want to danceEven if you feel nervous smiling and standing up straight can actually trick your body into feeling calmer and more confident Thatâs why even if you are nervous you should fake it till you make it Try not to cross your arms or use other closed body language that hides your body Also try not to hang your head instead keep it up with your chin level Also try not to fidget or anxiously tap your feet as this will make you look nervous   If you are comfortable dancing dance with your friends at the beginning of the dance This will show your crush that you like dancing and may be open to the idea of dancing with themTry not to dance with another guy or girl If it seems like you like someone else your crush will be less likely to dance with you   If you see your crush looking in your direction look at them and smile Only do this if your crush is nearby or if they are looking at or near you If you stare at them intensely that might come across more creepy than cuteMaking this nonverbal contact is a good first step because it opens up the window for them to come over and say hello or even ask you to dance
These can cause you to feel a little giddy lightheaded and possibly invincible Or you may have rosecolored glasses about the whole situation thinking that this person is perfect and that nothing else matters As such your giddier feelings are liable to contain elements of fantasy and can be a source of causing you to feel uncomfortable around your crush because you only see their virtues and not their whole self  Use this knowledge to keep your head screwed on as you investigate the potential of this relationship longer term Acknowledge that while your feelings are normal for someone falling for another person they are somewhat inflated and liable to lead you astray Try your best to keep them under control by reminding yourself that slow and steady wins the race and that its important to think through your feelings before acting on them Most of all its vital to get to know your crush better warts and all   Crushing on someone you know little about can lead to unreasonable expectations and can cause you to fantasize that this person is someone theyre actually not By getting to know him or her you can be assured that this person is someone youd like to date or maybe youll discover a good friend is the better option   Spending time together without creating expectations can ease your discomfort Learn what this person cares about likes to do and considers of interest Do these things match your own interests While you dont need to have the exact same interests in everything having a few common interests will be essential to being able to share experiences stories and news with each other and itll enable both of you to have things to do together   Avoid pretending that you enjoy doing or participating in something that you dont just to please your crush This can turn out to be a deal breaker later on when your crush discovers how you truly feel It is far better to be honest You can even say that you dont much like the activity or interest but youre willing to give it a go but wont keep it up if it still doesnt excite you At least thats honest and your crush knows where they stand with you   Remember each person is the whole packageââwonderful things iffy things and vicesââjust like you There is a Spanish sayingââif you dont love a persons flaws then its not love at all Think of that when youre trying to work out whether this person is right for you This may seem hard to consider while youve got rosecolored glasses about this person but knowing understanding and accepting a persons flaws early on can be the pathway to a longterm and harmonious relationship It can also help to ease your discomfort knowing that your crush isnt all perfection   In the days when youre trying to get to know this person easy does it If they feel that youre always hanging around always asking questions and always sticking your nose into their business they may begin to feel crowded and they may feel uncomfortable themselves It is best to pace out your hanging around together remembering that its always better to leave a person wanting more of you than feeling theyd rather see less   Dont start hanging around your crush more than your real and close friends Doing so will make it obvious you like the person more than as a friend and your own friends will feel peeved at being sidelined   Avoid speeding things up or trying to show your deeper interest at this stage As soon as you try to do either of those things its likely that youll begin to feel uncomfortable and start to do things that can scare off your potential date or can cause you to look strange Keep reminding yourself that at this stage all youre doing is getting to know this person better and that there is nothing to be uncomfortable about   Avoid listening to what others have to say They might give indications that your crush does does not might or might not like you Frankly its none of their business and theyre not the two of you Just smile and nod politely whenever others try to give you advice You can take it or leave it but you dont need to act on it or agree with it Its eventually up to you to decide whether or not youll ask this person out   Yet its done every day by thousands of people everywhere so take heart from this and prepare yourself for the big question Expect to feel the jitters to be nervous and to feel some discomfort The question asking itself is a scary process However your crush is a not a scary personââyouve taken the time to get to know him or her better and youre friends From here things are going to be sorted out between you so have faith that youre doing the right thing   Rehearsal is the great way to quell discomfort At least that way youll have some lines already worked out and itll feel easy than stumbling into asking out your crush Write down your lines then practice them beforehand It might help to say them in front of the mirror or it might notââtry anyway to see how you feel While ultimately you must decide what lines to deliver to your crush some suggestions include   Hey R I was wondering how you feel about going to the X competition together this weekend I know you love X and I do too and I thought itd be a great way to spend a first date together B I was hoping youd be interested in coming to X event with me tomorrow as a date Im happy to drive us A little more intimate Hey S weve been spending a lot of time together lately and Ive grown close to you I would love to go on a date with you soon How do you feel about that   Your crush may not be ready to answer you immediately or your crush may answer like lightning Either way be ready for the answer   If its yes youre off to a new start together Say something like Thats great or Cool Ill start organizing it now If its no or I need more time be gracious Say that you understand and that you just hoped there might be a chance but you accept their decision   It signals that this person doesnt feel compatibility with you and thats at least honest and fair It also shows that you have the courage to put yourself out there and ask the questions that need asking Sometimes the answers wont be to your liking but other times they will be At least youve given it your best shot Now you can think about what didnt work and try differently next time with a new crush
Make sure you know how much money you can comfortably spend on the saddle While some saddles are quite expensive others can be found in a more reasonable price range Affordable quality saddles can be purchased for 500 to 1000 Higher end saddles are in the 1000 to 2000 range and up   Whatever your budget talk to your saddle shop openly and ask them to help you find a quality saddle that you can afford Say something like âI want to find a saddle for trail riding that is less 1000 Can you recommend something of good quality in that price rangeâ If you cannot afford to pay large amounts of money for a saddle consider purchasing a used product Used saddles are often available from riding stables tack stores and even from fellow riders Before purchasing a used saddle make sure it fits your horse well An illfitting saddle can lead to injury for the horse or rider Keep in mind that many saddles do not come with cinches stirrups and girths so these will be an additional expense  A good salesman can convince you youâre getting the deal of a lifetime regardless of how much youâre paying Thatâs why itâs important to do your research before hand A simple way to find current pricing is to do an online search for the type of saddle you wish to purchase You can also visit several different saddle retailers and compare prices Talk to other horse owners or riders about where they buy quality saddles at the best prices There are several indicators that youâre dealing with a trustworthy retailer First the shop should allow you a trial period with your saddle to ensure it fits both you and your horse A reputable saddle shop will also have a reasonable return or exchange policy if your saddle does not work out   Do not purchase saddles from a retailer who refuses to allow you to try out the saddle or who is unwilling or unable to provide details about the saddleâs materials and design English and Western are the two basic kinds of saddle but there are actually countless variations of the two English saddles are smaller lighter and allow you to be closer to the horse Western saddles are larger and they require padding between the horse and saddle The most noticeable difference between the two is the horn on the Western saddle   English saddles are available in a variety of styles for different uses For instance deeper seated saddles are used for dressage stylized horse riding competition Western saddles come in many styles and they are often decorated with artistic flourishes in the leather Your riding style will play a crucial part in determining what type of saddle is best Individuals who wish to participate in dressage polo or even horse racing will require an English saddle In contrast those who wish to ride on trails or work on ranches or farms may prefer a Western saddle   If you plan to use the saddle for a variety of activities itâs usually best to select a saddle for the activity you will engage in most often If more than one rider will be using the saddle make sure each rider has input on the purchase and is able to try the saddle Saddles are made from wood or metal that has been carefully shaped and is then covered with leather or a synthetic material When purchasing a saddle make sure to ask about the materials and how they impact the lifespan of the saddle Purchasing a saddle made from synthetic materials is a viable way to save money   Be aware that saddles made from synthetic materials typically do not last as long as those made from leather On both English and western saddles youâll need to make sure there is enough space between the arched front portion of the saddle pommel and the withers With someone in the saddle place three fingers vertically between the saddle and withers If you can do this comfortably the saddle fits well If itâs a tight squeeze or your fingers donât fit at all the saddle is too tight   For the English saddle have a helper move the horseâs foreleg while your fingers remain between the withers and pommel to ensure the saddle isnât impeding shoulder movement This is the underlying support that determines the basic shape of the saddle If you have a very large or very small horse you may struggle to find a saddletree that fits just right but checking for it is simple With a rider in the saddle place three fingers horizontally between the horsesâ shoulder and the saddle on both sides Just like with the pommel this is a quick and easy way to gauge whether or not the saddle size and shape fits your horse Stand at the back of your horse and look at the saddle without a rider seated With the horseâs head down you should be able to see light If you canât see light the saddle is too tight This light check lets you know your horseâs saddle is snug but not tight Itâs important to make sure you fit in your saddle The shape and length of the saddle should accommodate you comfortably Otherwise you may not want to ride as often In English saddles you should have four inches of saddle in front and behind your body Western saddles have four inches in front with your backside rested against the cantle raised back portion at the back of saddle You shouldnât feel pressed against the cantle to achieve the four inches of space in the front of the saddleEnsure western saddles fit with your saddle pad by trying it on your horse Western saddles need to have about an inch of padding between saddle and horse In many cases you may need to purchase an extended cinch to accommodate the added padding Saddles are often selected with a particular horse in mind If your horse is relatively small or young you will want to look for a lighter smaller saddle By contrast larger horses can handle heavier saddles with greater ease If you plan to use your saddle on a number of horses you can choose a saddle to accommodate your largest horse and use additional padding when necessary For the first few rides after purchasing a new saddle youâll need to closely watch the way your horse behaves If you notice a change in their posture behavior or ability to run or jump your saddle may not be a good fit for the horse For this very reason most reputable saddle retailers have a return policy that allows for a trial period

feet in the same position as his hands and feet If youre having coffee take a sip when he doesPick up some his expressions If he has a tendency to say Wow thats interesting for example use this phrase on occasion Dont make it too obvious He may think youre making fun of him Imitate his gestures on occasion but dont copy every single thing he does   Being attractive certainly helps someone notice

romantic attentionWear clothing that makes you feel good about yourself and that you feel comfortable in You dont have to try to look like anyone but yourself   If you lack self confidence youre less likely to come off as attractive to other people Having a strong sense of who you are will help your guy friend notice you Do not simply agree with what he sees and smile and nod Show off who you are while flirtingThink about how you see yourself as a person Do you see yourself as smart funny spontaneous serious studious However you see yourself work on showing off that side for him For example if youre a movie buff dont hesitate to share your knowledge while the two of you hang out and watch movies   Its natural to develop feelings for someone if you spend a lot of time with that person Try to frequent the same places he does If you know he hangs out at a local coffee shop spend time there Invite him out with your friends for group gatherings Go to social events where you know youll see himIf you go to school together try to interact with him frequently at school Talk to him between classes Sit by him in class whenever possible Have lunch with him   People want to date those who are similar to them If you have a lot in common play up these similarities Do and say things to make him notice how alike you are For example if you both like a particular director talk about movies by that directorMaybe both of you are really interested in science fiction books or basketball Find your common ground and emphasize it   If youre genuinely intrigued by some of his interests explore them For instance you can listen to a band he likes and then chat with him about it the next day You could even ask him to check out their concert with you   Be yourself Dont force yourself to be interested in things that dont appeal to you just because he likes them   As friends you may already hang out alone sometimes Work on having a little more oneonone time with him This will give you a chance to get flirty in order to gain his attention If youre nervous go to a big social event and spend some time alone with him thereFor example ask him to a party and then find a cozy corner where the two of you can chat You can also try to hang out oneonone in casual settings For example grab a cup of coffee together after school   If youre having trouble getting a guy to notice you try touching him whenever possible This can help him think of you in a more romantic sense For example when youre having coffee together try brushing his arm slightly when youre talking Lean into him a little while youre watching a movie togetherDo something flirty and playful like tussling his hair Hug him on occasion A cozy hug once in awhile can eventually lead to more   Many people feel more comfortable transitioning into dating gradually Try asking him what hes doing this weekend and when he responds suggest something the two of you could do together instead For example Bowling sounds fun this weekend but I have tickets to this concert if you want to go with meTry asking him for advice on somewhere to go and then ask him to go with you For example say Where do you get good pizza in this town When he answers say something like Oh cool Hey since you like that place maybe we could go together   If hes not getting the hint dont be afraid to make the first move Many guys actually appreciate when a potential romantic partner makes the move for them Guys are shy too so dont be afraid to make the first moveRemember this guy is your friend This can help take some pressure off A friend is more likely to be polite and let you down easy as well   When asking him out go at your own pace Rushing through things can make you look nervous making you both feel anxious in the situation You want to start things off in a good place so slowly work your way up to asking him out when the time comesDo not rush through your words When the two of you do interact oneonone allow conversation to happen naturally for a bit before making your move If youre feeling nervous take a few deep breaths to calm yourself   If indirect invitations arent working its time to be bold about your feelings Simply say something like So I feel a strong romantic connection with you Would you like to go out on a date some time You want to proceed with your relationship friendship or otherwise with no confusionWhile this may feel very bold many people appreciate it when youre straightforward You can also emphasize how important his friendship is to you You could say something like âI really do love being your friend and if you arenât into me in a romantic way I just want you to know that I am happy with just being friends Nothing about our friendship will change I want to continue having fun with you and being your friendâ   Even if youve done everything right theres still a chance your guy friend just wont see you in that way Remember this hurt will fade with time While it seems like

Before you begin the process of haltering your horse youll need to prepare the halter If your horse is acting up it can be hard to prepare the halter in the moment   Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece This is the strap of the halter that goes behind the horses ears It should have a buckle or snap somewhere on it Have your halter clipped to your lead line ahead of time You want to be able to halter your horse and immediately lead him where he needs to go You clip the lead line onto a ring at the bottom of the noseband The noseband is the portion of a halter that slips around a horses nose  Call your horse as you approach him This helps alert your horse to your presence This way hes less likely to get spooked by your approach Call out his name or call out something like Im coming in to let him know youre entering his pasture or stall Make sure you have your halter in your left hand as you approach You will be haltering the horse from the left side You want to make sure your horse knows whats happening If you try to deceive the horse by hiding the halter hell learn to be distrustful of your intent This can lead to a bad relationship between you and the horse When haltering a horse you should always approach from the left side Halters are designed to be buckled on the left You should approach your horse so youre standing near his head on the left side of his body You do not want to put the halter on instantly This can startle your horse When you are a foot or so away from your horses head allow him to sniff your hand This way your horse will also familiarize himself with your scent Hell be able to differentiate your smell from the smell of potential predators in other situations down the roadA nervous horse may benefit from having treats as a reward for staying calm   A halter needs to be slipped over your horses head in a specific manner Once youve reached the horse position the halter in the same direction as the horses head The noseband of the halter should be facing the same direction as the horse is facing Once your halter is in the right position loop the lead rope towards the bottom of the horses neck This will provide you some control if your horse gets impatient during the haltering process and tries to run away From here gently guide the halter over the horses nose Slip the horses nose through the nose band Then slip your right hand under the horses throat Use your right hand to place the crown piece behind his ears gently bending his ears back as needed Adjust the halter as necessary to make sure its straight and not cutting into the horses ears Once the halter is on buckle up or snap up the crown piece Hold the halter in place with your left hand Use your right hand to buckle the end of the crown piece into the buckle on the left side of your horses headCheck to make sure the halter is not too tight It should be tight enough that the horse cannot slip out of it However it should also be loose enough that the straps are not digging into the horses skin If its too tight or too loose you may need to use a different sized halter next time Your horse may be nervous about being haltered Reassure your horse as you go Talk to him in a soothing voice and pet him if he seems agitated or upset   You want to make sure you have the right sized halter An illfitting halter can cause your horse pain If the halter is cutting into the horses skin or fur you could resize the crown piece by adjusting the buckles However some halters may simply be too small for your horse Go to a local tack shop and get a bigger halter if moving to the next notch on the buckle does not helpYou can measure a horses head to find the right size halter Use a measuring tape and place it midway between your horses cheekbones and nostrils Stretch the tape to the same point on the other side of your horses head Write down this measurement This is the size noseband you need If your horse reacts poorly to a measuring tape wrap string around his nose and then measure the strings length afterwardsPlace the end of the measuring tape directly under a horses cheekbone Stretch the tape to the cheekbone on the other side of his face This measurement indicates how big of a crown piece youll need Then place the tape several inches behind the horses eye and stretch it near the top of his throat Then move the tape underneath this throat to the top of his throat on the other side of his face This measurement shows you how big the halters throatlatch should be As with the noseband you can use string if your horse dislikes the feel of a measuring tapeIf you have a horse with special needs sizewise you may need a particular type of halter Draft horses need halters specifically made for larger breeds If your horse has a narrow head you may have to do some trial and error Try halters from a variety of manufacturers until you find a halter that fits There are some basic safety guidelines you should practice when haltering your horse You want to make sure your horse is safe during the haltering process   Never let a horse run loose with his halter still in place Halters can catch on tree branches and fences causing injury Leather halters can easily become damp and gather mildew This can cause them to slip off your horse easily Clean them regularly and store them in a clean dry place when not in use Never tie or wrap a lead line around a horses head If a horse gets startled or upset this could cause injury   It can be difficult to halter break an adult horse Therefore if possible start halter breaking the horse as soon as he is born   Foals should be handled by adults right away You want horses used to a human touch as young as possible Try placing a halter on a foal within his first few days of lifePlace the haler on and off your foal each day as he grows up He will begin to accept the halter as a normal part of life Later he will easily go along with being haltered as an adult If you have an adult horse who is not halterbroken youll have to start slow To begin handle your horses head ears and neck Each day interact with the horse Pet his neck ears and headReward the horse for allowing you to touch him Offer treats like carrots or apples if he remains calm when youre petting himTalk gently to your horse as you go Provide soothing words to prevent the horse from getting nervous or upset   Once the horse is comfortable with your touch introduce him to the halter For a few days simply hold the halter as you pet him Allow him to sniff the halter and get used to its presence and scent Then try gently slipping the halter over his nose and earsIt may take multiple tries If a horse gets antsy with the halter over his nose take the halter off You can try again the next dayIt may be a few days before you get the halter on the horse and buckled properly This is normal Its important to have patience and let the horse work at a pace that does not frighten him If your horse develops an aversion to the halter halter breaking will be even more difficult Once the horse is used to the halter youll need to practice leading Attach a lead rope to the halter and begin your practice sessions   During the first few sessions stand to the right of the horse Pull on the lead rope applying pressure to encourage the horse to move When your horse turns his head towards you praise him Reinforce the good behavior with treats Give him a slice of apple for example when he turns his headYou can teach your horse to step forwards by pulling on the halter until he moves Stop applying pressure once your horse takes a step forward Then pull back on the halter When your horse steps backwards stop applying pressure Consider rewarding your horse with food for good behaviorWork your way up As your horse gets used to moving forward and backward try to get him to walk with you Do a little bit each day For example start with five steps In a few days increase this to ten steps Keep going until your horse is comfortable walking with you when wearing the halter You want halter breaking to be a pleasant experience Any negative associations with the halter can set you back greatly when it comes to halter breaking Avoid punishing your horse during the process   Do not yell at your horse whip him or behave in an aggressive manner The halter is new and unfamiliar and your horse may be scared Have patience If your horse acts up take a break and try againEach lesson should end on a successful note Even if all you manage to do is get the halter over the horses nose this is still a victory If you sense your horse getting tense or uncomfortable stop

When first trying to pick up your guinea pig you need to gain his trust Start by allowing your guinea pig to sniff your hand and fingers before you touch him Use treats as incentive for your guinea pig to get closer to you and like youTreats can include small pieces of fruit like oranges plums berries grapes bananas watermelon or cantaloupe Treats can also include small pieces of vegetables like basil leaves turnip greens bell peppers romaine lettuce clover cilantro cucumber tomatoes celery corn dandelions kale and chard The following food can be fed to your guinea pig as a treat but no more than two times a week parsley carrots and apples   The best way to allow a guinea pig to build a bond with you is to hold him as often as you can At a minimum you should hold your guinea pig at least once a day Guinea pigs unlike hamsters and gerbils donât usually bite when theyâre scared Instead a guinea pig will squirm and struggle in your hands hoping youâll drop him or put him downIf your guinea pig struggles while youâre holding him be careful not to squeeze him in an attempt to stop the squirming If your guinea pig decides he wants to bite you make sure your place your hands where he cannot reach them   When you move to put your guinea pig back onto the floor or into his cage be aware that he may attempt to jump out of your hands As jumping out of your hands could injure your guinea pig a trick you may want to employ is to put your guinea pig down backwardsIf your guinea pig canât see where heâs going he will be less likely to jump out of your hands   When attempting to put your guinea pig back into his cage do not release him from your hands until he stops squirming Hold your guinea pig firmly but gently a few inches off the ground or floor of the cage and wait until he stops squirming Once your guinea pig stops squirming place his feet on the floor of his cage Do not release him from your hands until he stops squirming Even a guinea pig who likes to be held may eventually want to be put down For example your guinea pig may need to pee and want to go back into his cage If your guinea pig starts to struggle and lick your hand he may want to be put downIf your guinea pig starts to lick your hand but then settles down again he may be okay But if he continues to lick your hand and struggle you should probably put him back in his cage On average a guinea pig may only want to be held for 1020 minutes at a time If you hold your guinea pig for too long it is possible heâll pee or poop on you You may want to hold your guinea pig on your lap on top of a towel in case of an accident
The next time the person your crush likes walks into the room watch his eyes without being too obvious Does he look at her like heâs in a trance with his pupils getting big like heâs getting excited for a big date Does he look at her look away and try to slyly catch another glimpse of her again If this is the case then chances are that he may really like the other girl   When youâre in a group setting try to see how many times he looks at her compared to how many times he looks at other girls without staring at him too much Watch his eyes when heâs talking to his potential crush Does he stare into her eyes and look down and look back at her or do his eyes keep darting around the room like heâs looking for something better to do If heâs giving her all of his focus then itâs more likely he likes her  Think about it If the person you think your crush may like is around whether itâs at a party or at the mall is he much more likely to hang out too Does he tend to stay in if the person you think he likes is busy or out of town If so then it may be because your crush only want to be around if the person he likes is there too   You can even test this out by asking your crush if heâs going to soandsoâs party If he seems hesitant but then you casually mention that his potential crush will be there and he lights up then this may mean that he likes her   If youâre in a group situation involving both your crush and the person he may like and they always just kind of end up next to each other then your crush may really like that person See if he sidles up to her walks by her side or just always finds a way to strategically make it over to where she is If this is the case then heâs probably gravitating toward her because he likes her   Of course donât forget the possibility that these two may just be really good friends To know the difference look at their body language when theyâre together Do they seem excited and nervous and concerned about how they look If so then they may like each other But if theyâre totally relaxed and seem not too selfconscious then they may just be friends Make sure that itâs your crush seeking out the person you think he likes and not the other way around   If your crush likes his potential crush then youâll see him trying to improve his appearance in her presence Heâll be puffing up his chest running his hands through his hair adjusting his collar smoothing out his shirts and taking extra care with the way he looks If he even looks in a mirror or a window to gauge his appearance before talking to his potential crush then itâs likely that he likes her   He may also try to straighten his coat or inspect his clothes for stains All of this means that heâs a bit nervous and wants to make the best possible impression   Watch your crush when he talks to his potential crush to see if heâs always looking for ways to get closer to her whether itâs to take a step toward her sit so close across from her that their knees are touching or to pull a thread off of her shoulder If he even gently shoves her or pushes her then this may be his way of flirting because he really likes her   Watch his body language Does he turn his chest and shoulders in her direction or away from her If he turns his body toward her then he may have a crush See if heâs always trying to make physical contact whether itâs to touch her earring or bracelet or to tap her shoulder   If your crush really likes his potential crush then heâll be looking for opportunities to look good in front of her If you find him trying to show off whenever sheâs around then this may mean that he really does have romantic feelings for her This could mean telling loud bombastic stories pulling stunts like cannonballing into a swimming pool wearing his best clothes or showing off his dance moves juggling skills ability to speak perfect French or just going out of his way to stand out for her   When his potential crush leaves see if he takes his personality down a notch If he suddenly tries less hard when sheâs gone itâs a sign that he really does like her Pay attention to how much he cares for his appearance when sheâs there and when sheâs not If it always looks like he put twice as much time into his hair when she comes around then thatâs telling you something   If your crush mentions the person you think he might like about ten times in the course of a fiveminute conversation then itâs likely that he has a crush on her If he keeps mentioning things she said finding tenuous ways to connect her to almost every topic or even keeps talking about a conversation he had with her then yeah thereâs a good chance heâs crushing on her   Think about it youâre probably looking for every excuse to talk about your crush too arenât you Itâs likely he would do the same See if he keeps mentioning what his potential crush thinks about certain topics If he keeps saying âSarah thinks thatââ or âSarah saysââ every other sentence then he may value her opinion so much because he has a big crush on her   Of course itâs also possible that your crush wonât mention his potential crush or bring her up very much at all He may be so smitten that he can barely bring himself to say her name However you should look at his face or see what he says if someone else does bring up his potential crush if he starts stammering a lot looks nervous turns beet red or avoids the topic then he may have a crush on her too   You can always test this out by mentioning his potential crushâs name in passing and seeing how he reacts Just make sure youâre not being too obvious about it though   Observe your crush when his potential crush comes up If he suddenly gets all flustered starts tripping over his words or even forgets what he was going to say as soon as his potential crush starts talking to him then this may be a sign that he really likes her See if he doesnât sound like himself tries extra hard to be impressive or just generally seems overwhelmed by her presence if he does then this is a sign that he may in fact have a crush   Of course he may be able to talk to his crush without freaking out But if he seems too cool or completely comfortable then they may just be friends after all   If your crush laughs at everything his potential crush says even if it really isnât all that funny then this may be because he just likes her so much that heâs inclined to think everything she says is funny Laughter is also a way to release some nervous energy so if heâs always laughing in her presence it may also be because he likes her so much that it makes him nervous   Notice how much your crush laughs when he talks to other people Unless his potential crush is truly hilarious if you notice that he isnât nearly as responsive with others then it really may be because he has a crush   Another thing you may find is that your potential crush is extra guarded around the person that he likes He may seem more reserved more quiet or less likely to tell his usual corny jokes when heâs around the person he likes This may be because heâs really concerned about making a great impression and that heâs less likely to fully be himself If he seems to think before he speaks a bit more around his potential crush and to be more careful when he does talk then this may be a sign that he really likes her   He may even try to act more tough or more capable when heâs around her While he may complain to you about his fight with his brother or his poor test grades he may try to seem more perfect around the person he likes Of course if your crush really likes his potential crush and actually gets to know her pretty well then he may even begin opening up to her even more than he would to anyone else But when they first talk to each other itâs more likely that heâll be more guarded than he would be around people he doesnât like romantically   It can be hard to pinpoint exactly what âchemistryâ means but it basically means a palpable feeling of energy and sexual tension thatâs in the air when your crush is talking to the other person he likes If they seem nervous excited giggly or just not quite themselves when they talk to each other then you may be seeing some chemistry in action   See if your crush stumbles acts more silly or just seems much more excited to talk to his potential crush than he is to talk to anyone else Sometimes it can be hard to pick up on the fact that the âchemistryâ youâre seeing is only coming from one side of the equation Make sure that itâs not just the person your crush may potentially likes who is showing the signals   Check out your crushâs Facebook page Twitter account or other social media sites to see how often he interacts with his potential crush If you find that heâs commenting on or liking her pictures a lot posting links on her wall to impress her or interacting mostly with her while ignoring all of his other friends then thereâs a chance that he really does have a crush on her Of course he may be more subtle and may not interact with the girl he likes very much online but you do have a chance of finding evidence that he likes his potential crush on social media   See if he likes or comments on her photos right after she posts them This can be a sign that heâs spending a lot of time on her profile   Another way to find out whether your crush likes someone else is to ask his friends what they think Though this can be pretty risky because itâs likely that your question will get right back to your crush if you really want to know but donât want to ask him then this can be one approach to take His friends may know the truth and thereâs a small chance they can even tell you whatâs really going on so if you feel like youâre out of options this can be something to try   Just know that as soon as you ask his friends who he likes theyâll think that you have a crush on himâand theyâd be right   Your friends may see something that you donât quite see because they have an outsiderâs perspective on the situation They may be able to tell you that itâs obvious that your crush does like the other girl or they may tell you that itâs clear that those two are only friends and that youâre being paranoid Tell your friends to be honest with you and make it clear that they wonât be hurting your feelings by revealing the truth   If your friends donât know that you like your crush try to be casual about it when you ask them Though chances are that they do know alreadyâjust make sure that they donât spill the beans   If youâre really feeling bold and even know or are friends with the person whom you think your crush likes then you can consider asking her what the situation is You can try to be sneaky about it or even be honest and ask her if thereâs something going on between her and your crush if there is then you donât want to interfere with it She may tell you the truth or she may say nothingâs going on when it is try to read her expressions and body language to get the real picture   If you donât really know or trust this person however you may not want to ask her yourself See if you can find someone who knows her better to do some digging for you   If you really want to get some answers then talk to your crush yourself You donât have to reveal that you like him and all you have to do is casually ask whether or not he has a crush on so and so If he says no and sounds like he means it then you can try to pursue him If he says no but seems super defensive or weirded out then thereâs a chance heâs not telling the truth If he reveals that he does have a crush on someone else try not to look so upset and get ready to move on   If you find out that your crush really does like someone else donât be so hard on yourself It has nothing to do with you people canât help who they like Youâll be able to find someone who appreciates how amazing you are before you know it
One of the most effective ways to help you get over your crush is by distancing yourself from them Minimize any contact or the potential for contact so that you can get over them without having any lingering ties that could upset you or reinforce your feelings for themDistancing yourself will be hard at first but itâs ultimately for the better and will make the process of getting over them easier and faster  One way to assure that you wonât have any contact with your crush is to delete his contact information from your phone Also consider erasing any text messages from them that you may have Deleting this information will not only keep you from contacting them in a moment of weakness but wonât be an everpresent reminder of them eitherIf youâre reluctant to delete their information entirely consider writing it on a piece of paper that you wonât see every day and store it in a safe place Email copies of their text messages and then archive them if you arenât ready to completely delete them Remember that even if you delete your contact they may not delete you If they contacts you you can either not respond or choose to send a brief polite response The large number of social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram means increased accessibility to people even those with whom you donât necessarily want to be in contact By removing your crushâs presence from your social media accounts you can further limit the amount of contact you have with themIf youâre concerned that you might hurt your crush or leave others questioning your motives by unfollowing or defriending them on social media sites find a way to minimize what you see on these apps For example on Facebook you can simply unsubscribe from their posts which will make sure that you donât get status updates Itâs natural when you have a crush on someone to talk about them and to think about them a lot but this will only reinforce your feelings Consciously not mentioning them in conversations and actively shifting your thoughts when you do think about them will help you get over them more quicklyIt may be difficult to not mention them in conversations especially if you have mutual friends so try to not talk about them or ask how they are too often You can also step away from conversations about them If you need to talk about them to process your thoughts and feelings do so but donât make it a regular habit If your friends know that you have feelings for your crush they may occasionally mention them This will only remind you of them and may hinder your ability to get over them so ask your friends to not bring them up or update you if possibleThere will likely be situations especially in groups with mutual friends where your crushâs name is brought up In order get over them more quickly step away from these groups until theyâve moved on to a new topic of conversation   You and your crush may have many things in common including friends classes or workplaces or favorite places Avoid situations where you run the risk of seeing them   If you take classes together or work in the same place donât sit near them If they sit next to you you can also find a way to relocate or decide to keep it cordial Also do not engage in eye contact with themThen it could make things awkward or spark a unwanted conversation If you like the same restaurants for example try out new places to eat   Getting rid of any reminders of them that you may have will help you get over your crush Youâll want to remove traces of them from everything from your phone and social media to photographs and other mementos in your homeYou can either take a gradual or coldturkey approach to removing them from your life It might be emotionally easier for you to remove reminders of them bit by bit or you can also get rid of traces of them all at once Doing this at all once will be very difficult but can speed up the process of getting over your crush Delete emails or get rid of letters cards or presents from your crush Holding on to these things make you hold on to your feelings for themDelete any photos of them or the two of you together Getting over your crush is a painful process and itâs completely

Meeting his eyes and smiling across a room wont work on a guy who feels uncomfortable with eye contact and doesnt usually notice subtle smiles   However hell probably pay extra attention to your face since he has a crush on you and spend extra energy analyzing your expressions This means that hell be more likely to pick up on subtle cues but he may misinterpret them also  For example a neurotypical guy might pick up that Theres this really cute guy I like might mean him but an autistic guy is less likely to realize that you arent talking about someone else Try to avoid signals that could be misinterpreted   You dont have to walk up to him and flatout announce I like you Instead use the more obvious flirting tactics in your repertoire and clearly communicate through your words and body language that youre interested Remember not everyone likes to be touched Its fine to err on the side of forwardness Many autistic people are sincere and straightforward and they enjoy it when people are clear about what they want   Many autistic people love to talk about their special interests and are happy to teach you or discuss back and forth If you let him know that youre interested hell stay interested   One of the positive traits of some autistic people is a heightened sense of social responsibility or the desire to help others and fix problems Open up to him and allow him to help you navigate your problems It will bring you closer together   Expect him to get excited and probably admit he likes you too If he gets flustered dont worry he just needs time to put into words what he wants to say   There is a slight chance that hell panic or overreact If so its probably because he doesnt know what to do not that he doesnt like you Give him time   Autistic people often have trouble initiating conversations Instead of gauging his interest by how much he initiates consider how much he reciprocates If hes happy when you ask him out that means hes definitely into you   Autistic people are an incredibly diverse group just like nonautistic people and popular perceptions often arent particularly accurate Get to know him as an individual and dont rely on stereotypes   Mixed signals are confusing in general but even more so for autistic people If you have a schedule conflict tell him its a schedule conflict and ask to reschedule the date If youre upset tell him that youre upset and why This will help him respond to you better   That is the greatest gift you can give an autistic person
If you want to have a knockout conversation with the girl then you have to start strong When you see the girl you want to talk to whether its a girl youve been crushing on for a while or a cute girl you just spotted at a party you should let her notice you for a few minutes Let her see you have fun with your friends and not paying too much attention to her Then when you lock eyes stride over to her with confidence Keep your head up high and look straight ahead   If you dont know her then introduce yourself Just say Hey Im Brian Whats your name This is simple but effective If you do know the girl just say Hi How are you or What have you been up to You dont have to be too elaborate here  you just want to walk up to her like its no big deal Fake it until you make it  even if youre terrified of talking to girls just pretend like its no big deal  Theres no need to prepare an elaborate joke or a pickup line or to do a backflip to get the girls attention Just say something that will make the girl want to talk to you more and to get to know you a bit This is not the time to discuss your grandmothers funeral or to talk about your goals for the future Just talk to her about something you saw on TV about something your dog did or about something cool that you did over the weekend Dont put too much pressure on yourself and start with a light opening line Try something like this   Man my weekend was crazy I had to help my dad build an addition to the house and I can barely move my arms How about you Did you do something more exciting with your time Look at this scratch on my hand My cat is nuts when hes hungry How about you  do you have any pets Can you believe how hard that math test was Im pretty sure I got every question wrong How about you   As you start talking to the girl you should get a sense of what she wants from you Every girl is different If shes more shy then shell need you to draw her out ask more questions and to do more of the talking But if shes really chatty and outgoing then you should let her speak and not worry so much about impressing her and avoid interrupting her as well Once you know the kind of girl she is then you can adjust your conversation accordingly   Dont worry if shes shy She may be one of those girls who is only shy at first but who quickly opens up once you make her comfortable Though its important to be yourself you should stick to safe topics when you first talk to the girl before you know whether she has a sick sense of humor or if shes easily offended by inappropriate jokes or comments The more you talk to her the more youll know what you can and cant say around her Even if the girl is outgoing you shouldnt let her do all of the talking Let her know that you can hang with her   Theres nothing small about small talk If youre talking to a girl you cant start off with your deepest most important desires or shell want to run away Small talk is an art and you can master it just by mentioning mundane topics that lead you to a more intimate exciting conversation You have to start small to end big so dont be afraid to mention the most basic things even the weather or your upcoming chemistry test Here are some examples of how you can make small talk turn to a more deep topic   Can you believe how much it rained this weekend I was supposed to go biking with my dad but we ended up staying in the house all weekend Did you do anything fun in the rain or were you cooped up too I meant to study for tomorrows chem test last night but my little sister was sick with a cold and I had to help my mom take care of her How about you  do you have any siblings I saw The Avengers last night I thought it was okay but not my favorite Whats your favorite movie   After youve talked to the girl for a little while you can let her know youre interested without coming on too strong or scaring her off You can even joke around with her a bit and compliment her by teasing her Just one compliment will do for now  you dont want her to feel like youre stalking her or obsessing over how great she is Here are some ways to do it   I like the color of your shirt It really matches your eyes Did you do that on purpose You have a great laugh You should use it more often Youre the only girl Ive ever met who knows more about baseball than I do How did that happen   Once youve been chatting with the girl for a while you can start to ask her some questions that show that her interests and opinion matters to you without prying too much She shouldnt feel like shes in an interrogation room but she should feel like youre genuinely making the effort to get to know her instead of just showing off or trying to impress her without caring who she really is Here are some questions that you can ask questions while revealing something about yourself to make the girl feel more comfortable   When I get home from school I always pick up my guitar first What do you do for fun when youre not in school Do you like being on the tennis team I think being on the soccer team is okay  when our coaching isnt killing us with drills I see you hanging out with Sarah a lot Is she your best friend or are you one of those girls with a bunch of best friends   If you want to keep the girl hooked then you have to make her laugh so she feels comfortable and wants to keep talking to you To make her laugh you can poke fun at yourself tease her a bit or tell her a funny thing that happened to you over the weekend Dont be too obvious about trying to be funny or telling her jokes and dont try to make her laugh just by putting people down Here are some things you can say to try to make her laugh   Ive been playing my guitar so much that I think Im becoming obsessed Last night I had a dream that I was Jimi Hendrix  man was I bummed when I woke up Is everything in your wardrobe pink or are you just wearing all of your pink clothes at once Yesterday I told coach I had a cold so I could skip practice But then he saw me hanging out at Sonic later that day  man was I busted   Even if the girl is more on the shy side you should still let her talk and tell you what shes thinking or what she cares about You may be so nervous about running out of things to say that you find yourself rambling on about seemingly nothing and not coming up for air Make sure to pause between your sentences let the girl make interjections and dont interrupt her if she tries to talk   If shes in the middle of telling her a story dont just wait for her to finish so you can tell her a story that you think is similar but better  this will make her feel like youre not really listening React to what shes saying You dont have to nod along or say Yeah every two seconds to let her know you care about what she has to say Just make eye contact nod at the right times and make appropriate comments like Thats crazy I cant believe you had to do that or I had no idea that   If youre bragging or showing off then the girl will want to run for the hills before you finish listing all of your accomplishments in the world of high school basketball Telling the girl what a great athlete or student you are wont impress her and will in fact have the opposite effect and will make her think youre shallow or narcissistic   You can talk about how much you like the sport you play without telling her how great you are at it You can mention your favorite class without saying that you got an A on the last paper Dont think that the girl wont know how awesome you are if you dont brag Instead shell think youre awesome because youre being humble   This is different from bragging You can make the girl see what makes you different from all of the other guys without bragging about it Instead let her know a bit about your quirks or interests without making her think that youre a little weird right away This may not be the time to tell her about your spider collection but you can talk about how much you like volunteering at the local soup kitchen taking your dog for walks or writing songs   Find a way of bringing up one of the things you like to do that really represents who you are and wait for the girl to ask for more questions After you tell her something about yourself ask her something about herself so she doesnt feel like youre dominating the conversation   If you really want to keep the girls interest then you have to play it cool striking the balance between letting her see that you like talking to her without getting puppydog eyes or practically drooling at her feet To play it cool you shouldnt crowd her too much when youre talking to her compliment her a million times or tell her how beautiful or amazing she is   You should act like you like talking to her but that you have lots of experience talking to girls so if she doesnt like you youll survive Think before you speak If youre dying to give her a compliment find a way to make it sound less intense first For example if youre dying to say You have the most beautiful hair in the world you can say I like the way your hair catches the light Ive never seen that before   There are two scenarios for when its best to stop talking to the girl One is that shes just not that into you and is looking at her feet her phone or desperately glancing at her friends to save her The other is when youre having an amazing time talking to her and can tell shes really into the conversation  though it may seem unnatural you should leave the girl at the peak of the conversation if youre not being rude so she wants to talk to you next time   If the girl doesnt like talking to you just give her a kind goodbye and leave Theres no reason to make it worse by saying I guess you think Im annoying If you can tell that she does really like talking to you and youre having a great time then its time to prepare to make an exit   You shouldnt pull every trick out of your sleeve tell the girl every little thing that makes you interesting and ask her every possible question that will fascinate her all at once That will leave you with little to talk about the next time you see her Instead find a way to tease the conversation so she wants to hear what you have to say and to keep talking the next time youre around Here are some ways to do it   Did I tell you about the time I met Dave Matthews at a Burger King Oh man Ill have to save that one for another day Acting sounds so fun I want to hear all about how youre getting into the role of Lady Macbeth next time Macbeth is like my favorite Shakespeare play Eddie and I are going to try surfing for the first time tomorrow Its supposed to be really windy so Ill let you know if we survive   You dont have to tell the girl that you just had the time of your life talking to her  even if you did Just one short sentence that lets her know that you had a great conversation will make her feel special and will make her want to talk to you again Here are some ways to do it   Its been fun catching up I cant believe what you told me about your sister I love talking to you about music I always walk away with a new recommendation Looks like I lost track of time because I like talking about movies so much   The conversation doesnt have to end there Right before you say goodbye say something that lets her know that youre looking forward to talking again even if you wont get to see her for a little while This will make her feel special without feeling like shes being stalked Here are some things you can say   Good luck with that swim meet tomorrow Youll have to tell me all about it soon Ill see you in Math tomorrow Please come prepared with a joke because Ill need a good laugh after we get those tests back I love hearing your stories about your family Maybe Ill get to hear more at Beckys party this weekend   Once youve closed down the conversation let the girl know that you like talking to her and mentioned a time when youll potentially see each other again you have nothing left to do but to smile lift up a hand say See you later and then walk off into the sunset Make your exit confidently and quickly instead of lingering around until you run out of things to talk about or keep shifting feet   Dont try too hard at the end Just a simple Ill talk to you later will get the point across If you have a place to go like English class or batting practice tell her where youre going so she sees that youre busy and have a lot going on Give the girl a big smile when you leave to make her comfortable It doesnt have to be an intense overthetop smile Just smile enough to let her see that youve had a good time
Just ask one of his friends if hes single  Engage in a conversation It doesnt matter whether if youre a teen or an adult always become friends first   Do things that make you feel good about yourself and wear things you like Confidence is always a good thing and generally boys like independent confident girls   This is like asking him out except in a friendly way Remember to become friends before asking   If he sits in the closest seat to you for a few days he likes you When he comes on the next day come invite him to sit with you and maybe listen to music As he is close ask him if you want to do something later tonight if he says yes congrats If he says no say ok maybe some other time   But be careful he might be looking at another girl thats sitting near you
If you feel like she genuinely wants to know how you feel you may want to have this conversation somewhere quiet Think about going to a place where you can talk uninterrupted You want to have this conversation in a space where you are comfortable to talk about how you feel openly    This can be a great opportunity to show her how cool you are regardless of why she is asking If you can tell her how you feel and remain cool calm and collected she will respect you all the more Going on a walk can be a good option for a conversation like this Walking can take away some of the awkwardness involved in the conversation Walking is great because you are moving not sitting and looking at each other Going to a restaurant or coffee shop can also work if it is not busy If you can find a secluded table to sit at or a table outside this can be ideal Go to a park Sit on the swings or find a bench where the two of you can talk   In order to show her that you respect her space and boundaries ask her to decide where you should go If she does not have a preference then you can suggest places to go    Be careful not to try to force her to feel the same way Say that you like her in a way that is free of further implication Free of implication means that you are not communicating a different message through your body language or tone  For example do not look very intently at her in a way that asks her to like you back Or do not lean forward into her space unless you know that she likes you You could ask her how she feels before you say anything However it is more attractive and confident if you own how you feel and speak first   She has asked you about your crush on her and you can absolutely ask why she wants to know Simply ask âwhy are you askingâ Do not assume that you know why she is asking   Once again keep your tone and body language free of implication Do not suggest that you know why she is asking with a flirty or accusing tone Focus fully on what she is saying Show interest nod smile and communicate that you understand through your body language and noises Try not to interrupt her Let her speak her piece You can ask for clarification later Give her feedback about what she said You can say so what I hear you say is  This will let her know that you really listened and that you want to understand her Do not be judgmental about what she is saying This is how she feels and although it may involve you do not take her feelings personally Read on to the next method for more on not taking it personally   If she likes you back you can tell her âIâm so excited that you like me tooâ If she does not like you back you can tell her honestly âIâm sad that you do not like me but I appreciate that you told meâ   You can also thank her for being brave enough to bring up the conversation If she does not like you do not make her feel bad for not liking you Even if you honestly feel like she should like you it is not your place to tell her that or make her feel that way   If she doesnât feel the same way you might want to ask her if she still wants to be friends If you do not feel like you two can be friends ask if you can have space If she does like you ask her whether she would like to start dating   Try not to assume what will happen between you two if she says she has a crush on you too Instead communicate with her how she feels about dating If you want to start dating ask her about what dating means to her and explain what dating means to you You want to make sure that you are talking about the same thing You may also want to discuss relationship expectations you have and ask her about hers This may be a full conversation in itself and one you come back to periodically   Because it can be an awkward conversation you may want to avoid talking about it However embrace the awkwardness and be confident If you are still friends but she does not like you you can simply tell her âthanks for having that conversation with me I appreciated itâ   You can also follow up over text message but keep it brief Do not try to change her mind instead acknowledge the conversation and then move on
If you arenât sure if he likes you or not trying to become friends first may be the way you want to go Get to know him a bit spend time with him and find some common ground Ask him about his hobbies or how he likes to spend his time and open up a bit Keep it casual Find common interests If there are activities you both enjoy youâll have more reasons to spend time with him Ask him what kind of music he likes to see if he has similar interests You can even talk about classes you have together Spend time with his friends This may help you learn more about him   If you have a crush on this boy and are trying to be friends first be careful not to come on too strong As you get to know him better reveal some more personal information about yourself However if he isnât also telling you about himself you may want to stay more remote instead of opening up Dont spill your soul   Have inside jokes and secrets with him This is a great way to open up to each other and can help you gauge his sense of humor Having inside jokes allows you to establish common ground and can strengthen your friendship Ask him if he has a crush After youâve gotten to know each other and share a certain level of trust you may feel comfortable enough to ask him if he has a crush This can move the relationship forward if heâs interested in you Be sure to ask at a time when it flows naturally do not force it into an unrelated conversation If he isnât interested donât be visibly upset Put your best foot forward you can still be friends and his feelings about you may change over time   As you become friends and spend more time together let your confidence show If you try too hard to be someone youre not he wont get to know the real you Dont be afraid to be yourself Heâll be impressed by how cool understanding and fun you are
Often you will start to fall out of this stage of infatuation once you have gone through all of the possibilities of planning a life together and notice the reality of the situation For example you know that you want kids and the other person does not want kids Maybe you thought that you could work through this but as time goes on you start to see how much more important this is to you than you thought   The things you realize about the person after the infatuation period is over are not always incompatible with who you are or your life For example you may realize that even though at first you didnt think that her family living in Hawaii would be a challenge that it is a real challenge However the challenge is worth it to you   Once you have enough data to know whether or not the person you are infatuated with really loves you or does not love you you will begin to leave the infatuation stage Over time even the most infatuated person will start to pick up on the patterns that they are going through with loveunrequited love This accumulated experience will help the infatuation period come to an end   If you have spent a lot of time together had enough talks and done enough things together that you finally feel like you really know himher you will likely be coming to the end of your infatuation Based on what you see does this person seem like a person who would be well suited for you and who you would be good for   After infatuation couples can successfully transition into long term loving and committed relationships However the opposite is also possible It is possible that you were with someone who was not right for you in the long run but you were unable to see that because of your feelings of infatuation   Does this person share the same interests goals values and lifestyle that you do Does this person bring out the good side in you Or was the relationship all about the chemistry that you shared   Based on your knowledge decide whether this relationship is a good choice for your life If you decide that you want to be with this person move forward and work to build communication compassion and work into your relationship so that it lasts If you decide that this relationship is not right for you you should break up   Infatuation lasts between 18 months and three years typically Infatuation does not generally last longer than that unless it is prolonged by a longdistance relationship or deep insecurity in the person who is infatuated Off againon again relationships can also cause the infatuation period to go on for a longer time
He will hopefully notice you and start wondering why you do thatÂ   He should start returning that soon afterÂ    If he catches you smile cutely and look away not as fast Do this around his friends and hope they notice and pick up the situation and maybe hint about you liking himÂ    If you sit with friends in that particular space and eat or relax it wont look as obviousÂ    Eventually you can move onto other topics Make sarcastic comments and jokes where appropriate Â    If it wasnt very funny put your hand on his and say sarcastically Hilarious while rolling your eyesÂ    If you think he may be looking at you abruptly turn your head to something away from him then look back at him quickly If he is watching you he should look at whatever distracted you subconsciouslyÂ    If his friends tease him when you are around then there is a very good chance he likes you backÂ    Boys are generally the ones expected to ask out girls so he may feel flattered and relieved and then accept or he may decline If he does decline nod and smile and say Thats okay Ill ask somebody else if they want to come then walk away calmly Do NOT hold this against him but instead continue to be nice to him Show him that you dont mind the rejection even if you do Do not shy away from him but continue to pursue him subtlyÂ    Speak your mind on topics that come up during conversation with him Dont hold back on saying what you think is right and just but dont overdo it and accidentally offend himÂ    If you are athletic get into a sport he is involved with If you are smart join a debating team or do something that he is involved with academically But dont change the person you are just to get him to notice you If he doesnt notice you after a few major hints like actually asking him out or if he acts snobbish around you forget him he just isnt worth your timeÂ    Smiling means confidence and boys like girls with selfesteem as it makes talking less awkward and more communicativeÂ    Add to this by saying thanks but dont try to deny what he says it will lower his selfesteem and make things awkward between you Graciously accept the comment and perhaps make one of your ownÂ    Dont push too hard for information though you dont want to come off as a stalkerÂ    If he walks up to you dont be afraid to talk Ask him how his day has been and what class he has next Hopefully he will return this and you will move onto another topicÂ    Everybody tells you to do this but reality is not everybody does If you lie about who you are and what you do and dont like then chances are you have ruined the relationship before it has begun He will like you for that person you say you are instead of who you really are When he finds out things WILL get awkward so its best to be honest from the start And then if it turns out he doesnt like you then he just isnt worth itÂ
Once you do this sit with the group for a bit to see how your guy acts If he seems to be putting on a show for his friends it is likely that he is trying to get your attention This means that heâs interested If he seems quiet or awkward he might be uncomfortable with the situation because heâs not interested in you and doesnât feel comfortable with you hanging around his friends   Take note of how often and the reasons he calls or texts you when you arenât together If he is only calling you to ask a favor he probably just sees you as a friend If he calls just to see how youâre doing or to make small talk heâs interested   Is he always on is phone Does he appear scatterbrained and ready to get out of the conversation If either of these are true heâs not interested If he is interested he will give you his full attention for as long as he can get it for

When we lose something important to us the healthy response is to grieve Psychologists believe that all people generally go through the same stages of grief or the same set of emotional responses Understanding these can help you understand your feelings and know that how you feel is normal and healthy These stages last for different amounts of time for different individuals and certain stages may not present at all It is important to remember that everyone is differentDenial It may be difficult at first to believe that your relationship has ended Especially if you have been together for a long time the idea of not being together may feel unnatural and unreal You may perhaps feel that your partner isnât really gone they just need time to cool down While this is a normal emotional response it is important to acknowledge that your relationship is over as denying this will just make things harder for you and your partner Anger This is often described as a feeling of âWhy meâ You may feel the strong need to blame the end of your relationship on any number of factors You may blame yourself your partner your God your family your friends your job or any other number of factors It is important not to act out however Fault is often shared between many factors or may not exist at all Bargaining This is a time period where people often try to return to their ended relationship You may beg your partner to take you back promising to change whatever you perceive as being the source of the breakup This is likely not a good idea however Even if the relationship can be repaired it should be done after serious reflection and positive changes This stage generally ends when one realizes that the relationship cannot be repaired Depression This is usually the longest lasting stage of grief You will feel very sad and often as if there is no hope You may feel like you never want to love again or that life is pointless These emotions are normal but remember that feelings of suicide are not If you feel this way seek help immediately Like all stages of grief this stage too will end and you will be happy again Acceptance Acceptance of what has happened to you usually follows or coincides with the Depression stage You will come to understand that the end of your relationship is not the end of the world You will feel okay about what has happened and you will be ready to move on to the next stage of your life  It is important to be sad Donât pretend that everything is wonderful Bottling your emotions like this is unhealthy and can lead to problems later on You should allow yourself to be sad Cry if you want to This is a normal healthy response when bad things happen to you   Watching sad or hopeful movies eating comfort foods or getting some good snuggle time with your favorite pet is a good way to spend time being sad Of course being sad for a long time or being sad in a way that significantly impacts your quality of life may be an indication that its time to start turning your feelings around If you cant do this on your own get help   When you are at this stage it is important to have time to yourself While being with others is important and can significantly help the healing process you need time to yourself as well Use this time to take care of your own needs Focus on what makes you feel better and thinking about what you want at this stage in your life Having others around can be distracting which is good in moderation but will keep you from taking care of yourself if in excess   Set aside at least a few hours every day where you can be by yourself and really process your feelings In the evening before bedtime is usually the easiest for most people If your home is not a good environment for alone time try going on a walk in your neighborhood to a local park or to your local library   After a breakup especially if the relationship was longterm you may feel like you wasted time or that the whole thing was pointless This is never the case and it is important to keep that in mind Even bad experiences serve to teach us about ourselves what we want from life what we value most and how to better interact with other peopleThough your relationship has ended it has undoubtedly provided you with invaluable life experiences If it did not you would not feel so upset about it ending   Finding meaning in your experience can be a really powerful way to move on instantly transforming a negative experience into something that while it may not be fully positive will as least make you happy on some level that it happened at all Finding that meaning however is difficult and how you do it will depend on you how you think and what you gained from the experience Try not to look for negative life lessons since these will only make you more bitter Instead look for something that is really a gain in your life Good examples of lessons from tough experiences include Now I know that I can survive tough situations or Now I know more about what I want as a person and what is really important to me or This has made me realize how truly wonderful the people in my life are and helped me to appreciate them while I have them   Donât pretend like your ex never existed Like bottling your emotions this is an unhealthy response This person played a role in your life and that role needs to be acknowledged Know that the time with your ex is over but remembering those times fondly will help you feel better in the long term   While many people make themselves feel better by thinking about the bad things about their ex it is also important to think about the good things Focusing only on the bad things will lead you to be bitter and may lead you to regret things about your relationship that you enjoyed at the time This poisoning of your own memories will just hurt you in the long run To remind yourself of the good parts of your relationship write down the things about your ex that you liked or particularly good times you had together   Failed relationships like anything in your life that ends badly can serve as a wonderful learning opportunity Reflect on your relationship the good things and the bad things so that you can use that knowledge to bring positive change to your life This will allow you to improve future relationships by learning from your mistakes and learning more about what you want from yourself and another person   Think about your partners failures in the relationship as well as the things they did well Which of these qualities would you like to see in future relationships and what qualities should you avoid in the future Maybe your ex was very lazy which didnât bother you in the beginning but became a problem over time This might be something to avoid in your next relationship even if it isnât so much of a problem in the beginning Acknowledge your own faults There were likely things in the relationship that you handled poorly as well Think about what these things were and how these traits negatively impact your relationships with other people These can be qualities which affect friends and family as well Think about how and if you want to try to change these things about yourself Maybe you find that you forget to consider the feelings of others for example This may be a quality to change in order to create better relationships with everyone around you Love yourself Remember to think about the good things about yourself as well You are a good person even if you have made mistakes Bad experiences in life should not keep you from feeling like you have something to offer the world List the things about yourself that you and others like Focus on really making those qualities shine and you will feel better in no time
For some people staying in touch can be a nice way to keep a friend who youve got a little crush on For others it can be like torture Decide if youre likely to ever see this person in real life again or if staying in touch will only make it worse   If you cant be together and dont live in the same area consider cutting all ties Dump the phone number texts pictures and memories The quicker you forget this person the better Social media makes it pretty easy to keep in touch which can be a blessing or a curse Its easy to chat regularly and keep up to date with their life but that can be painful Consider blocking them on social media as well  Sometimes its ok to have a sad lonely night on the couch watching romantic Netflix movies Have some ice cream and get the tissues out Sometimes this is just the thing you need to mope around a bit and move on   Try to put a limit on it If this wasnt an actual relationship theres no reason to mope around for more than a day or two lamenting your lost crush Youll find someone new   Allow yourself to think about the person you liked but not for more than a certain amount of time each day Set aside 20 or 30 minutes to think about the person so that you can process your feelings of grief and start to accept the fact that your crush is gone   When the allotted time is up for the day tell yourself that you can think about the person again tomorrow and immediately start engaging in an activity that is productive such as homework or doing something fun   While you dont want to constantly dwell on the sad feelings that you have its not healthy to completely ignore them either Write down the feelings you are experiencing through poetry songwriting short stories or in a journal   You can also write letters to the crush that you dont actually intend to send Writing about your feelings or composing a nevertobesent letter to the person can help you process and release your feelings in a healthy and constructive way   While it hurts a lot getting over a crush is going to eventually happen Try not to spend too much money on chocolate and tissues Itll take time but eventually the hole in your heart will get filled Who knows maybe

new school try your best to make as many new friends as possible Consider making different kinds of friends or finding other types of kids to hang out with You might even find a good crush   Consider telling them about your situation Not only will it make you new friends but they might try to set you up with someone which would also distract you from the fact that your crush is so far away   If youve just moved youve got a great opportunity to not only get over a crush but to turn over a whole new page in your life Nobody knows about your past here Nobody knows what you used to be like You can be anybody Consider making a big style change or switching things up at your new school   Just because you never used to dye your hair purple or listen to punk rock doesnt mean that people at your new school know that They didnt see your kindergarten pictures Theyll never be the wiser   Go to that new cafe that just opened up down the street join a club get some hobbies The more things you do the more people youll meet Eventually youre bound to meet someone who catches your interest   Try to mix your life up a bit in little ways Take a different route to school each day or have something different for breakfast every day of the week Keep looking for new ways to spice it up   Its important to get plenty of sleep eat healthy and exercise any time youre feeling depressed Lack of sleep is known to affect mood and to make people more emotional while longterm sleep deprivation is commonly linked to depression Getting a good nights sleep will help you feel refreshed and give you the

crush on and your old crush will fade quickly away   If you do meet someone try not to compare them to your crush People hold their crushes in higher regard than they do other people so comparisons will fall short Each person is a unique individual so its pointless to try to find some one just like your crush
Once you have been able to strike up a conversation with this guy you can move on to actually flirting An important element of flirtation is making strong eye contact This is different from just catching his eye from across the hall When you are flirting you want to   Maintain his gaze while you are talking Keep your gaze soft Smile andor laugh   Your early conversations should be simple effortless and brief Your goal is to keep him wanting more so you should avoid giving him too much of you at once Avoid digging into heavy emotional political or stressful topics Avoid complaining or ranting Instead talk about something funny or look for things you have in common like sports fashion spring break plans   Keep early interactions short and sweet You can say I have that same notebook You can brainstorm a short funny story ahead of time For example try saying That reminds me of this time I went to San Jose When in doubt use compliments Such as âWow youâre really good at mathâ   If you are talking and feeling great it might be time to âbreak the touch barrierâ In other words you can really communicate that you like someone by using nonchalant touch You can try   Gently touching his arm while laughing Brushing against him Pretend to clean a leaf from their back Make it seem like an accident and see how they respond   Rather than waiting around for him to notice you take the plunge and ask him out If it seems like he is interested in you go ahead and make the first move Pump yourself up with a motivational song or a confidencebuilding conversation with your friend before you talk to him You might say   Hey are you busy this Saturday Maybe we could catch a movie Would you want to grab a coffee sometime Do you have a date for the dance next week

to do when you want to do them You donât need someone elseâs permission and you dont need to worry about how your actions will make someone else feel Examples of ways you can enjoy your new independence are going to see a movie your ex would not have enjoyed wearing clothes that you like but your ex found unattractive spending time with a friend your ex did not get along with as well as the sort of individual activities like reading books that are hard to find time for when you are dating   The best way to get back to life is to live your life Youre alive and the world around you is

Most horse showing competitions forbid the use of certain bits Even if you do not attend events obeying one of these lists is not a bad idea These bits are generally forbidden due to the pain they cause the horse  A simple snaffle bit is a mild popular option that only applies the amount of pressure you pullAlways begin with a snaffle and try the stronger bits only if the horse is difficult to control   You can purchase measuring tools for this purpose or you can place a wooden dowel in his mouth where the bit should sit Find a dowel that sticks out about half an inch 125 cm on either side this dowel is the appropriate width for your bit For most horses start with a 4â5 inch 10â13cm bit and switch as necessary   Usually a smaller horse has a smaller mouth and will need a smaller bit and the reverse for larger horses Their are exceptions however as some breeds have unusually large or small heads If you have access to a previous bit allow it to hang straight and measure the mouthpiece Do not include the rings in the measurement   The outside of the snaffle consists of a ring on either side of the mouth Common options include Drings Orings and loose rings which are free to rotate in place The best way to choose these is to try out several to feel the difference in control and see how your horse reacts Make your decision based on your and your horses personal preference   If you cant try out the bit before buying go with the popular Dring This tends to be less harsh than other bits   Snaffle bits come with a variety of mouthpieces as well A basic jointed mouthpiece is a good option for most riders but there are other options Here are a few factors to keep in mind   Rubber or plasticcoated mouthpieces are more mild than a bare metal bar Twisted wire mouthpieces are the most severe and should only be used by experienced trainersThinner mouthpieces are generally more likely to cut the horses mouth or cause pain   Confirm that the mouthpiece is comfortable with the following tests   Make sure the rings or metal connections at the corners of the mouth do not pinch the horses lip tissue If youre not sure put the side of your finger next to that ringbar juncture Spin the ring and see if it pinches your own finger which is harder to pinch than soft tissue The link in the middle of a broken mouth snaffle can pinch as well If you have this type of bit test this on the side of your finger as well Check whether the center of the bit hits the rugae ridges of the horses palate or the roof of the mouth This is often whats happening if the horse is restless or tosses its head a lot In this case switch to a French link mouthpiece which lays flatter on the tongue and allows a larger range of motion
Putting a saddle pad on the horses back prevents the leather from rubbing the horse Make sure the front is near the end of the withers  Make sure that your horse is secure in crossties or being held by a helper throughout the process Place the saddle directly on their back  making sure that it does not block the front shoulder or extends beyond the last rib in their ribcage   The gullet is the hollow space that runs down the top of the horseâs spine If you stand behind your horse you should be able to look down the gullet and see all the way through to the horses mane On the front side of the saddle you should be able to stack 23 fingers vertically inside the gullet   If you can only fit one finger or less in the gullet then the saddle tree is too narrow If you can fit significantly more than three fingers in the gullet then the saddle tree is probably too wide   An average horse has a topline that peaks slightly at the withers and croup with a low dip between the two The two primary problems appear if a horse is swayback has a significant dip between the withers and croup or is straightbacked has little to no dip between the withers and croup The saddle should match the angle of the topline   Bridging will occur if the saddle rests on the croup and the withers without touching the space between the two Check this on your horse as if it occurs it will cause sores on the places the saddle comes into contact Your horse will require a saddle with a larger bend in the saddle tree If your horse has a straight back this is most common in mules then the saddle will rock back and forth on their back You can rectify this by purchasing a special mule saddle that has a particularly straight saddle tree   The bars two parallel bars that run the length of the saddle giving it support flare out slightly at the front of the saddle The most common problem that arises with illfitting bars is that there is not enough flare which constricts shoulder movement and can cause sores Check to make sure that the saddle flares out from the horse a bit in the front to allow better freedom of movement If youâre ever not sure if the saddle youâre trying out doesnât fit your horse look to the horse for cues Their body language will show you if a saddle is uncomfortable or painful or if a saddle fits well and is tailored to their shape   Sit relaxed in the seat of the saddle and check the amount of space there is from the front of your seat to the swellfork of the saddle the part the horn is attached to In a wellfitting saddle you should have about 4 inches 1016 cm between the front of your body and the fork of the saddle   The cantle is the raised part similar to the back of a chair that is placed behind your seat on the saddle If your saddle fits you well you should be resting just below the rise of the cantle If the saddle is too large on you there will be more than 2 fingersâ width of space between your rear and the cantle If the saddle is too small for you you will be resting on the cantle itself   When sizing a western saddle you should be able to stand up in the stirrups and have 2 inches 508 cm to 4 inches 1016 cm between your bottom and the seat of the saddle Stirrups can be adjusted but you dont want extra leather hanging loose

final project for English due again If you end up talking a lot to your crushâs friends youâre bound to meet or hang out with your crush before long Becoming friends with your crushâs friends is a way to get into your crushâs good books Donât talk about your crush to his friends If you start asking about your crush immediately after meeting them it will be obvious that you like him Try to play it cool   If you feel nervous about approaching your crush there are several things you can do to get her attention and appear interestedMake eye contact and smile Eye contact and smiling shows that you are friendly and approachable but you have to make sure not to overdo it If your crush doesnât respond the first time donât keep doing it If youâre a girl play with your hair especially if itâs long Twirl your hair around your finger or brush it to the side Drawing attention to your hair is a way of highlighting one of your assets   If youâve never spoken to your crush before itâs time to take the plunge Find a reason to talk to your crush preferably when there arenât many people around so you wonât get interrupted If you donât know your crush talk about something relating to the circumstances that youâre inFor instance if you are waiting in line for something ask your crush Hey do you think the wait is worth it If you are in the break room at work you could say Have you tried the cookies Susan brought in Theyre really good Asking a question is a good way to start a conversation For instance if you are in the same class you could ask âHey what did Mr Feinstein say the homework was againâ You could also ask for help Whether it be opening a jar reaching for something carrying a heavy suitcase or getting help with homework asking your crush for help is a great way to start a conversation It also will make your crush feel good about himself which is a good way to have your first interaction with him be a positive one   Once you have started talking to your crush talk about anything you may have in common People are naturally attracted to people that they have things in common with so talking about shared passions is a good way to create a bondFor instance If are both on the school track team ask your crush So how are you feeling about the next track meet   Asking your crush a question shows her that you find her interesting and want to learn more about her Since people like to talk about themselves it also can be a good way to keep the conversation goingFor example ask your crush âSo how long have you been working hereâ or âWhat other classes are you taking this semesterâ   After youve asked your crush about himself you may be worrying about what you are going to say next how you are going to respond to what hes saying what to do if there is a lull in the conversation all of this can be solved by listening Its difficult to listen to someone and also focus on how nervous you are â listening attentively should take your attention away from yourself and bring it to the subject at hand   Try to respond with meaningful followup questions or something that shows your crush you are interested and listening If your crush is talking about taking scuba lessons ask him how he became interested in diving or where hes taking classes or how long it will take to become certified Dont see a pause in the conversation as an opportunity to change the focus over to yourself Conversations should be giveandtake so you shouldnt spend the entire time talking about your crush but it also shouldnt seem like youre just waiting for him to take a breath so you can talk about yourself Showing that you are a good listener and genuinely interested in your crush and what he has to say can help him feel comfortable around you If it doesnt make you too nervous make eye contact with your crush to show that you are listening and engaged Dont stare â that could be a little too intense â but try to meet his gaze occasionally Show that youre listening by nodding or make an affirming sound like Mmm hmm or Right   As superficial as it is people love flattery While you are talking try to compliment your crush on something A compliment is also often a good way to keep the conversation going because it puts it on a new courseIf you know your crush through a sport you could say âIâve seen you playing soccer Youâre really goodâ You could also just say âI like your shirtâ or compliment her on some other aspect of her appearance Limit yourself to one compliment to avoid looking like you are sucking up to her   Another way to flatter and connect with your crush is to laugh at his jokes It shows your crush that you have a similar sense of humor and that you find him funny Laughing together is a great way of connecting and sharing a momentAs you laugh you can even say Youre so funny If want to be extra flirtatious touch your crushâs arm while you laugh This adds another layer of connection and is a way to make your crush feel closer to you   Try to keep running into and talking to your crush Every time you see your crush in the hall or around town say hello Pick up conversations from the last time you talked If you feel like your crush likes you amp up your flirtiness or even ask him out
If your crush doesnt know you exist try introducing yourself If youre in a class together you can use that as an excuse to start talking to your crushFor instance say you have history together You could say Hi Im Janie Were in history together What did you think of that boring lesson Mrs Johnson gave the other day or Hi Im John I sit across from you in math I was wondering if I could borrow your notes for the last class  See if you can get the person to spend time with you If youre able to hang out more you may be able to make friends with the personStart with hanging out at school first Maybe you can eat lunch together or spend some time together in the library   One way to get to know a person is to let them talk about themselves Question them about their lives such as asking them about their favorite color their family or their favorite books and moviesIts important to listen to the answers too That is pay attention to whats being said One way you can show youre listening is by making comments on what the person is saying or asking related questions One way to build a friendship is to laugh and have fun together Share a book of your favorite jokes with the person or giggle together over a silly picture Having fun together can bring you closer Lend the person your book when she asks Bring an extra cookie to school for him when you make some for yourself Offer to take down notes if shes going to be gone for the day Little kindnesses like these go a long way towards building friendship Compliments let the other person know that youve noticed his or her best qualities Plus a compliment will make the person feel good and he or she will associate those good feelings with youDont just limit yourself to compliments about the persons appearance For instance maybe youve noticed how smart she is or that hes a sharp dresser Just make sure your compliment is sincere and tailored to the person youre addressing For instance you could say You always seem to have the right answer in math class You are so smart   You can use an upcoming event as an excuse Maybe someones having a party or your school is throwing a big dance Consider asking your crush if you can go togetherYou could say Hey did you see that dance the schools having It may be dumb but I kind of want to go Do you want to go with me   If youre too embarrassed to ask the person outright try implying that you want to hang out For instance you could say that you really want to go see a new movie which kind of encourages the other person to say he or she would like to see it too Then you can suggest you see it together Tell the person that you like him or her While it can be difficult to do its the best way to gauge the persons feelings In fact its the easiest way to move the relationship forwardFor instance you could say Weve been hanging out for awhile and I really enjoy being with you I think Im starting to like you as more than a friend What are your thoughts on that Be ready for rejection That is your friend may say that she doesnt see you that way She has a right to her feelings Oftentimes you can continue on with your friendship Other times it may become too awkward Still its important to ask if you want the person to be your boyfriend or girlfriend Everyone gets a little embarrassed when it comes to love and crushes Its okay to feel a bit shy when youre asking someone to hang out with you or be your boyfriend or girlfriend If youre already together as a couple kissing may seem like the next natural step However everyone moves at different speeds While you may be ready for it your boyfriend or girlfriend may not be ready Talk to him or her about how she feels about kissingAs an example you could say I like it when we hold hands How do you feel about kissing me   Simply asking is the quickest way to move forward plus it means you have consent Consent is just a fancy way of saying the person gives you permission to kiss him or her Basically youre just asking the person if you can kiss him or her or if youre trying to be kissed youre giving the person permission to kiss youFor instance you can say Can we kiss or Would you like to kiss me You could also say Id like for you to kiss me if youd like to Consent is especially important as you start wanting to get closer to another person Every person has a right to say what happens to his or her own body In other words if you just up and kiss someone you havent given him a chance to say how much he wants to kiss you and that yes is essential Maybe he isnt quite ready for kissing so for now he may say no Once you both have agreed to kissing have fun Just be sure to talk again if you want to move on to something heavier
If someone with whom you are not in a relationship touches you inappropriately that is completely unacceptable Confront the offender immediately Donât worry about being polite Loudly say âStop touching meâ so that other people around you will hear Do not be embarrassed Itâs the creep whoâs touching you that should be embarrassedIf it is someone young and they say something like âI was just joking chill outâ donât pay any attention to that A joke is only a joke if both people are laughing Just say âIt wasnât funny and I wonât let you treat me like thatâ Then walk away  If you feel disgusted or angry donât be afraid to express that You have every right to feel that way and communicating that will show the offender that you mean business Donât be afraid to yell at the person or to say something like âStop it thatâs disgustingâIf you know the person you might be afraid to confront them because you dont want to make things awkward But its the person touching you without your permission who is making things awkward Dont ever worry about upsetting someone who is disrespecting you You have every right to be upset and you need to communicate this You can say something like Stop You have no right to treat me that way or Dont do that or Stop it I dont like that   If the person keeps his hand on you push him away and loudly say âGet off meâ If you are loud someone nearby will overhear what is happening and hopefully they will intervene By pushing him away you should create distance to allow yourself to get awayIf the person is a friend its time to get new friends Friends have to respect one another and this person clearly does not To end a disrespectful friendship you can say something like I dont like the way you treat me and I will not allow you to be a part of my life anymore Then look for friends who are kind to you   Get as far away from the creep as possible If you arenât able to go very far for example if you are on public transit then move to a crowded area The person will be less likely to continue trying to touch you if you are surrounded by othersIf you are at school go tell a teacher immediately You could say Ms Anderson I need to talk to you Jerad was touching me inappropriately and he wouldnt stop This isnt tattling this is defending yourself against someone harming you If you are near your house run home and tell your parents or another adult right away You could say Mom this creepy guy starting touching me in the park   If the person continues to harass you call out for help Simply yell âSomebody help meâ and repeat it until someone hears The yelling will likely alarm the person touching you causing them to back off or someone will hear and interveneYou do not need to deal with this alone If someone has been harassing you and inappropriately touching you as soon as you get to safety call 911 Tell them what happened Tell them where you were and what the person looked like He needs to be arrested so that he will not continue to harass people You could tell the police âI was riding on bus 44 at 200pm and this creepy guy kept groping me and wouldnât stopâ
If your crush is on the other side of the room move to the general vicinity they are in If they are sitting down go sit down at a nearby table with some friends If you and your friends are friends with your crush join them where they are sitting and try to make sure that you are sitting next to your crush If they are dancing dance with a group of your friends either in a group next to your crush or join their group of friendsHanging out near your crush before you approach them makes going up and talking to them less abrupt and more natural   Say hello to your crush and ask them how they are doing Say something like âHey Jamie how are youâ or âHey whatâs upâ If youâve never talked to your crush before introduce yourselfIf at this point your crushâs friends and your friends are hanging out together it should be easy talk to him or her If your crush is with his or her friends approach them with some of your friends This will make approaching your crush easier and wonât put you on the spot While your friends talk to your crushâs friends you can talk to your crush If you and your friends donât know your crushâs friends well enough to talk with them wait to talk to your crush when they are alone getting food checking their phone or coming back from the bathroom   Giving your crush a compliment is a good way of keeping the conversation going Since itâs a dance your crush probably put a lot of time into their appearance so complimenting them will make them feel happy that someone noticedSay something like âYou look niceâ or âI like your dressâ   If you donât know what else to talk about with your crush just talk about the dance   You could ask them how they are enjoying the dance by saying something like âSo are you having funâ You could also talk about something specific about the dance by saying something like âI really like the decorations that they put upâ or âHave you tried the punch Itâs really goodâ   If you and your friends are on the dancefloor near your crush and you start talking to your crush donât go on and on A lot of people talk on the dancefloor while dancing but the dancefloor isnât the right place for a long conversation since your crush might be more in the mood to dance than to talk   If your crush seems like they are into the conversation by all means keep talking However if you are doing most of the talking keep in mind that your crush may be more in the mood to dance   If you are talking to your crush while you both are sitting down allow for pauses in the conversation and look over to the dancefloor as you pause This is a nonverbal way of indicating that you are interested in dancing You can also tap your feet or move a little to the music to show that you like the song If your crush wants to dance with you they may pick up on these cues and ask you to danceIf you are talking to your crush while dancing a pause is also a good way to give them a window to ask you to dance Giving nonverbal cues is a good method for girls to use if they donât feel comfortable asking a guy to dance Since the societal norm is for boys to ask girls to dance girls may prefer to use this method of nonverbally communicating that they want to dance
There are multiple methods for doing this  The safest and most secure method is to unbuckle your horses halter take it off his nose and slip it over his neck with the halter still attached to a lead rope or one crosstie       You can also simply put the reins over the horses neck before removing the halter         Before bridling check the bridle is straight and neat and that the noseband and throatlash are unbuckled You can then guide the bit into your horses mouth There are two methods for doing this  Hold the crownpiece at the top of your ponys head holding it in your right hand Guide the bit in with your left hand       You can also hold the bridle underneath the browband with your right arm reaching underneath your ponys head Guide the bit in with your left hand       If your horse will not take the bit you can squeeze the side of his lip or slide your finger in his mouth and press at the part of his mouth without teeth If you arent sure where this is ask someone to help you         Slide it gently over one ear at a time being careful not to bend them too hard   The throat latch should be loose enough to fit your fist between the latch and his throat The noseband should be loose enough to fit a finger between it and the horses skin   Check that all your horses tack is snug clean and in good condition dont ride with broken or very dirty tack Ensure that all straps are in their keepers and arent too loose or too tight Run up your stirrups before mounting Before you mount tighten the girth  If youre an inexperienced rider always ask your instructor or another experienced rider to give you a safety check before riding       Remember to take the reins over your horses head before leading him
Letting your friend know how you feel might set you free from emotional pressure and pain You wont have as many questions about how they feel whether they reciprocate your feeling or how to read into moments with them You wont have to deal with whatifs or what could have been because youll have your closure  Closure is especially important if you want to move on from this crush With so many unanswered questions you might not feel ready to date other peopleIf you dont tell your friend you care for them they might never know the extent of your feelings Letting them know can help them fully understand your friendship and give you support if needed  If feelings are left unsaid you might distance yourself from your friend or act differently around them without noticing In response your friend might be unsure whats happened They might worry that they did something wrong or that you dont care for them anymore Opening up about your feelings can get rid of miscommunication  Being vulnerable about tough feelings is important in friendships If you cant express your emotions you and your friend may not feel connected or safe around each other When your friend is dating another person its usually best not to tell them about your feelings Telling them you like them could bring conflicting emotions into the friendship and introduce distance Instead wait until they are out of a relationship or until you do not feel obliged to act on the feelings If youre nervous you might be tempted to reveal your feelings over text or online messaging But having serious conversations happen much better inperson Being able to see and hear the other person will leave less room for miscommunication Youll see each others body language and be able to respond immediatelyTry a few deep breathing exercises before you have the conversation to get rid of nervesWrite out your feelings before you tell them if you feel overwhelmed This will give you an outlet and help you express your emotions in a healthy way Sometimes when people reveal romantic feelings the recipient may worry that youre only interested in dating If they dont reciprocate the feeling they might wonder if youre still interested in a friendship Make it clear that you appreciate your relationship with them regardless of their response If they say they reciprocate your feelings you might feel anxious and unsure what to do next If they say they dont you might feel crushed Their emotions are as valid as yours and it is important for you to respect them Dont argue with them or react angrily if their response isnt what you hoped for Thank them for being honest and distance yourself if you need time alone  Hurt grief and pain are all normal reactions to have when grieving Dont suppress your emotions or feel ashamed about them Feeling is part of the healing processIf you find yourself unable to move on from an unwanted answer you may be dealing with depression Talk to a professional like a psychologist or therapist if your feelings cause significant distress
Is she really the girl for you  Hopefully keeping this in mind will inspire confidence since you are already starting at a vantage point Nothing ventured nothing gained   Its better to know that you two didnt have a chance rather than living off false hope Dont lead her on but rather confront her with your feelings Both of your emotions are important in whatever relationship you choose to have with her   This is critical It is important that your admirer accept you for who you are not who you think she wants you to be Any relationship will ultimately fail if you engage in false pretenses   It is easy to sense when someone is insincere Keep compliments brief and not overly personal until you really know her well An insightful compliment that remarks on her behavior personality trait or action can be powerful when delivered at the appropriate time and place It allows her to see that you are not being trite or superficial and that you value her for who she is   Make sure to make eye contact and include her friends in the conversation This not only exhibits good manners but it will ingratiate you with her peers It will also help to make her and others feel less selfconscious if you are friendly and relaxed   This will increase both your comfort levels and give you a common ground on which to build a friendship However if you truly have no interest do not force yourself to attend See 2 and 3 above If there is a predominance of girls in the club dont let that deter you Remember your purpose for attending is to get to know her but if that should not work out you will have expanded your network of other available girls to socialize with in the future The fact that there are few guys in the club means that you have eliminated the competition   Remembering that she likes you and probably suffers from the same insecurities that you do should help to reduce your anxiety If it is meant to be friendship is a process that should develop naturally over time Trust and respect are not earned overnight   Take the initiative When you pass her in the hall say Hi SoAndSo Do it often too
Before you confess try to see if there are any hints that your crush might also like you Ask your friends to see if theyre interested or pay attention to how they treat you Ask yourselfDoes your crush initiate conversations sometimes or do you always start them How often does your crush text Snap or message you Does your crush smile when they see you Does your crush ever make excuses to touch you Do they remember things that you said in the past   When youâre ready tell your crush that you think of them as more than just a friend You can tell your crush in person text them give them a card or send them a message over social mediaYou might say something like âHey I really like you a lot as more than a friend I was wondering do you like me tooâ You should always tell your crush yourself Donât ask a friend to tell them this for you   If your crush likes you back congratulations Now you just need to ask them on a date If you are both allowed to date ask them if they would like to see a movie go to the mall or attend a school dance togetherYou can say âWould you like to go out with me on a dateâ You can also say something like âDo you want to see a movie this weekend with meâ Ask your parents first Your parents may have rules about when you are allowed to date Sometimes your crush may not like you back Thatâs OK It may hurt at first but over time it will get better Distract yourself by getting involved in activities where you will not see your crushYou might feel as though there is something wrong with you but the truth is sometimes people just donât feel the same way about each other This will pass Be sure to talk to your friends about it They can help support you during this time
Attempting to transform your friendship into a dating relationship could have unintended repercussions If things donât work out the friendship might suffer or come to an end as a result If you truly care about the person youâve fallen for think about whether youâre willing to take that chance It may be that you decide that youâre better off as friends and adjust your expectations accordinglyThink about your history with the other person and how they act towards you Do you detect any interest or affection How have things between the two of you progressed since you became friendsIf the person you like tends to emphasize what a good friend you are or compares you to a brother or sister it may be their way of telling you that theyâre satisfied with your established roles  Analyze the nature of your desires Do you have real feelings for your friend or is it simply a physical attraction Itâs normal to be physically drawn to people of the opposite sex that you get along well with and this can sometimes extend to your own friends This doesnât necessarily mean however that the two of you would be able to fulfill each otherâs needs in a dating relationshipBe certain about what youâre after before you make a move An unsuccessful attempt at courting could mean the end of the friendshipHooking up does not necessarily mean leaving the friend zone If anything it could just make things more confusing for both of you   Find out how the person youâre interested in feels by talking to the friends you have in common They can usually provide valuable insight into the mind state of your interest Theyâll also be able to tell you whether trying to pursue a romantic relationship is a good idea or whether youâre putting your friendship in jeopardyIf your mutual friends think thereâs a chance of the two of you getting together have them put in a good word on your behalf or drop subtle clues to your interest Hearing someone close to them say you guys look so cute together or you two would make the perfect couple might make all the difference in changing the way your friend sees you While you should do whatâs right for you itâs also worth considering how you and your friend becoming romantically involved could impact the rest of your friends You may not feel as comfortable discussing the details of your relationship to someone who is also friends with your partner A breakup could also leave your mutual friends conflicted over the best way to stay on good terms with both of you   Even if you decide to take the direct approach donât spill your guts out of the blue Wait until the two of you are alone and can talk openly without distraction or embarrassment Consider other situational details as wellâif your friend is going through a stressful time in their life or just got out of a longterm relationship it may not be the right time to share your feelings with themThe best time to work your way out of the friend zone is when you and your interest get along well spend a lot of time with each other and express your desires and frustrations about dating Youâll already be armed with the resources and information you need to be able to meet their needs Offer to do things with your friend more often and change the nature of your time together Rather than interacting like casual friends the way you always have show more of an interest in them mentally and physically Getting out of the friend zone is often as simple as shifting the way your friend views you and your dynamic together The more time you spend oneonone the more of your true feelings youâll be able to show themA good way to get more face time with the person youâre interested in is to single them out The next time youâre hanging out with your friends engage him or her in a private oneonone conversation or diverge from the group so that just the two of you can do some activity together Invite your friend to do things you know they enjoy like attending a concert going on a hike or playing a sport together   Donât expect a lengthy friendship to turn into a passionate romance overnight Give the other person time to relax and update their perspective Go on a few casual nondates at first then ask for a more formal date when the time is right Let your gestures gradually become more flirty and playful and escalate to more obvious affection later on If you push too much right away you might just end up scaring them offIt can be hard to find a good way to start flirting that isnât awkward Try paying the friend youâre interested in genuine compliments from time to time dropping hints about the things you like about their appearance and personality Eventually theyâll begin to see your comments in a new light Learn to interpret your friendâs behavior If they respond well to lighthearted flirting it could be a good sign If they tend to shut down or change the subject when you show affection they probably arenât interested in you in that way   If there is someone else who you also like then you might consider pursuing this person instead Doing this may give you a chance to process your feelings about a friend while also allowing you to have a romantic relationship Try to identify someone who is not a friend and who you think might be a good match for you Look for someone who shares your interests and someone to whom you are genuinely attracted   Donât pretend to like someone else just to make your friend jealous If you do start showing an interest in someone else make sure that it is authentic Keep in mind that if your friend is interested in you then your new relationship might cause them to act jealous Just make sure that this is not your goal in pursuing someone else   Small physical gestures are a building block of deeper intimacy Try being more handson with your interest Grab his arm suddenly while telling an exciting story or place your hand on the small of her back when sheâs walking through the door ahead of you This kind of subtle contact can awaken arousing feelings in your interest and may create a desire for moreIncrease physical contact with your friend slowly and be respectful Not everyone likes being touched and you may end up sending the wrong message if you act presumptuously or put your hands somewhere they shouldnât be One of the major differences between friends and lovers is that lovers tend to touch each other in more flirtatious suggestive ways When you introduce a more intimate level of contact with your friend it will naturally influence the way they view you and your relationship Whether youâve grown tired of biding your time or youâre just not one to beat around the bush you may prefer to announce your feelings directly to your friend This isnât always a bad idea Find a time when you can sit down with your friend oneonone and talk things out Be heartfelt as you explain yourself but try not to make them feel uncomfortable Let them know that you dont expect them to change the nature of your friendship but that you had to get your feelings off your chest Getting it out in the open will put to rest any doubt in their mind and give you a clear answer about whether or not thereâs a chance of being together as something more than friendsTry saying something like Im nervous about telling you this but I feel or Weve spent so much time together and I like being around you I have feelings for you and  Your friend might be experiencing a similar dilemma but be hesitant to act on it because they donât sense that youâre interested If you can work up the nerve to be honest you have a better chance of receiving a straightforward answer which can save you from having to agonize about the situation for weeks and weeks   If your friend also has feelings for you congrats Youâve successfully escaped the friend zone The two of you can now begin moving your relationship forward Taking things to the next level with a friend can be a wonderfully rewarding experience because itâs a given that your personalities are compatible Youâre already comfortable around your friend and know that theyâll accept you for who you are and this can make maintaining the relationship much easierSince you already know your partnerâs character habits and insecurities you can skip the sometimes awkward first stages of getting to know each other and cut right to showering each other with love and affection Itâs okay to pace yourselves Dating a good friend might feel a little strange at first so give yourself time to adjust as you grow closer As great as dating one of your best friends can be it also changes your dynamic You need to be ready to respect the new boundaries and expectations that arise as your feelings develop Show your partner that you care for them as more than a friend and that you take your new relationship roles seriously Make an effort to put them first rather than treating them like any other friendYou may feel quite comfortable with a close friend becoming your new boyfriend or girlfriend but that doesnât mean that you shouldnât still treat them with the same consideration that you would in any other relationship The behavior that you displayed toward each other as friends might need to be altered in order for your relationship to be successful For example your partner might expect you to text them when you wake up or before you go to bed If youâve historically been bad at texting it may make you look insensitive once youâve started dating As a couple you can keep doing the same kinds of things you used to do together as friends Go see bands you both like hang out with mutual friends or agree on a favorite spot to meet for dinner Your history together as friends will have prepared you for a romance full of fun and excitement and allow you to connect on a much deeper level Youâll be familiar with your partnerâs likes and dislikes right off the bat Best of all the two of you will never run out of things to talk aboutOne of the best things about transitioning from friendship to dating is that thereâs a guarantee that the two of you have lots of things in common This takes the difficulty out of planning dates and thinking of ways to spend time together   Communicate with one another openly and be able to positively resolve issues when they pop up It can be tempting to vent to your other friends when you get upset but this can complicate things and put them in an awkward position as theyâre so close to both of you There needs to be a degree of privacy in your new relationship so you can keep your interactions with friends separate from your life as a coupleSharing too many details about your relationship with your friends could change the way they look at the other person which is tricky if theyâre also friends Fortunately even arguing will be easier if youâve started off as friends as youâll already know what sets the other person off and how to talk to them when theyâre upset   Be prepared to be turned down once you invite your friend to go on a date or make your feelings known They may not feel the same way about you and thatâs okay Smile and go back to acting in a way that you know theyâre comfortable with to reassure them that you still want to be their friend Itâs not the end of the world and youâll feel better knowing once and for all that you gave it the shot it deservedBe able to take ânoâ for an answer Thereâs something to be said for determination but when a guy or girl makes up their mind you should be able to accept itChances are your friend will feel just as bad about turning you down as you do Keep your spirits high so that they wonât worry about damaging your friendship The better youâre able to handle it the more confident theyâll feel in your desire to remain friends   Soothe the discouragement of unrequited love by spending time with your friends and family The more youâre able to laugh and distract yourself the better and more in control of your circumstance youâll feel It will serve as a reminder that you still have people who care about you even when things donât go as you hopedTalking over your problems with someone close to you can often help put things in perspective   Rejection can sting and kind words donât always help Occasionally itâs just easier to be alone Put your social obligations on hold for a while to reconnect with yourself and take inventory of the good things in your life Devote time to developing a skill or enjoying your hobbies Having the ability to comfort yourself in difficult times means that youâll never have to worry about trying and failingDonât make it seem like youâre pouting or trying to punish your friend for not feeling the same way Explain the time you take for yourself as a form of emotional healing and refinement Your nagging need to be in a relationship will disappear once youâre able to find happiness in being alone In the best case scenario you share your feelings with the guy or girl youâre interested in and they suggest that you work better as friends Consider this a stroke of good fortune It may not be exactly what you wanted but itâs a clearcut answer and will let you know exactly where you stand and what aspects of your friendship to work on Think of it as an opportunity to get a fresh start in your relationship and become closer friends than everThereâs no guarantee that you friend wonât change their mind in the future Let yourself be content with simply being friends for the time being but donât feel like all is lost if youâre sure of your feelings for them   Your interest may not feel like they can remain friends with you after finding out how you truly feel about them If this happens understand that youve done nothing wrong Its important that you be honest with yourself and your friend as ignoring your desires can cause the relationship to become frustrating for both of you Sometimes however things just may not work out in your favor Move on and take comfort in the fact that you gave it the chance it deservedFind productive ways of easing the pain like writing out your thoughts in a journal or turning to your other friends for emotional supportIf someone is willing to stop being your friend because theyve been put in a difficult position chances are they didnt value your friendship that much to begin with
This can be a difficult realization because typically crushes are linked to romantic feelings This is not always the case An identity crush is someone you come to view as a leader This causes you to want to identify your attributes to theirs This type of crush opens more doors for developing a friendship You dont need to act uninterested or halfamused Simply ask them to do something you know they like to do like   Play music Go bowling Play golf See a movie Play lasertag Go tubing   Sometimes identity crushes can be for the wrong reasons Lots of time people aspire to be the popular kids in high school but sometimes the popular kids arent good people If youre ever faced with hanging out with a new clique and cant invite youre old friends then weigh your options   This is a great opportunity to hang out with them when you are in your best element Make sure your crush and friends are both okay with this plan This will give your crush the chance to see how you normally act with your friends
Asking a girl out on a date can be frightening but if you make a plan it might not be as scary Think about when where and how you plan to ask her out Try to work out what you want the moment to look like and spend some time visualizing a positive response   You want to look your best when you ask her out for the first time If you are wearing your grubbiest shirt and havenât showered in a couple of days she will not have a good impression of you But you donât need to wear a tuxedo or get a makeover before you ask her out either Just make sure that you are clean wearing some flattering clothes and that your hair and facial hair are groomed Confidence is sexy and one of the most confident things you can do is look her in the eyes when you ask her out While it may feel more comfortable to look at the floor and mumble your question to her this will not impress her Look her straight in the eyes and hold your head up high to show her that you are confident The way that you stand can also indicate how confident you are If you are slumping or crossing your arms she might interpret this as fear or nervousness Instead stand up tall with your arms hanging loosely at your sides Keep your shoulders back and your chest puffed out a bit This will show her your full height and breadth which will be much more impressive than if you approach her in a hunched over position Thereâs no need to talk to her for an hour before you ask her out In fact if you take too long to ask you might lose your nerve Instead walk right up to her give her a quick compliment and then tell her that youâd like to spend some time with herIf youâd rather call her thatâs fine too just donât ask her out via Facebook or text message or she may think that you are too nervous to talk to herTry saying something like âHi You seem really cool Listen I am in a bit of a hurry but I thought Iâd see if you would be interested in going out with me sometime Can I get your numberâ   Sometimes despite your best efforts a girl will say no when you try to ask her out The occasional âNoâ is something that you will have to deal with when you ask a girl out on a dateIf she says no donât get upset Just shrug it off and try not to act like too disappointed   Try saying something like âItâs cool You just seem like a fun person to chill with so I thought Iâd ask But no worries Have a good dayâ
Make sure your palms are down  Remember quietly
Sure you should look good when you plan to tell your crush how you feel Just dont dress up to the nines if you normally rock a casual look or put on a brandnew outfit if youre always seen in cozy clothes You dont want your crush to think that youre trying too hard to send them the right message Just try looking a bit more dressed up and well groomed than you normally do  this will boost your confidence when you share your feelings   If you want to get the best results then you have to pick a time when you and your crush can be fairly alone in a stressfree environment You may not want to do it between classes when your crush may be caught off guard or worried about the math test they have to take next period Instead pick a time when you know you can be alone like after school or at a group event when you know you can pull them away to chat for a while   Dont make a big deal about it  make it sound like you could be asking for help with your homework or something Let your crush know that you wanted to talk about something in a one on one setting but that theres not a lot of pressure to have a serious conversation The more casual you can be without making it sound too casual the better Just say Hey I wanted to talk to you about something after school do you have a minute   You shouldnt immediately spit out the words I like you because your crush may still be a little uncomfortable or confused about why youre alone Instead put them at ease by making a silly joke poking fun at yourself or laughing extra hard at something they say Laughing will put your crush in a positive frame of mind and itll make them more receptive to whatever you want to say   Theres no need to delay Once youre alone and have made your crush comfortable you should just tell them how you feel The sooner you do it the better and the less likely youll be to make yourself more nervous or likely to ramble on about something unrelated Just be simple and direct Say I wanted to tell you that I have a crush on you or I really like hanging out with you and I want you to know that I have feelings for you   When you tell your crush look them in the eye and relax your body Dont stand too close to them or look at the floor or youll look either too eager or too withdrawn Use your crushs name when you tell them how you feel Michael theres something I want to tell you sounds more personal than just saying I want to tell you something Dont build up to the thing you have to say too much This will only put pressure on yourself   Dont immediately put pressure on your crush and say So what do you think Its likely that your crush is thrown off guard and needs some time to consider your words whether they share your feelings or not Take a few deep breaths step back and wait for your crush to respond Your crush may immediately say that they return your feelings but its more likely that your crush may need more time and will say Cool thanks for telling me or Can I have some time to think about it Thats perfectly natural If you want to increase the chances of your crush liking you you should play it cool after you put your cards on the table
Pick her up a nice coffee fancy tea wine beer or any other drink that she enjoys Although youâll still need to express your appreciation for her in conversation it may give her a hint that you really enjoy spending time with her Find out if she has a favorite dessert The next time you hang out give her something she really likes For instance you could treat her to an ice cream candy chocolate bar crepe chocolate cake or a piece of pieAsk her what she likes best You might say âwhats your favorite candy bar   You could start finding common interests by sharing books with her Although she may not have the same taste in reading you can express how much you value her opinion and ideas by sharing a book that you really like After she reads it listen to her opinions about the book If you show a genuine interest in her ideas sheâll hopefully get the hint that you like her on multiple levels including her mindDonât be offended if she doesnât like the book You can always find other things in common   Express your feelings for her by compiling a mix tape Add songs that you have listened to together as well as songs that you want her to hear because of their significance for you Try to tell a story with the mix tape such as a story about your growing relationship or your feelings for herInstead of a tape make a Spotify playlist for her Give the mix tape after you have had a chance to get to know her

Do they seem to like your crush Have you caught them looking at your crush often even briefly How often have you seen the popular guy or girl talking to your crush If they seem to like your crush then you will have to work even harder especially if your crush seems to be liking the popular kid back  Are you shy but theyre outgoing You may see shyness as a disability but shyness can have a cuteness to it that an outgoing personality just doesnt have Embrace and bring out the cuter part of your shyness by blushing and doing other cute things that shy girlsboys usually do naturally If its vice versa then be bold strike up conversation and dont be afraid to lightly tease the guygirl you like Are you usually rebellious but the popular kid is usually more mild Let the rebel in you show as rebel girlsguys can be hot and fun Show them your wild side appropriately mind you by not being afraid to dance and have fun at parties and ignoring the popular kids if they try to insult you or even better coming up with a sassy clever comeback to say to them If its vice versa then try to show him the sweetness of a mild more simple personality by doing nice little things for him like being there for him when hes upset and befriending him Basically use whatever qualities you have against the popular kid in your flirting   This basically means trying to incorporate their personality into your personality If youre a rebel and the other person is mild try toning down your wild side and being a little less intimidating and reckless and looking before you leap However dont kill the rebel in you either and remember the last step If the other person is more of a rebel than you then try being a little more rebellious yourself by being less afraid of risking embarrassed and being able to laugh embarrassment off taking a few risks as long as they dont endanger your life and arent too extreme and standing up for yourself and others boldly Just remember to still be mild and simple yet interesting If youre a shy guygirl try being a little more outgoing and making some small talk with your crush even if it is sprinkled with shyness You could also flirt a bit more boldly by catching their eye and winking but then blushing and turning away shyly or teasing them lightly but then acting a little embarrassed and laughing a little to add some of your shy style to your flirting technique If youre more of the outgoing bold type be a little bit shy as well If youre an outgoing girl try shyly playing with your hair giggling or biting your lip If youre an outgoing guy try looking away from them a little more quickly if they look at you and even laughing nervously sometimes Just make sure that you still talk to your dream guygirl often and stay bold   Most of the time popular girls wont befriend their crushes theyll just flirt however popular guys will usually befriend them so this method might not work as well for the guys However it cant hurt to be a friend to your crush either way This can help your crush to feel closer to you and less intimidated by your attempts at flirting andor breaking the touch barrier This can also possibly make them more open to hugs and such   This can usually be a point where you have an advantage over a popular kid because since they are so popular and they have a lot of attention they dont have much time to just hang out with their love interest and are busy with other people as well This doesnt call for being clingy and never leaving your crush alone but it does call for being there for your crush when they need it and just spending time getting to know your crush Heshe will really appreciate it and it may make them think all the more about you If youre worried that your crush will be uneasy with spending time with you become their friend see last step or just happen to end up sitting with them in class or at lunch   Dont do it nonstop or youll appear creepy and itll seem like youre stalking them Just a simple hey Hows it going and a smiley face will do   Just say something like Hey can I ask you something Then say I was wondering if we could go out sometime If they dont answer say something like You can get back to me on it if youd like okay If they decline the offer say Thats fine Lets just keep being friends then if thats alright Stay calm and cool and dont stay as casual as possibly
It may seem like a clichÃ but finding a smear of lip gloss in a shade you donât wear on his shirt is a good sign that heâs cheating Smelling another womanâs perfume on his hair or clothing is another warning signIf you notice a lipstick stain or strange perfume on your boyfriend once it may just be from a friend or relative so you shouldnât necessarily worry However if it happens more than once you may have cause for concern  When a guy starts seeing a new woman he often starts to take more pride in his appearance so he may starting working out more using selftanner or whitening his teeth If his grooming routine begins to change it may mean that heâs seeing someone elseA guy whoâs cheating may shower more often because heâs trying to wash away another womanâs perfume so if your boyfriend is suddenly showering two or more times a day you may have reason to be concerned   Most of us have our phones with us at all times so thereâs nothing suspicious if thatâs the case with your boyfriend However if he never lets it out of his sight so he even takes it to the bathroom with him that may be a sign that heâs hiding something like another girlEven people who are in a relationship deserve privacy so itâs never a good idea to go through your boyfriendâs phone to look at the call log text messages or emails Thatâs true even if you suspect that heâs cheating   Thereâs nothing wrong with having a Facebook Twitter Instagram andor other social media account However if your boyfriend is constantly scrolling through his Twitter or Instagram feed it may be a sign that heâs no longer committed to your relationshipIf your boyfriend is a social media addict he may be using the apps to communicate with other girls or even meet new people Just as with his phone you should respect your boyfriendâs privacy even when youâre suspicious Donât try to figure out his social media passwords so you can go through his accounts   Thatâs a classic sign that he has something to hide particularly if he always used to leave them open before He may be calling or texting another girl and trying to prevent you from finding outEven if your boyfriend isnât closing doors in order to communicate with other people it can still be a sign of a problem in your relationship because it signifies emotional distance If friends and family members that you trust start dropping hints that your boyfriend may be seeing someone on the side you may want to evaluate your relationship and see if there may be truth to their suspicionsAlways consider the source when it comes to accusations that your boyfriend is cheating Some friends and family members may be genuinely concerned about you but others may be letting their own baggage affect their perception For example if you have a friend whoâs recently had a significant other cheat on her she may be more likely to accuse your guy even if heâs done nothing wrong
Using your body language to show him you like him means that you use subtle signals such as facing him or touching his arm that will hopefully catch his attention Try to sit by him when you can and when youâre talking with him make sure that you have your whole body facing him Donât cross your arms while youâre talking as this creates a defensive positionDonât forget to smile when youâre talking to him Realize though that some boys wonât really be paying enough attention to notice your body language He may feel too nervous around you to be paying any attention to subtle signals  Giving him a compliment will show him that you are paying attention to him You can think about things he is really good at or something you really like about how he dresses and compliment thatGiving him a compliment every now and then may give him the confidence to tell you that he likes you   For example you could say âHey I just wanted to let you know that I think your outfit makes you look really nice todayâ If he plays a sport you can tell him how good he is at it for example âI saw your soccer game yesterday That was a really awesome goal you scoredâ Donât overdo it A compliment every now and then is OK but giving a compliment multiple times a day may make him feel uncomfortable   A shy guy may be reluctant to look you in the face but if you can try to make eye contact with him If you do catch his eye flash a quick smile and hold the eye contact for about 3 seconds Then get on with whatever you were doing If you are able to do this heâll get at least an inkling of an idea that maybe youâre into himMaking eye contact doesnât mean staring If you make eye contact for too long he may get embarrassed   It may be that you are only around this shy boy in front of his or your friends so you may not get to spend much time talking to him When you are together try to focus your attention on talking to him without ignoring everyone else Ask him questions about things he likes or what he thought about a new movie that came outTry to ask questions that will require more than a âyesâ or ânoâ answer For example donât say âDid you like the game on Fridayâ instead say âTell me what you thought about the game on Fridayâ If you are in a group donât ignore everyone just casually try to engage him in conversation while everyone else is talking If you are alone this will be easy He may seem as though he has nothing to say but if you keep coming up with new things to talk about heâll hopefully come out of his shell a bit   One of the most common ways to show someone that you like them is to simply flirt with them When most people think of flirting they think of doing it in person but if that seems to scary you can also try flirting with him over text message email or chat   When flirting via text use emojis One of the most common emojis used when flirting is the winky face which keeps things light and fun Try to make a bit of physical contact when flirting in person For example if you are sitting next to each other you can subtly let your knee touch his knee or you can brush some imaginary dirt off of his shoulder When flirting dont forget to smile Flirting is supposed to be light and fun If you are being very serious he probably wont think that you are flirting Tease him just a little bit With shy guys you definitely dont want to overdo this However teasing him just a little bit might show him that you are interested When you tease him be sure to smile and laugh and maybe gently touch his arm to let him know that you arent trying to be mean at all   Most boys like to be reminded of their masculinity Getting him to help you with something may help him feel courageous enough to make a move When asking him to help you try to think of something that will make him feel toughFor example ask him to lift something a bit heavy Dont be unrealistic here and make sure that you choose something he can actually lift You could say something like Hey Josh Im trying to put these big heavy books back up on the shelf but theyre too heavy for me I know youre strong could you help me   Telling a shy boy that you like him is tricky because in a facetoface encounter he might get too embarrassed and react differently than he really wants to You can tell him facetoface but make sure that you do it when you two are alone and well out of sight of any of his or your friendsWhen you tell him try to keep it casual If youâre not certain that he likes you or youâre afraid he will get embarrassed you can make it lighthearted and easy For example instead of saying âI really like you and I want to be your girlfriendâ you can say âI was thinking that since we get along so well and have so much fun together that maybe we should go to the dance together next Fridayâ This will give him a way to agree that he likes you without actually having to say it out loud If you are friends on social media you can tell him via chat you can tell him over email or text or you can even just write him a letter However if you are worried that he maybe doesnât like you back he might show what you have written to his friends Hopefully he wonât do this but be aware that spilling your feelings in written form leaves a record of what youâve said   When you tell him you like him try to be friendly and sweet to him Realize that for a shy boy talking to a girl he likes is probably one of the scariest things in the world He might react strangely to your confession even if he does like you too Try to be ready for this possibility and if he does react weirdly or says something defensive try to stay friendlyYou can say something like âOK donât worry about it I just wanted to see what you thought Let me know if you want to talk about it more some timeâ This has the added benefit that if he truly doesnât feel the same then you have easily and gracefully left the conversation without embarrassing yourself too much Being sweet and friendly may also encourage him to feel less afraid to talk to you   If you tell him facetoface youâll get some sort of reaction right away though the reaction he gives you may not be the one he meant to give you If you write him a text or an email you may not get any reaction at first There are lots of reasons that he may not respond to you right away On the other hand if you wrote him weeks ago on social media and you know heâs seen your message then he may just be afraid of hurting your feelings   Give him a few days to respond He may need some time to think about what he wants to say or he may just be really busy Maybe he doesnât get on social media everyday or doesnât check his email often If he hasnât responded after a week or two consider taking him aside to ask him about it Tell him itâs no big deal if heâs not interested but you just wanted to make sure he got your message   Of course it may be hard to find out how he acts when youâre not there but try to observe him from afar If you see him across the lunch room see how he is acting with his friends Is he talking a lot or is he quiet If heâs very talkative around other people but quiet around you thereâs a good chance that he feels nervous about saying the wrong thing in front of youIf he is a quiet person all the time it may be hard to tell this way Look for other ways to know if he likes you too   When youâre around does he avoid looking directly at you Is he sweating Is he defensive if someone teases him If he is not normally like this but seems to be when youâre around he may be worried about doing or saying the wrong thing in front of you especially if he is shyIf a boy likes you heâs more likely to seem as though he is nervous or anxious when you are around If he isnât really in to you he will be more standoffish   A shy guy is likely to be fidgeting with his hair or his clothes when you are around or he may cross his arms in front of his chest Shy boys are more likely to feel nervous around their crush so they may seem defensive when in fact they are actually very interestedYou may find that your shy boy often tries to be around you but not really near to you For example he may find excuses to hang out with your group of friends but heâll always try to sit as far away from you as possible Donât take this as a sign that he doesnât like you   If you are friends on social media think about how he treats you Did he find you and friend you Is he constantly liking everything you post If so thereâs a pretty good chance he is interested in you but hasnât gotten up the courage to do anything about itYou can also try to hint to him that youâre interested by friending him if youâre not already friends and showing appreciation for his posts by liking them or making a comment Donât overdo it though You donât need to like every single thing he posts rather just a few to show him that you are paying attention
If she is always really serious around you she might not like you It could just mean she is shy or not a humorous person but often girls joke around with guys they like If she genuinely seems like she is having fun with you â teasing you joking around with you and laughing at your jokes â she might like you If your conversations consist only of basic daytoday small talk âHow was your weekendâ or âIt is really warm out todayâ she might not like you Although it could also mean she is too nervous to ask you anything deeper If she is asking you about your life and interests and telling you about hers she might be interested in you  If she has never brought him up or only says negative things about him her feelings for him could be fading If she goes on and on to you about how perfect he is she probably does not like you It can be complicated though because it is possible to have feelings for more than one person   If she says âTanner bought me roses yesterday and we are going out to dinner tonight He is the best boyfriendâ she probably does not like you If she says things like âTanner and I got in a huge fight last night because we never do anything togetherâ her heart might not be all in the relationship   If she goes out of her way to talk to you and give you attention she might like you Is she speeding up to catch up with you and talk to you or does she only talk to you if you happen to be near each other If she seems to be going out of her way to talk to you and show you attention she might like you  Pay attention to your online conversations not just the conversations you have in person If she never sends you texts or snapchats she might not like you Although she might not be doing this because she has a boyfriend If she always sends you texts or snapchats about her daytoday activities or asks you about yourself she might be interested If she only texts you once a month to ask about school or work maybe not
There is always a right time and a right place There is also always a wrong time and a wrong place One of the best ways to spend time with your crush is in class or at lunch There are many classes in this world but here is the basic classes with a few extras  The place where you will discuss books by amazing authors such as John Steinbeck and Mark Twain Make use of your time with your crush by discussing the book before class starts whether you love it or hate it If he has a different view of the book then make your conversation a little flirty debate Or if you are writing an essay or a short story ask him if he wants to peer edit with you If he says no say something a bit flirty like You sure Because I know a lot about The Scarlett Ibis and you would be lucky to have me to edit your essay If he still says no find someone else to edit with Theres always another essay in English class and peer editing with another boy might even make him jealous   So what if you hate problems with fractions or if you enjoy solving problems with the layout of ymxb Your math class is another good place to spend time with your crush Suggest doing some of the homework together if you have trouble Or ask him for help if he is good at math Its the other way around Then say to him Hey you look like youre having some trouble Need help Your dream boy will most likely appreciate your help   Ah another class involving lots of writing This is another class that you can ask your crush if he wants to peer edit your essays on the Civil War You can also discuss the topic your class is learning about like the presidents You can even get into a flirty debate about which president was the worst in history   This is a great class to partner up with your crush for labs If your teacher assigned you two together thats great Chat a bit while you two complete your work If not talk to him after class Ask him who is his partner and tell him who is yours Then say something like Maybe next time well be partners for a lab You can make science a bit fun with a little contest Try naming the most bones in the human body or name the elements on the periodic table the quickest It will help you learn better   Whether youre a jock or rather be sleeping it is time to break a sweat with your crush Challenge him to a quick game of basketball or four square with others Partner up when your class is forced to practice kicking the soccer ball or race each other during the mile   Okay this is not a class but it is still a time to flirt with your crush At lunch try sitting with him and talk about low key things such as class movies books tv shows or family Guys dont want to hear drama queens telling stories about a serious fight with a friend If you cant sit with him casually walk by his table wave and say hi   This another non class but passing time at school is good for a quick chat If you see him casually say hi and smile If you want to talk to him more ask him a quick question ex Hey whats the French homework or What do we do in English today
Often itâs as easy as making eye contact and smiling to get a girl to smile back If it doesnât work keep trying and you might get a smile yet You might even try a sillier smile to see if it might make her laugh Smiling is a good way to open up a conversation because it makes both you and her happierWhen you smile it literally changes chemicals in your brain making you feel happier and smiles are catching That means when someone sees a smile they want to smile too making them happier  Ask questions about her and what she likes Find things you have in common By discovering what you both like she might see you in a different way than before And shell smile because it shows that you enjoy talking to her It also sets you up with ideas of what to do in the future Everyone likes to hear nice things about themselves and so a compliment is sure to make her smile The best compliments are sincere which means you really mean it Take a moment to study her so you can tell her what you really do like about her You dont have to stick to looks You can also compliment her brains her brilliant smile or her sparkling witFor example you could say The dress looks good on you You could also say You know youre really smart You always seem to have the right answer in class Another option is You have the best hair I love how wavy it is

The most important thing about a dolphin stranding is keeping everyoneâpeople and dolphinâsafe The best way to do this is to report the dolphinâs presence to the local police They will know what experts to contact to get proper care for the dolphin   The police may come to the scene to barricade the animal in order to prevent it from spreading disease The dolphin may not have stranded itself because itâs sick but if it is the disease could pass to humans through contact  Although the police will probably do this for you itâs a good idea to report what you see directly Do an internet search for âmarine animal rescue serviceâ or âregional stranding networkâ with your location to find one   Every coastal region of the United States has a volunteer stranding network The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA connects with these networks to saved stranded mammals of all kinds as well as turtlesMake note of the dolphinâs physical characteristics so that the marine rescue agency you contact can bring the right equipment Even if the mammal is dead the body needs to be removed from the beach to protect swimmers and other beachgoers Calling the authorities is the right thing to do whether itâs alive or dead   Watch the blowhole Dolphins breathe out of this hole not their mouths so keep an eye on the blowhole for exhalation You can do this without touching the dolphin Most dolphins can hold their breath for a long time so wait about 20 minutes for breathing or movement If there isnt any the dolphin is probably deadIf the dolphin is dead protocols like staying quiet do not apply but staying back and not touching the dolphin become even more important in order to prevent the spread of disease   If you are the first responder to a stranded dolphin itâs your job to coordinate the safety of both those near the dolphin and the dolphin itself The most important thing for the safety of both is no contact Keep people dogs and anything else at least 50 feet away from the dolphinAsk them to keep quiet so the dolphin doesnât get upset   Tell any crowd that has gathered what youre doing in a calm low voice Explain that the dolphin is probably scared and to please keep their voices down If you donât feel comfortable taking charge quickly find someone who will step in   Once people have moved away from the dolphin recruit others to assist you The more people are in the crowd the more help you will need especially if there are young children and pets present   Trying to move a dolphin will make its current injuries worse or injure it in a new way The best thing for the dolphin is to let it lie still until professionals arrive with proper equipment   Marine animals carry diseases Although scientists are not completely sure why dolphins strand themselves one theory is that it is most likely due to diseaseSuch diseases can easily pass to humans so the best thing to do is not touch the dolphin   Illness in wild animals is especially a concern for young children whose immune systems are not as strong as those of adults Take special care that kids do not touch the dolphin If you do come in contact with a dolphin immediately wash your hands and skin   A stranded dolphin is a wild animal It may feel threatened by your presence and choose to attack those near it   Although dolphins usually defend themselves by swimming in packs of about 12 dolphins called pods they can do some damage on their own with their strong beaks and tails   Dolphins are strong muscular creatures Make sure that if you are standing near or working with a stranded dolphin be far from the face and tail   A dolphinâs most powerful feature is its tail Do not hold or even touch the tail By shaking its head from side to side a dolphin can strike anyone within range Make sure anyone who is authorized to help the dolphin stands clear of the face and the range of its snout   It may take some time for the authorities to arrive While you wait use your volunteers and keep the crowd at least 50 feet away from the dolphin Remember to have people keep their volume down so the dolphin is kept as calm as possible   Explain to everyone that the dolphin can both hurt people standing too close and spread disease if touched This explanation will more than likely keep people from ignoring you If you do see someone touch the dolphin make sure they wash their skin immediately If the dolphin hurts someone call 911 again to get an ambulance ready   A dolphinâs blowhole is located on the top of its head Any debris or blockage of this holeâeven from waterâcan cause suffocation   Never get water or sand anywhere near a dolphins blowhole Just like a human can drown if too much water comes into our mouths dolphins can drown from water blocking their blowholes   If the dolphin is lying on its side or back this means the blowhole is at risk of being blocked or is blocked entirely whether by sand or water Since this will cause suffocation there is an immediate need for someone to roll the dolphin onto its stomach   Only proceed with this step if you have assistance and are confident you know what youâre doingDo not pull on the fins or tail or try to push the dolphin back into the water   Soak towels in water and lay them over the dolphin If someone has a bucket they can pour water over the dolphinâs back making sure not to get water near the blowhole   You can cover the dolphin with a wet towel below its blow hole if you cut a slit for the dorsal fin which is the fin on the dolphinâs back Fit the towel very carefully over the dorsal fin   If the dolphin is in direct sunlight create shade for it with a beach umbrella or other device making sure it doesnât come in contact with the dolphin at any time   This will make the dolphin more comfortable as it is not used to being on land The pectoral fins also known as flippers are not made for flat surfaces   You can also dig a hole under the chest and fill it with water This will not only keep the dolphin wet but it will support its chest while relieving pressure on the lungs and flippers When the authorities arrive get out of their way and help the crowd stay out of the way too The professional marine mammal rescuers that have arrived know how to take care of the dolphin better than you do so making sure no one interferes is the best thing you can do for the dolphin   Even with your best efforts if a live stranded dolphin is already injured dehydrated or very sick it may not survive its rescue This may be especially difficult for children who are observing the rescue to cope with
Especially if it pains you to even think about them Theyre not worth a quick thought   If you do something like go to the beach with your best friends or have a barbecue with your family youll be too busy having fun to think about the person   Go shopping with your BFF or siblings   This is something I had a lot of trouble doing Dont yell at yourself if you still like the person over time the crush will fade   Dont worry youll find that perfect person one day This person was a lesson to be learned from so watch for the signs of what to avoid in future

This prevents one or both parties from becoming hurt throughout the process of trying to make your ex jealous A healthy approach to jealousy is when your goal is to deepen or rekindle your relationship with your ex while an unhealthy approach is when you want to seek revenge or intentionally hurt your ex for breaking it off in the first place Ending all contact with your ex can make her wonder what youâre up to and why youâre no longer talking to her She may suspect that youâre seeing someone new or keeping busy with fun activities that donât involve her If you donât feel comfortable ceasing all contact at least wait two or three weeks before contacting her again   An old Spanish proverb says âLiving well is the best revengeâ which is great to keep in mind when making your exgirlfriend jealous Improving yourself as a person is healthy and boosts your selfesteem when youâre going through a breakup Exercise more often devote more time to friends and family read books and make other positive changes that will have your ex questioning whether your life is better without her   This indirectly keeps your ex in the loop with whatâs going on with you even if youâre not staying in touch with your ex Your friends may even mention to your ex that theyâve seen you and that youâre doing well without her For example inform your friends that you recently got a job promotion lost weight or have plans to run the next 5K marathon The news may circulate back to your ex and make her feel jealous about your accomplishments Your ex may browse your social media profiles out of curiosity to see how youâre getting on without her and to see if youâre spending time with someone new Keep all social media posts positive in nature and try to be mysterious without posting explicit details For example share photos of yourself having fun with friends on a Friday night without explaining where you are or what youâre celebratingShare photos of yourself spending time with other women especially those you consider attractive Seeing you having fun with other women can make your ex feel jealous and confused about her true feelings for you   If meeting your ex in person is inevitable due to seeing her at work or spending time with mutual friends smile and say hello then move on with your day This positive behavior can make your ex wonder why youâre not unhappy without her and also shows that youâre confident and have moved on   If your ex tries to call or text you donât reply right away This makes it look like youâre busy and will make your ex feel curious about what youâre up to This also helps you avoid looking desperate to hear from her Depending on the nature of your exâs phone call put off returning her call for several hours or several days Though you may still have feelings for your ex and want to win her back reentering the dating scene is a natural way to make your ex jealous because it makes it look as if youâve already gotten over the breakup and moved on Plus you may end up meeting someone you enjoy spending time with more than your ex

One of the more challenging moments of starting a conversation is the opening lines You can tackle this challenge head on by starting with a friendly smile making eye contact and using small talk Small talk is good at breaking the ice and being friendly while still being casual and calmTry to use small talk that is direct but also open ended Rather than say âHi how are youâ frame the conversation by saying âHi how was your weekendâ or âHow was your dayâ This gives the guy a chance to tell you about his weekend or his day leading to more conversation and connection   Once you have broken the ice with an engaging question you may then ask follow up questions about something the guy mentions in his response Focus on maintaining positive body language as you ask him questions as this will indicate to him that you would like to continue the conversation with himFor example if the guy mentions he struggled with a test that day you may ask âWhat did you have trouble onâ or you may say âI remember taking that test and it was difficult I can study with you next time if youâd likeâ Be helpful and open as he will feed off of your positive energy and respond in kind You may also ask him thoughtful questions that will help to create an interesting conversation For example maybe you both just handed in a difficult assignment and are talking in the hallway You may ask âDid you find the assignment difficultâ or you may make a light hearted comment that you can both bond over such as âI hope I passed How do you think you didâ   During the conversation you should also be willing to share information about yourself and respond to his questions Providing detailed answers to his questions will show him you are engaged in the conversation and interested in connecting with him Though you may be a bit uncomfortable sharing information about yourself it will help the guy to feel more at ease and indicate to him that you are trying to build a relationship with himFor example if he asks you âHow was your weekendâ avoid answering with âGoodâ or âOkayâ Instead you may tell a funny moment that happened over the weekend when you were out with friends or family Or you may tell him you spent most of the weekend studying or reading but you did get a chance to go for a walk or go to the gym Try to be honest and also focus on details that might add interest to the conversation   You can also foster good conversation with the guy by being a good listener when he speaks You can do this by maintaining eye contact with him nodding your head and smiling when he speaks You can also take a moment to process what he is saying in a thoughtful way before you respond to him to show him you are listeningBeing a good listener also means asking thoughtful questions and then not interrupting the guy when he speaks Demonstrating good listening skills will also allow him to show you the same courtesy when you are speaking   Humor is always a good way to get over any awkwardness especially if you are talking to a guy for the first time You can make a joke by commenting on something you did over the weekend in a funny way or by referring to yourself in a self deprecating way Jokes are a good way to add some levity to the conversation with the guy and connect with humorFor example maybe you and the guy both just took a difficult test You may make a joke about wishing you could text a friend for the answers or regretting your Netflix binge instead of studying This is a funny way to talk about the test and joke around with the guy making the conversation feel more relaxed and casual
There are boys in this world who just want you for your beauty and body or because they want to be well known Not because youre kind or smart or independent or brave or strong or courageous and etc If its all for the wrong reasons then politely tell him youre not interested in being in a relationship with them  Some may act nervous and fidgety because theyre lying or because they feel like theyre a stalker for noticing all this If they laugh and act like its a joke then its probably because theyre not serious or they think its romantic You can usually tell the difference   You cant really say no and not hurt him but if you do it gently you can remain friends   Explain that you prefer him more as just a friendif he was a friend but you are flattered   Hopefully he will react well and ask if you can still be friends or something like that If his reaction is sadness try to console him and tell him that you are always there as a friend  but avoid physical contact as this could exasperate him further If his reaction is anger and he gets violent or aggressive just give him a sympathetic look and say Im sorry and walk away from him as causally and as fast as you can Or if youre lucky and a friend happens to near by call them out and start a conversation and act really interested with while leaving him like your friend is telling you something very interesting and amusing   Probably talk about all the things you look for in a guy and what you dont like And if you want to avoid him asking you out for a whileor ever just causally say Im not really interested in going out right now I would like to just be friends first before taking things up a notch or just simply Im not interested in going out right now
For one hell think youre a tiny bit lifeless if youre always sitting at your keyboard not to mention if youre not there in the first place you arent tempted to talk with him Plus extended times in front of your computer gives your skin a funny look which wont make him like you any more  While they are wet you cant type so fast without smudging them and it looks nice and shows you care for yourself   Having five other conversations going at once will stop you answering him straight away especially if you tell yourself not to answer him until you have answered everybody else first   If you can close your eyes and enjoy your favourite song it distracts you from him   If you look at what hes said  then you can start thinking about a great reply that will make him laugh or make him think or generally think youre an allround great person   If he logs on and your hand flies to the start conversation button he will probably get annoyed Wait around a bit and if he doesnt start a conversation with you after ten minutes or so say hi otherwise let him do the talking   Racing games are good distractions as you cant just stop and go back five minutes later Avoid the pause button and finish your game when he says anything   If you feel its been going on a long time just say that youve got to leave If he asks answer vaguely to create an air of mystery
It is also known as the horses blind side The horse doesnt kick mostly when you stand on the left side for saddling or patting a new horse  Whether it be on a saddle stand or a nearby fence have it ready to be put straight on the horse so you do not have to make the horse wait any longer than necessary Also make sure the top of the saddle pad is covering the horses withers Note When saddling a horse English style there may be two saddle pads Put on the first one and then the second You dont want more saddle pad on one side than the other The front of the saddle should be about 2 12 inches away from the front of the saddle pad Make sure that the saddle in even on both sides of the horse and not lopsided If you are unfamiliar with the saddle the billet straps are what the girth attaches to and they are located under the flaps on the side of the saddle Tighten accordingly making sure you can fit your hand above the girth Do not tighten the girth too quickly because this tends to lead to a horse learning how to bloat himself to make the girth loose when being saddled

This is a very fun part of having a pet Choose a name that represents the pet you your role model or just pick a name that you really like  Depending on the size of your pet the bowls Bowls are only used for dogs and cats Caged pets usually have a bowl of food and a little drip bottle for water should be refilled about 24 times a day If your pet is an outside pet make sure it has a bowl of water outside as well If you want you can put a bowl of food outside as well but it usually gets attacked by some sort of insects If you have a fish feed it fish food preferably a tropical kind about twice a day once in the morning and once in the evening   Always make sure it has a full bowl of water   If you have a cat make sure you have a litterbox and that the litterbox is always clean If you have a dog make sure to let it outside every other hour or so Or and this applies for dogs and cats you can install a pet door allowing your pet to go in and out as it pleases If you have a caged pet make sure to change out the scraps newspaper shreds or the cage shavings you can buy at a pet store frequently For a fish clean the filter if you have one some fishbowls dont need one once a month Also make sure that the water stays clean   This part is pretty much geared toward cats and dogs Any pet that doesnt have to live in a cage or a bowl Its hard to get a goldfish to shake your hand If you want to keep it from doing something punish it For dogs hit it not smackhard but with a little force on the nose and tell it that was not good or its a bad dog But dont lean in close to its face or scream at it Just use a little force in your voice For cats tell it its a bad kitty and hit it on the head Like I said before only with a little bit of force If you want to commend your pet for something give a treat and shower it in praise For example if you are trying to get your pet to shake your hand gently grab its paw and shake it while saying Shake repeatedly Then give it a treat and give it many complements Do this about four or five times then hold your hand out to it and say Shake If your pet automatically puts its paw there give it a treat and praise it   Make sure your pet always knows that you love it Play with it or pet it or and I know this sounds crazy talk to it Tell it its a good pet   If it needs any shots make sure to get the pet its shots right away   If there are any problems with your pet always go to the vet Better safe than sorry

Choose either end for the treat whichever you think is likely to firmly hold the treat in place  This string needs to be long enough to be tied from the top of the cage to allow the tube to hang with the treat dangling down for the guinea pig to play with   Ensure that the leaf is held in place by the apple piece   Dont add too much though as it can make a guinea pig feel ill   Wait for the guinea pig to discover it and start to enjoy its enrichment treat
Notes are one of the most common and effective ways to confess a crush It tends to be less awkward than inperson confessions giving you some space and comfort if the person doesnt feel the same way Write a short note confessing your crush and pass it to the person in person or put it in their locker   Make sure your note is handwritten legible and relatively short and to the point It doesnt need to be clever or overly romantic Just cut to the chase Ive always noticed that you seem really sweet kind and cute Id love to get to know you better because I really like you When you want to confess to your crush in person is always better than just over a text or online A note is a good balance because it can be personal but also gives you some space if youre nervous If all else fails having a conversation on the phone or via Skype is always preferable to texting it  In some cases your actions can make your crush more obvious than saying You know I really like you If your crush gradually becomes aware that you like them itll be more natural and clear than having to say so bluntly   Go out of your way to talk to your crush and bump into them in the hallway Change your routes so you see them regularly and always make a point of saying hi Always make eyecontact Dont shy away from it like youre embarrassed Make eye contact and smile flirtatiously when you see the person youre crushing on Show an interest in what they do and what they are like Try to get to know your crush as a friend first before you confess anything It may grow naturally   One great way to start a conversation or to get your crush talking is to ask some help with something simpleDepending on who your crush is and what theyre like this can get you into some flirtatious conversations   Ask for help with a homework assignment for a class that youre in together Start with a compliment like You seem so smart in this class Do you think we could talk a little sometime about this assignment I need some help Pretend you lost something Hey have you seen a book around here I just had it When your crush helps out say Youre so sweet   In some cases a rumor started could actually work to your advantage If you tell a friend that youve got a major crush on someone and that gets around to a friend of your crush which gets around to your crush you might have done the job without really doing anything at all Then theyll know and talking will be a lot easier   Tell a couple of your friends and dont be embarrassed about it If it spreads you can always deny it later If you never actually said anything therell be no evidence that you did anything embarrassing or got rejected Never deny it if youre really interested in someone Why would you care if someone knew you liked somebody Thats nothing to be embarrassed about   The scariest thing is not knowing how your crush feels about you Its a lot easier to confess a crush bluntly if youre pretty sure that your crush likes you back One great way of figuring this out is to invite your crush to some kind of event like a party or an afterschool activity which isnt necessarily a date   Keep an eye out for things your crush might enjoy going to I know you really like Marvel movies so I thought you might want to come see the new Iron Man because my dad gets extra tickets I was just curious thought you might appreciate them If your crush gets really excited or seems really flattered and really wants to go with you take it as a good sign and take the next step when you get a chance   Be friendly and flirty whenever you get the chance This can do a whole lot more to communicate a crush than saying so out loud Talk to your crush the same way you might mess around with your friends or other people youre comfortable around Just be yourself   Tease your crush in a friendly way Find funny reasons to let your sense of humor out when you talk to them Instead of saying Hey how are you today say something like Im thinking of organizing a jailbreak from school Need an accomplice What do you say In or out Theres not much romantic about the phrase I have a crush on you Instead of telling someone make it obvious that youre interested so it will become unnecessary to say out loud
Without the benefit of hindsight itâs often quite difficult to know whatâs motivating the other person or what they truly feel or think about you   Rather than assume they must just hate you allow for the possibility that youâre projecting feelings that may not be there Understand that theyâre just as human as you are Everyone has struggles in their lives that contribute to how they actitâs entirely possible your enemy is antagonistic because of difficulties theyre struggling with Learn from the quote often attributed to Abraham Lincoln âI donât like that man I must get to know him betterâ Pay close attention to the people who get along with your enemy Learn from how they handle the dynamic to gain insight into what may not be working between you and your enemy and why   If itâs a kind of behavior youâre comfortable emulating try picking up tips from your observations to see if you can rejigger the tenor of you and your enemys relationship Knowing what theyâre trying to achieve is crucial to dealing with the problem Are they jealous of something you have Did you consciously or unconsciously slight them in some way Do you do something that annoys them   Knowing whatâs driving their behavior can help you get out in front of their negative behavior and possibly blunt the effect their actions have on you   When you know whatâs motivating the personâs behavior you can begin to address it Youâll have two options improve the relationship or learn how to limit their effect on you   If itâs an issue of a small habit or behavior you have that irritates them you can consider not doing those things around them or sitting down with them to explain your behavior and help them accept it If itâs a more serious issue or you simply canât figure out what their problem is confront them about it Nothing shuts down misconceptions or bad feelings like addressing them headon Apologize if itâs warranted If you did something either knowingly or unknowingly to upset them apologize sincerely and donât do it again so you can both move on Talk to the person calmly and coolly Donât accuse or antagonize just have an honest conversation   Even if your enemy says rude or insensitive things about you your friends or your family dont give them the satisfaction of seeing it upset you   In these situations your enemy is simply looking for a reaction and when they get one it will only encourage them to continue the behavior If you want it to stop start by ignoring them and their commentsDonât listen to or spread rumors it only perpetuates the problem The more emotionally engaged you become the more power youâre giving to your enemy Avoid them Limit your contact with them as much as possible Sometimes distance is enough to diffuse the situation Nothing balances the negative impact of an enemy like having allies The more people you have on your side and who see you as kind helpful respectful etc the less impact any potential enemy sabotage can have on youWhen youre tempted to say something negative about your enemy turn that energy around and instead say something nice to another person Spreading positivity rather than negativity will give you the advantage over your enemy
In a game of truth or dare people sometimes joke about what they are daring you to do Making sure they are serious about the dare could help you avoid embarrassment   Replying with a brief laugh and simply saying âAre you seriousâ is enough to double check If they say no then you can always tell them you want to take the dare anyway  Ask yourself if you are comfortable kissing someone or not Remember that itâs okay to say no to a dare If you feel uncomfortable kissing the person then donât do it Itâs better to say no than to do something you donât want to do   Since kissing involves two people you need to make sure itâs okay with the person you were dared to kiss They may not feel comfortable with it even if you want to do it   Asking permission is called âgaining consentâ In situations like this it is the right choice Kissing someone without asking them first can actually be considered sexual assaultBy asking their permission you make the situation safe for both of you   Fresh breath is an important aspect of a good kiss If you have a bad taste in your mouth the person you kiss probably wonât like it Think about what you ate recently and breathe into your hand to check for bad breath Practicing healthy dental hygiene is a good longterm practiceThere are many ways to freshen your breath Brushing your teeth is the best option if you have time If time is more limited chew some gum eat a mint or swish with mouthwash If itâs possible to plan ahead for the chance of a kissing dare buy a disposable toothbrush to have handy   Kissing usually causes excitement throughout your body It increases your heart rate and makes you breathe more quickly You want to be calm for the kiss so take slow deep breaths for a few seconds This may apply more to times when the person is a stranger Making small talk and asking how the other person feels about kissing can ease the pressure Talking about the kiss before you do it can give you confidence   When the excitement of the moment rushes over you itâs easy to move your mouth forward too quickly If you go too fast you may actually hit your mouth against the other personâs mouth causing pain for both of you Donât be afraid to lean forward slowly to make sure you connect just right If touching the hair doesnât feel quite right you can also place a hand on the shoulder This type of touching is just a way to help steady yourself and the other kisser Not tilting your head the right way is a common mistake In general people are more likely to lean to the rightThis may not prove effective every time but the odds are good Which way to lean is also a good topic for the prekiss talk   Since this kiss is on a dare itâs likely that you will not know the person youâre kissing very well It is best to start out slowly and not be too aggressive Donât use your tongue unless you feel your partner initiate it If the kiss is going well itâs okay to let it last a little while If you start to feel uncomfortable or you can tell the other person is go ahead and end the kiss It seems obvious but how the kiss ends is important Donât pull away too quickly If the kiss went on for a while pulling away and then giving a light short kiss is a good way to end it   Once you have successfully completed the kiss and you are looking at each other it may feel awkward Smiling at your partner will help put both of you at ease Whether the kiss went well or not ending it with a smile is better than a frown The kiss was for a dare so donât take it too seriously You may be breathing heavily so take a deep breath like you did before the kiss If you feel comfortable talk to the person you kissed about the experience Breaking the possibly awkward silence will help you move past the kiss and relax   Since dares usually take place in front of other people you may as well act like you did a great job Donât show if you are afraid Donât show that you didnât know exactly what you were doing Just act as if it went well and felt perfectly natural You were dared to kiss someone and you did it You can feel good about taking a new step and you can feel free to stop thinking about it
It can be uncomfortable to bring up a conversation about what forms of intimacy you are comfortable with but it is much better to do this early rather than while you are kissing If you know that you arenât ready for certain forms of intimacy find a time to bring it up so that there arenât any surprises   Sometime while youâre hanging out if there isnât much to do simply start a conversation by saying âHey could we talk about somethingâ You could say something like âIâve been having a lot of fun with you but before things move forward in our relationship I wanted to talk about our physical relationship There are certain things that I am ready for and certain things that I am uncomfortable with Do you mind if we talk about itâItâs ok if you feel a bit awkward bringing this up It can be difficult to discuss these matters You could even acknowledge that you feel a little awkward by saying something like âIâm not really sure how to bring this up but I wanted to talk to you about our physical relationshipâ Or you could say something like âThereâs something Iâve been wanting to talk to you about Itâs a little awkward but I was hoping we could discuss it anywayâ You could then start the conversation by saying âThere are certain forms of touch that I enjoy but other kinds make me uncomfortableâ Decide ahead of time what is ok with you Maybe you are ok with hand holding and cuddling but arenât ready for him to touch your breasts Decide this before talking to him to make sure that you arenât pushed out of your comfort zone by what he is ready for   If your boyfriend is touching you in a way you donât like you can start by simply moving his hand away Maybe he just wanted to try something or got a little carried away By moving his hand you are giving him a clear signal that you arenât comfortable You can simply move his hand from the area that you donât like him touching and put it somewhere that you are comfortable with For example if he is touching your butt and you donât like this move his hand to your hip if you are more comfortable with that or simply hold his hand in yours He should get the hint and know to slow downWhen moving his hand away you can make eye contact with him shake your head and say âNot yetâ This will clearly communicate that you arenât ready to be touched like that You should not have to do this more than once If he keeps trying you need to tell him to stop Instead of moving his hand away you could move yourself away by scooting over If youre sitting on the couch together and hes touching you in an uncomfortable way just scoot further away from him He should get the message that you didnt like being touched   If moving his hand isnât enough and he keeps trying itâs time to tell him to stop Anytime a boy touches you in a way that you are not comfortable with tell him to stop right away It can be as simple as saying something like âHey not nowâ or âIâm not ready for thatâ You could even just say âPlease donât do that Youâre making me uncomfortableâ Your boyfriend needs to respect you and move at a pace that you are comfortable with If he cares about you he will stop right away and wait until you are both readyMake sure you stay firm when doing this or else he might think that you were just flirting or being cute Make it clear that you arenât playing âhard to getâ but youâre genuinely uncomfortable You can even tell him âI donât like thatâ   You can explain to your boyfriend what you are feeling so that he understands You could say âI really like you but I feel uncomfortable when you touch me because Iâm not ready for that yetâ Maybe you would like him to touch you someday but itâs moving too fast You could say something like âI need more time to be comfortable with that Letâs slow downâ When he hears that you are genuinely uncomfortable he should immediately stop pushing it and slow downExplain to him where youâre at so that he knows why he is making you uncomfortable You could say something like âThis is my first time being in a relationship so Iâm not comfortable being touched yetâ Donât be afraid to express how you feel Just because you are uncomfortable being touched doesnât mean you donât care about him It just means you arenât ready for that and that is perfectly acceptable You can say something like âI care about you a lot but Iâm not comfortable being touched like that yetâ   If you donât like one way that he touches you but like other forms of touching clarify that and let him know what you do enjoy You could say something like âI enjoy holding hands and I like it when you put your arm around my shoulder because I feel close to youâ It is important to communicate not only what you donât like but also what you do like This will show him what he can do to make you comfortable while building your relationship
Donât fret about what he might think of your appearance Be comfortable in your body even if his previous girlfriends belong to a totally different âtypeâ Rest assured that guys respond more to your selfconfidence than your looks So instead of stressing out about mirroring his type fix yourself up however you like to Then simply walk into every room like you own it byRefraining from slouching or sticking your hands in your pocketsKeeping your chin up with your neck extended Throwing your shoulders back Allowing your arms to swing freely   Give each interaction the chance to develop into something great Donât shoot yourself in the foot by assuming that everything will go wrongWhen youâre with him avoid overanalyzing the situation Just take pleasure in interacting with him by staying in the moment rather than dwelling on the past or trying to predict the future Respond to what he and anyone else in your group says or does right here right now and nothing moreKeep your mind clear of any preconceived notions about what he might mean with this comment or that look Focus on what goes right a joke that he finds funny his willingness to share his opinions and personal experiences his interest in your own opinions and stories Let the notsoright parts slide Recover quickly by refusing to dwell on them For instance if your joke falls flat simply make a joke out of that by making cricket noises and then laughing it off   Remember you donât know everything So if you feel like he isnât interested in being with you or even just chatting right now donât take that as a personal slight Take a step back and think of every reason that might be rather than just assume that he doesnât like you Other possibilities could beHeâs shy in general or gasp nervous because heâs attracted to you too He may be distracted by something else in his life like schoolwork his job or a family situation He may just have little to say about the particular topic you bring up   Donât think all is lost just because time spent with your dream guy didnât go exactly the way you dreamt it Remember what went right and put everything else in its proper place Avoid placing too much significance on minor detailsIf he say fails to get one of your jokes or disagrees with one of your opinions donât take that to mean that you arenât funny or a good match Instead just accept that he didnât find that one particular joke funny or agree with that one particular opinion Donât assume the whole conversation was a total disaster just because it wasnât 100 perfect Remember that he may have had a perfectly good time even if you think it could have gone better

Pay attention to how the girl youâre interested in is physically acting If shes open and receptive  and her body is going along with such a way of acting  chances are shes totally into you or at least interested The same can be said for a lack of body language   Is she facing you during conversation Does she nervously laugh at your jokes Does she look you in the eye when talking If she is during all of the above sheâs definitely opening up to you and fully engaged in your conversation While this may not immediately mean shes into you shes definitely interested in the conversation as well as who shes talking to Folded arms crossed legs and fidgety hands are a sure sign of negative body language If sheâs behaving in anxious ways her mind is on something else This does not mean however that sheâs completely disinterested You can always use this as an opportunity to ask more questions Who knows she may find your inquisitiveness comforting  Eye contact is one of the most important forms of communication It reveals respect attention understanding and interest If she keeps your gaze and does not avert her attention sheâs probably interested It also means sheâs doing everything she can in order to learn more about you  Note small quirks during interactions with the girl you like If you tell a joke pay attention to the manner in which she laughs and responds If you ask a certain question see if she hesitates or chooses to dive right in These small tells often reveal a lot about a personâs interest level and overall personality   Dont make mountains out of molehills In other words donât look too far into a small quirk and misinterpret it After all people behave in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons People often perceive people in a fast but flawed way before getting to know one another Dont make the mistake of misjudging the girl you feel may be interested in you
Youll need 2 carrots 3 cucumbers 1 wedge of apple minus seeds and 1 cup of water You can leave the seeds in the cucumber Make sure you thoroughly wash the vegetation to remove any pesticides Cut it into large chunks Stick the chunks in a blender Blend the mixture until it is smooth Pour the mixture into an ice tray Make sure you cover it with plastic wrap before you freeze it Once the treats are frozen you can pop them out and put them in a plastic bag to freeze again The main purpose of freezing the treats is to preserve them However your guinea pig shouldnt eat the treat too cold as it can hurt its teeth It may also get an upset stomach Let it thaw out at room temperature in a bowl until it isnt very cold

Itâs not cute to look at your feet and mutter âumâ every few words   Keep your head up your voice strong and stay calm A quiet confidence is key It adds to your mystery Go in with no expectations Confidence is knowing youâre fine even if he says no His loss A who cares attitude puts you in control   Some girls may be able to wing it but youâre less likely to fumble or lose track of your thoughts if you have a general idea of what youâd like to say   You might try âHey Ryan We should hang out outside of school sometime Can I get your numberâ If you want to look really confident when youâre having a conversation and it starts to wind down say âThis is usually the point when a guy asks for my numberâYou may even get the added bonus of making him laugh   This can be a really effective method of getting his number but its not guaranteed It will go one of two ways   He immediately texts or calls you so you also have his number too Score He takes your number and youâre left waiting for him to contact you This can actually be good for you because if he doesnât contact you its a sign to move on Youve then spared yourself the time and possible hurt feelings in the long run   In person communication is always preferred however if heâs either not in any of your classes or you really canât bring yourself to ask him in person then writing him a note is a good alternative   Get straight to the point and write something like âHey Sam We hardly ever get to talk between classes so I wanted to give you my number so we can get in touch wheneverâ
Revenge might feel good for a moment but it can have lasting consequences Feelings of hurt can overtake you leaving you bitter angry and hostile but this doesnât mean you should retaliate Donât meet him on a low level be the bigger person and donât hurt him back Disengage from this person and donât allow him back into your life If you go to the same school it might be more difficult but cut as many ties as you can with him Donât allow him to continue manipulating or using you Create as much distance as you canDelete his number from your phone cancel connections with him on social media get rid of his email address stay away from places he might be and dont talk to him   Being used is a painful experience Remind yourself that you are worthy and valuable and no one has the right to treat you with disrespect Recognize that not every guy is out to use people and remember that good guys exist You can use this experience to recognize your own inner strength and learn from the experience No this doesnât include blaming yourself but it does mean you can be completely honest with yourself Taking responsibility is different than taking blame Taking responsibility means keeping yourself accountable and owning what actions may have contributed to a negative situation but not assuming all wrongdoing in shameIt may be most natural to feel victimized and that you had nothing to do with being used and this might be true But also reflect on if there were any factors that you contributed that made you a target Itâs okay to admit that there were things that contributed to what happened This allows you to gain insight and learn from your mistakesPerhaps you were desperate to have a boyfriend and liked that he gave you attention even though it wasnât always positive attention Maybe you were vulnerable after exiting a previous relationship and wanted to be liked by a boy   Choose to forgive him when you feel ready Holding onto bitterness can affect your next relationships and make you feel untrusting toward other guys Forgiving him releases you from your hurt and pain It also releases the role he played in your life and allows you to move on without bitternessForgiving him doesnât mean you find his actions acceptable or that youâre forgetting what happened but it means you are allowing yourself the opportunity to heal from the experienceChoose to accept what happened between the two of you then choose to not let him have any more power over you or your emotions Stop holding on to the hurt and allow yourself to start healing You may never choose to tell him you forgive him but remember that forgiving him is for you not for him   When youâre ready let go of him and the pain he caused you Write down his name and what happened including all the emotions you feel Then get rid of this paper in a way that is meaningful to you You can flush it down the toilet safely burn it or tear it up Writing down the hurt and pain and then disposing of it is a symbolic way of showing you are ready to move on and let go of the pain this caused Itâs okay to feel angry sad vengeful or rageful after a betrayal Donât bury your feelings feel free to express them even if you donât like to experience negative emotions You donât have to pretend that everything is okay and you donât have to jump to forgive himTalk to your friends or a trusted adult about what happened and how you feel Use a journal to write your feelings If words arenât your thing do art dance or listen to music Using art can help you express your feelings When youâve felt manipulated by someone remind yourself of your rights and when they are being violated You have the right to stand up for yourself and to acknowledge when you are being treated disrespectfullySome basic human rights include the right to   Be treated with respect Express your feelings and desires Say ânoâ without feeling guilty or explaining yourself Protect yourself   There is nothing wrong with you Itâs not fair to take the burden of hurt and blame entirely on your shoulders Recognize that he has his own issues and unfortunately they involved you You may not have done anything wrong and perhaps your biggest mistake was being unaware of his behavior Itâs easy to find fault in yourself or to blame yourself for what happened Yet selfblame can be a form of emotional abuse on yourselfConsider your relationship with him and ask yourself whether he was treating you with respect Did you feel good about yourself when you were with him Itâs likely he did not treat you with respect and that you are not the one to fully blameMaybe you look back and have regrets or feel bad for your decisions Keep in mind you donât know what would have happened otherwise and that you didnât have the knowledgeexperience then that you have now Remember blame doesnât fix a situation It only makes you feel worse about your decisions Realize that you cannot change your past decisions but you are capable of changing your decisions in the future Accept that absolutely everyone makes mistakes Its how we learn so be forgiving of yourself and realize that while it is painful now youll know better the next time   Being resilient means you are able to work through problems â both big and small â and bounce back easily Build your resilience by getting adequate sleep exercising and nourishing your body with good food Build your tolerance for uncertain situations and for frustration by keeping an open mind and finding positive outcomes in all situations even if they seem overwhelmingly negativeKeep a positive attitude by filtering negative thoughts blaming yourself anticipating the worst seeing things as either âall goodâ or âall badâ and engaging positive thoughts using humor putting a positive spin on situations seeing the positives in every situationKeeping your mind and body in positive states help you cope with daily struggles as well as large situations   By using self affirmations you can begin to change the negative stories you may believe in your head and start being able to handle lifeâs difficulties more easilyUsing self affirmations allows you to expand an aspect of yourself After a difficult situation like feeling used by a boy you may feel worthless or that you are not valuable Challenge these thoughts by focusing on your value and worth as true statements   First make a list of your strengths This will help give you the evidence to counter any negative thoughts about yourself Include things youre proud of your accomplishments things you are good at Things like being a good friend creative kind and good at math and so on If you have trouble ask your loved ones to contribute Now when you have the thought I am worthless you can look to all the evidence you have collected that says otherwise â think about all the people who dont feel this way about you and who value you as a friend and family member Then counter the negative thought with the affirmation I am a valuable person because I have many people in my life who value me Once you begin to feel stronger and more confident that your affirmations are true try saying them aloud or writing them down You can write them in a journal every day write them on a mirror for when you get ready in the morning or start your day by saying them out loud to yourself You may feel silly at first but stick with it You may be surprised at how they start to change your perception and your life the longer you keep with it   Keep supportive friends and family members close and donât be afraid to call someone if you need someone to talk to or need a hug Surround yourself with people that care about you and that you care about back The people in your life donât want you to suffer alone Reach out for support when you need itEven if you feel like being alone push yourself and go hang out with friends Let yourself laugh and feel good and enjoy the company of your friends Have friends that you can talk to about your problems that will listen and support you Talk to your parents or a trusted adult when you need a listening ear or you want advice This can be a teacher coach or spiritual leader
Most of the kissing that happens in middle school happens either between kids who are dating or kids who are playing kissing games To find a boyfriend or girlfriend   Think about people you already know that you might have some special feelings for Telltale signs that you like someone include being nervous or shy around them getting excited when you think about that person or see them in the halls and wanting to spend lots of time togetherSometimes people donât find love interests among their friends and if this happens to you be open to trying new activities where you might meet new people such as afterschool activities youth programs and camps If somebody asks you out donât be afraid to say yes even if you arent sure you like the person Sometimes it just takes getting to know somebody to find you have a real connection  Itâs not necessary to know this but it can be a real confidence booster if you think the person you like feels the same way It will also make it a lot easier to ask someone out if you think they like you too If somebody likes you that person mightAct nervous around you Show off in front of you Find common interests with you Like lots of things you do on Facebook and Twitter Message and text you often Steal glances at you in class in the halls or when youre out together   You cant always wait around for love to find you and sometimes you have to go out and grab it by the horns If the person youre interested in doesnât happen to ask you out take the initiative and do the asking This can be a really scary thing to do but sometimes putting yourself out there is the only way youll get what you want   Chew some gum or pop a mint in your mouth before you ask so that your breath is minty and fresh Find a time to ask the person when you two have a moment alone together and that way neither of you will feel pressure from friends Keep it casual donât be nervous and donât make a big deal about it Say something like âHey I was wondering if you would like to see a movie together sometimeâ Or âI was thinking that maybe if your free we could possibly hangoutâ Make sure you ask in person donât send a note and donât make a friend ask for you Getting a boyfriend or girlfriend can be as easy as saying yes when someone asks you out or asking someone out who says yes But once you get together with somebody itâs important to start out slow This means   Taking time to talk and learn new things about each other Holding hands sometimes Doing things together a couple times a week like going bowling playing together at recess or having lunch or dinner together   Knowing when youre ready to take big steps in life can be hard and kissing someone for the first time is one of those big steps If youre wondering if youre ready to kiss someone ask yourselfDo you think about kissing this person a lot Do you have strong feelings for this person Are you comfortable around this person Does the thought of kissing this person make you happy and excited If you answered yes to all or most of these questions youâre likely ready to kiss that special someone   When youre ready to experience a kiss with your partner there are two things you can do either wait to be kissed or initiate the kiss yourself If youd rather wait to be kissed there are ways you can show that youre ready includingWhen you hug hold on a little tighter than usual and rest your head on your partnerâs shoulder Make lots of eye contact Smile a lot Try to find excuses to get close Touch your hair as this is a sign of flirting   You can also choose to initiate the kiss yourself and there are signs you can look for that will demonstrate that your partner is ready to kiss as well These includeMaking eye contact with you Making excuses to get close or touch you Complimenting you often Blushing or laughing a lot around you Chewing gum all the time   Sharing a kiss is something that most people like to do in private so finding the right time to kiss can be important For instance when you pass in the hall in between classes probably isnt the best time to do it There are lots of places where first kisses happen includingBowling alleys At the movies A school dance On a school trip At camp On the bus   Kissing somebody can make you really nervous but itâs important to stay as calm as you can in order to avoid sweating excessively throwing up or getting too scared and not going through with it Ways you can keep calm are   Have a plan about when and where youre going to do it Donât rush yourself If you arent actually ready you might feel extremely nervous before a kiss and this could be your brainâs way of saying you arent ready Donât make too big a deal out of it When youre going to do something that scares you it can be easy to make it seem like a much bigger deal than it is and this can make you even more nervous Have your plan ready and then keep your mind off the kiss until youre ready to do it   Figuring out what another person wants based on signals is hard and itâs easy to misinterpret what people want just based on body language To avoid making a mistake simply ask your partner before going in for the kiss   You can say something like âMay I kiss youâ or âHow about we kiss nowâ Donât worry about thinking that asking might ruin the mood Your partner will appreciate that youre being respectful and considerate and that you want the moment to be special for you both   When the time comes and youre both ready just go for it Sit or stand close enough that you can reach your partner without straining Look your partner in the eye and tilt your head to one side If your partner tilts to the other side close your eyes and lean in for the kiss   Pucker your lips slightly and with your mouth closed press your lips against your partnerâs gently but firmlyYou want to close your eyes before the kiss because keeping your eyes open can give the impression that youre dishonest   Playing a kissing game at a party can be a good way to get a kiss This method also works if youre trying to get a kiss from a crush that you donât think feels the same way about you To play spin the bottle   Gather a group of at least four to six people and get everyone to sit in a circle Place an empty bottle in the center of the circleDraw straws pick the oldest person or find some other way to determine who goes first The person who goes first will spin the bottle When the bottle stops the tip will be pointing at someone and the spinner has to kiss that person The person who got kissed spins next and so the game continues   Seven minutes is another kissing game but in this one the two people selected to kiss are sent to a closet alone together for seven minutes During their time in the closet it is expected that the two people will be kissing   Sit everyone in a circle and place a bottle in the center Have somebody spin the bottle When the bottle stops the tip will be facing one person and the end will be pointing to another Those two people are sent to the closet for seven minutes When they emerge the bottle is spun again and the game continues   In this game a piece of paper is passed around a circle from person to person via the mouth and nobody is allowed to use their hands To play this gameSit all the players in a circle Usually players arrange themselves in a boygirlboygirl pattern Take a small piece of paper such as a business card The player who starts will press the paper up to his or her mouth suck air in through the mouth to hold the paper in place and remove the hands The player with the paper then turns to the person on the left and presses the paper onto the mouth of that person As they connect the person passing the paper exhales to release the paper and the person whoâs accepting the paper sucks air in to secure the paper to the mouth The paper gets passed around the circle in this way and the idea is that when the paper gets dropped by accident the two people passing it will end up kissing
The most effective way to keep your guinea pig safe from the hot heat is to move them from outdoors to indoors if they arent already inside The temperature of the whole area already helps them stay cool especially if you have fans or air conditioning  A good place to keep your guinea pig is in the laundry room or bathroom as these are one of the coolest rooms in the house Make sure heshe is safe from any other pets and younger children Resist from turning the washing machine or dryer on at this time as guinea pigs are sensitive to loud noise and the generator will give off heat and humidity  Avoid any direct sunlight that can instantly heat up the cage The housing your guinea pigs live in can help to be cooled down if you keep them in the shade such as a tree or under the roofing  If you cant physically move your guinea pigs cage into the shade you should opt for bringing them indoors or at least putting a parasol over the cage You will need to check on your guinea pigs more often however   The heat can be two times worse in these places as the humidity level rises These areas dont hold a good air flow or ventilation so they trap the heat in Housing your guinea pig in a shed or garage can lead to death so please take caution Your guinea pigs should be kept away from any direct sunlight on them Dont place them near any windows where the sun can directly shine on their cage You can help get rid of sun seeping through by covering the windows or closing the curtainsblinds Water can evaporate or even heat up fast in hot weather Guinea pigs will refuse to drink warm water if there is any Top up water at least three times on a hot day and feel it to make sure its staying at a cool room temperature Due to the weather conditions water is very important to keep your guinea pigs hydrated and prevent any potential issues from occurring You can help your guinea pig get plenty of water through providing more than one water source The more guinea pigs the more water you will need Some guinea pigs dont like sharing as they can be territorial Opt for vegetables that have a higher water content such as cucumbers and berries which will help to ease discomfort in high heat You can alternatively choose to feed frozen vegetables if you wish  Dont overdo it Only feed a few high water content vegetables This doesnt mean that you should go overboard and feed your guinea pigs a complete diet that only contains vegetables that contain a lot of water Your guinea pig still needs to be getting nutrients from their vegetables These items are a yes when it comes to using them to keep your guinea pigs cool But point the direction away from the guinea pigs instead of directly onto them They can help cool the air but there is no need to have them directed at the guinea pigs which can stress them out Frozen water bottles ice packs gel cushions and cool tiles can all be placed inside of your guinea pigs cage to help insulate cold air and allow somewhere cool for your guinea pig to rest besidePlastic water bottles can be filled with water and then frozen overnight Wrap them in old chilled tea towels or flannels and place them into the cage Old tiles can be placed in the freezer to cool overnight and then put inside of the cage for your guinea pig to rest on or near Chilled gel packs can also be used as long as your guinea pigs wont chew them   Hot weather is the time you should be concerned about your guinea pigs health from heat stress to dehydration Long haired breeds can easily suffer from heat stroke due to the insulation from their longer coat Short haired breeds are less prone however Your long haired guinea pig should be monitored closely If you want to lighten the heat stress on your guinea pig consider trimming its coat and keeping it well groomed Guinea pigs like to hide away from the sun which helps reduce their stress levels Ensure your guinea pig has access to some hide away or huts but avoid anything made from plastic which can heat up quickly The dampness can help insulate cool air in the cage and ultimately reduce heat stress Rinse the cloth in ice cold water and make sure you drain it off afterwards Dont place the cloth over the food bowl which can spoil the pellets and only cover part of the cage to ensure that you can see the guinea pigs and they can see you
Inspire a girlâs confidence in you by giving her your complete attention during a conversation Make direct eye contact nod and react while she is talking and repeat things back to her to convey that you are listening This will work to make you look charismatic and empathetic to herFor example if she is telling you about her current project at work interject with positive comments like I can imagine that involves a lot of commitment or It sounds like you have great time management skills  Women respond to humour and appreciate people who can make them laugh Laughter may also reduce shyness or defensiveness and make her feel comfortable with you Tell a joke do an impression or share a funny anecdote about yourself to make her feel happy and at ease Bring up your skills and hobbies in a tactful way to impress her without seeming arrogant Wait for the conversation to lead there naturally or ask her about her interests or hidden talents to set up the topic Interesting talents or pastimes will make you seem more intriguing and dynamicFor instance talk about your surfing skills by saying something like Its a fun and challenging activity Ive been devoting a lot of time and practice to getting better at it   Create a rapport by looking for connections between the two of you Shared interests hobbies or experiences can forge a bond between people Ask questions until she reveals an aspect of life that you share then highlight that mutual connectionFor instance if she mentions a love of zombie movies express your appreciation for the genre by telling her your own favorite films

As the old saying goes âDonât judge a book by its coverâ If you decide you donât like your teenâs date shortly after introductions your opinion could be misguided Donât jump to conclusions by judging their date prematurely Instead take the time to actually get to know who they are dating   Then you can decide if the date is a positive partner for your teen Plus trying to get to know them shows your teen that you are making an effort Invite your teenâs new date over for a family game night or intimate barbecue Make a point to assess their interactions with your teen and the rest of the familyHowever keep in mind that one interaction is not enough to get a good idea of who the person is It may take several interactions before you have a good sense of their character   As an adult you still want to be a positive role model Even though you may not like your teenâs date act appropriately by treating the person with kindness and respect Keep in mind that how you treat the person reflects on your child and your family as whole Greet them and ask about their wellbeing when you are in their presence   Furthermore some teens choose unsavory dates to push their parentâs buttons If you are civil with the date and refuse to act inappropriately this may diminish the power of any acting out behaviors   Itâs perfectly fine to get to know your teenâs date on a personal level but draw the line at fullon grilling Plus your child will be humiliated if you initiate an interrogation of their date   If you intimidate the date or your teen they are more likely to keep their relationship on the downlow in the future which is something you donât want to happen Stick to the basics like âWho are your parentsâ or âWhere are you fromâ You can gradually get more information about a new date during future visits   Despite your instincts signaling that this person is a bad choice for your teen try to get some perspective Your initial instinct could be wrong and you could be harshly judging a decent person   Take a step back and try to see from your teenâs point of view What is it that you think they like about this person Do they have any redeeming qualitiesYou might even discuss this with your child by saying something like âYou know I can see what you like about Jessica She has a great sense of humorâ
If you are not about to ride you may put the saddle on another surface of the same height Face the saddle with the stirrups hanging down  If the buckle isnt already in this position grasp the part of the stirrup leather closest to the saddle Pull downward until you hear the buckle click against the stirrup bar   If your fingertips reach the buckle when your left arm is fully outstretched the stirrup leather should be close to your ideal length If not use the buckle to lengthen or shorten the leather   Place your right hand on the stirrup iron Place your left hand on the buckle reaching along the stirrup leather and under the saddles skirt   Switch the left and right if you are lefthanded   Pull the stirrup toward your left arm until it touches against you The exact position depends on what type of riding youll be doing   If you will be jumping the stirrup should reach your left armpit For dressage the stirrup should touch your first ribs For ordinary riding the stirrup should be somewhere between these positions or touch our left arm just in front of your armpit   If the stirrup does not reach you or feels slacked when brought to this position adjust the stirrup leather to a different hole Repeat these steps until the stirrup is in the correct position   Count the number of holes you moved so you can do the same with the stirrup on the opposite side If the holes are numbered just make a mental note of the number   Move to the opposite side of the horse and adjust the stirrups using the same process This ensures that your stirrups are roughly the same length before you mount   Sit in the saddle with your legs hanging down comfortably outside the stirrups For ordinary riding the bottom of the stirrup iron should hit the middle of your ankle bone   Ride with slightly shorter stirrups when jumping to help take your weight out of the saddle when in jumping position Ride with slightly longer stirrups for schooling or dressage in order to have closer lower leg contact with your horse   If the iron is not in the correct place lift the skirt covering the buckle Pull the stirrup leather up a few inches several centimeters through the stirrup bar Buckle again into a higher or lower hole on the stirrup leather as needed then pull the part of the leather closest to the saddle down again You should hear the buckle click up against the stirrup bar   Keep your feet out of the stirrup irons during this adjustment   Make sure the leather lies smooth not twisted between your leg and the saddle flap Turn your toes into the stirrup iron then forward Alternatively grasp the iron with your hand and turn it outwards just enough to slip your foot in The bend of your knee should be comfortable against the knee roll Your heels should naturally sink slightly below the level of your toes when the ball your foot is resting on the stirrup iron   When rotating the stirrup by hand move the left stirrup anticlockwise and the right stirrup clockwise   If youre not sure ask your horse to stand at a square halt on a flat surface without resting a hind hoof Ask someone to stand in front of your horse and check whether the stirrups look the same length or need further adjustment Its important to have them as even as possible so that your position in the saddle is centered and your weight is evenly distributed Uneven stirrups can cause the horse discomfort and muscle damage

While youâre avoiding him or ignoring him you need to consider ways to resolve the situation because he isnât going to suddenly disappear How do you feel about him What do you want your relationship to look like Think about what you specifically want out of a relationship whether it is friendship or something more   If itâs someone you know well and see a lot heâs probably unavoidable and hard to ignore If you find yourself getting worked up over seeing him try some relaxation methods such as stretching out and taking a deep breath Remind yourself it is all a passing thing Some situations might take a lot of time to work out This might mean that you confess your feelings openly to find that he feels the same way Or it might mean that he doesnât feel the same way Or that you both feel the same way but still want to be friends and take it easy
Pay attention to the scenario and mold your invitation to the circumstances Dont for example ask her a random astronomy question when shes shopping for shoes Here are a different ways to accomplish this   If you want to strike up a conversation with a girl you dont know try making a recommendation For example if you see a beautiful girl at a coffee shop and she looks undecided about her order then recommend your favorite drink or tell her that youre going to guess exactly what she wants just by looking at her When you already know the girl start with some common ground If youre in school together then make a comment about classes or talk about your extra curricular activities If youre working together then start a chat about some workplace news or ask for her help with something that youre working on Ask her for a minor favor For example ask her to watch your stuff like your phone while you go get her something to drink Girls will feel more interested in you if theyve done a favor for you It will also make them feel trustworthy and maybe even curiousPay her a compliment If she looks great that day or if she said something amazing during class then tell her so Compliment her hair or her smile or her dress Stay away from her more feminine features Make sure your compliment is genuine and not phony  You want to show her that youre interested in her while at the same time deciding whether shes really worth your interestA great question will make her think laugh and like you all at the same time   Avoid yes and no questions A question like Did you like the new movie that came out this weekend will get you either a yes or a no but may not launch a meaningful conversation Instead ask her what other movies shes seen and why she likes them This type of question will get a much longer answer from her Girls often like guys to make the first move Instead of waiting for her to ask you questions be proactive and do the asking first Once shes answered your question nod and then provide your own perspective You want a balanced conversation in which you find out what shes all about while also sharing parts of yourself Find out what shes passionate about If you like this girl then chances are you find something about her really fascinating Ask her why she likes what she likes or why she thinks what she thinks Ask her something that you genuinely want to learn more about instead of asking questions just to get her to talk If youre insincere shell know and your conversation will be dead in the water  People love to talk about themselves If you find out what shes passionate about the conversation will go naturally and easily This is the easiest way to build a connection     You want to find out as much as you can about her but you also want to make sure that you show yourself at your best   Talk about a subject that makes you feel passionate and persuasive When youre talking about something really positive youre going to be at your best If youre passionate about music then talk about your favorite bands If you have something that you love to do then talk about it with her Make sure that you give her equal time You definitely want to share something about yourself but if you only talk about you shes going to think youre selfcentered and shes not going to talk to you Dont offer opinions about subjects you know nothing about Your goal is to impress the girl with your wit your conversation and your intelligence If you blather about something youre opinionated but uninformed about you wont come off as very intelligent   Youre not going to be able to think of something to say at every point during the conversation and thats completely okay Pauses are a natural part of conversation Get her comfortable with the idea of pauses by using pauses or deliberations sparingly in your own speech   Smile at her take a sip from your drink or look around the room until you come up with something new to say As long as you seem confident and interested shell wait with a lot of anticipation for the next step in the conversation If you look nervous or stare at your feet then shell feel uncomfortable and shes likely to say see you later Use pauses throughout the conversation When you pause look as though you are carefully considering what you want to say Shell be invested in trying to find out what youre going to say next and she may feel compelled to fill the silence with her own conversation Peoples rate of speech naturally synchronizes when theyre talking That means that people unconsciously mimic how quickly the other person is talking So if you talk slowly shell talk slowly and the conversation will last longer The secret to talking slowly is being confident not nervous Think of the pauses as her chance to impress you Dont feel like you need to generate topic after topic for conversation During the pause you want to silently invite her to take the initiative If she does then youll know that shes enjoying talking to you Dont delve into any controversial subjects or anything that she may find uncomfortable Also dont gossip about other people because she may think that youre not genuinely nice   Use your sense of humor Dont dive in with a really offcolor joke or something that could be shocking to her Keep it light and test the waters before you say anything that she might think is mean or offensive Practice funny stories More than simply jokes people love hearing stories about funny things that happened to you So keep track of funny or entertaining things that happened to you and rehearse the story you want to tell with friends Know your pop culture Keep up on the latest celebrity news and whats new in movies and music When you know whats going on out there youll always have something light to talk about Plus you might just impress her with the number of things that you know   For yourself use great eye contact sit up straight and smile warmly When you do these things shell feel as though youre focused on her   Watch the way she uses her body If she makes eye contact with you lightly touches your arm or leans in toward you while youre talking then you can feel confident that shes into you Make sure youre projecting good body language too Dont cross your arms tap your feet sigh or groan audibly All these tics are signs that youre bored or dissatisfied with her If shes constantly looking away fiddling with her drink or her jewelry or looking like she cant wait to escape then you may be losing her interest You can try saying something like Are you having a bad day You look like youre a million miles away Or if the conversation hasnt been all that interesting to begin with just politely say Nice talking to you and walk away   Let her know that you think shes important Dont be cagey about turning the spotlight on you Instead focus it mainly on her   Turn off your cell phone while youre having a conversation with a girl If you go outside to take a call you may come back and find that shes moved on If you run into friends introduce your friends to her but remain focused on your conversation Try to send nonverbal signals to your friends letting them know that they need to talk to you another time   Tell her that you enjoyed talking to her and getting to know her If you felt a real connection to her ask for her phone number The next morning send her a text saying that you had a great time and wish her a good day You might get a second chance at continuing that initial conversation if she texts you back   A good rule of thumb is to wait a least a day before you call her especially if you approached her as a stranger You dont want her to think youre too forward and you dont want to appear too needy so it is best to delay for a day When you call her keep things short and sweet Unless shes really enjoying the conversation simply ask her if shed want to see a movie or go out for coffee and leave it at that You want to impress her in person where you can do better damagecontrol if something goes wrong Keep it low key until you know that she really likes you She may feel a bit weird if youre pushing really hard and shes not so try to get a good balance going And at all times keep the conversation flowing

It is most likely that monkeys will be attracted to residential areas if they think they can access food easily Before you think about installing any alarms or security devices to repel moneys you should make sure you are not encouraging them to enter your neighbourhood The first thing to do is check that there are no open or inadequately secured bins which monkeys can gain easy access toUse monkeyproof bins which can be properly secured and will not attract monkeys You can secure bin lids with an elastic strap or bungee cordTie all refuse bags with a doubleknot and make sure that no food waste is left lying around or spilling out of the bins Having easily accessible food in rubbish areas will encourage monkeys to move further into residential areas and even enter houses  As well as ensuring that food waste and rubbish areas are closed off and monkeyproofed it is essential that you and your neighbours do not feed monkeys in the area If the monkeys get fed they will come back looking for more food You can try to cut off their access to human sources of food so they continue to forage in their natural habitat not in urban areasDo not feed monkeys or any other wild animals or you will attract them to where you live and make repelling them much harderPreventing and discouraging the monkeys from entering human settlements is the most important first step Once monkeys know there is a food source they are likely to visit every day If you have fruit trees around your house or in your neighbourhood dont forget that these are a potential food source that could attract monkeys You should harvest any fruit trees as soon as possible in order to reduce the chances of monkeys finding the fruitIf this is a consistent problem consider whether you should continue to cultivate fruit trees   If you are growing vegetables in the ground be sure to cover them with a strong wire mesh that is designed to resist primates As well as securing all the bins it is also important not to make it easy for monkeys to enter your house to look for food To do this ensure that all windows are secured You can simply close the windows or monkeyproof them with a mesh coveringMeshing a window and keeping food out of sight will discourage curious monkeys If you have monkeys in the area you should avoid using plastic bags as much as possible when you are walking around Put any plastic bags inside canvas bags instead Monkeys are curious and will snatch plastic bags which have food in and forage through rubbish bags They can easily tear through the plastic so ensure they do not have the opportunity If you live in an area that borders the edge of a forest where monkeys live its important that you make sure your neighbours understand what to do to discourage monkeys from entering your residential area If you secure the bins close windows and dont feed the monkeys but other people arent so vigilant the problem wont be solved Be sure to speak to your neighbours and explain how discouraging monkeys is the most effective way to deal with it   Education and awareness raising are essential for longterm solutions to be successful You need everyone to buy in and take responsibility
Show him you are wellgroomed and put together by ensuring you maintain good hygiene Shower every day make sure you brush and floss at least twice a day and present a clean appearance You can let an older guy know that you can be mature and put together by choosing outfits and clothing that appear more adult Go for outfits that project maturity rather than a childish or teenager look   A big part of acting mature is being able to own your own sense of style based on your tastes and preferences Donât expect to wake up one day and have personal sense of style Instead let your sense of style evolve as you evolve As you grow older your taste in clothing will change over time It may help to focus on a certain style of dressing like surfer girl style or ladylike style and then tailor it to fit your personality and your tastes   One way you can develop your own sense of style is to find an older style icon and emulate their style This could be a classic film star like Carey Grant or Grace Kelly or it could be your mother or fatherâs style in the 70s or 80s Look at how your style icon dresses and carries themselves Try to find clothing that has a similar cut or look and style yourself after an older style icon If youâre trying to create an outfit for a night out you should think about dressing mature and still true to yourself This could mean higher necklines and lower hemlines but also an element that is true to your personality or sense of style like a cool necklace or a vintage coat The idea is to project confidence and maturity with how you wear your clothing rather than what you are wearing   Show the older guy that you have a strong intellect by reading up on current events and pop culture You can then bring up current events in conversation when you are around the older guy or on a date with him You should try to have a wellinformed opinion about local and global issues and be willing to engage in conversation that is interesting and engaging  You can become wellversed in current events and pop culture by reading articles online and in print in magazines newspapers and journals You can also watch videos online about pop culture and world issues so you are armed with lots of intelligent information you can discuss with the older guy   Take pride in your skills and abilities at school or at work and donât be afraid to discuss them with the older guy If you are a star student in a particular subject or an ace employee at the office brag and let the older guy know that you are in control and in charge in a certain area of your life This will show him you have skills and abilities that you excel in Your confidence and skills will surely impress him and make him more interested in you as a person  One way you can show off your skills or abilities is to invite him to an event or setting that will allow you to demonstrate them This could be an art show displaying your artwork a sporting event where he can watch you play or an office event where you can show off how wellregarded you are among your coworkers You can also share this information in conversation by asking the older guy what he is most proud of or asking him about his skills and abilities He may then reciprocate by asking you about your skills and abilities thereby allowing you to share them without appearing cocky or egotistical For example you could suggest Lets talk about things we are proud of or ask him What do you feel you are good at   If you know you and the older guy share certain topics or interests in common you should focus your conversation around these interests This could be a shared interest in science fiction novels or a sports team or perhaps a shared experience of backpacking through Asia alone Think about topics that you can bring up that will encourage interesting conversation and a feeling of connection between you and the older guy   You can also plan dates or get togethers that focus on a topic or activity of interest like going to see a favorite author read at a bookstore or going to watch a hockey game of a team you both love This will show the older guy that you are trying to create experiences that you will both enjoy and that you are mature enough to consider his needs as well as yours   Try not to put on an act or pretend to be someone you are not around the older guy Though you may try to impress the older guy by being someone you are not it can be difficult to maintain the act and over time you may slip up or not be able to keep pretending Avoid giving the guy a false sense of yourself and start the relationship on an honest straightforward note Be forthcoming and yourself around the guy so you appear confident and selfaware to him This will likely impress him more than a false representation of yourself   Impress the older guy with your ability to be a good listener and practice active listening Active listening is the process of viewing every conversation as a learning opportunity where you can get to know someone better or learn something new from someone else When you actively listen to someone speak they can tell you are interested in what they are saying and are skilled at sincere and engaging conversation  Do active listening with the older guy by asking him about his day and then listening to him fully as he speaks Listen without interrupting but show you are engaged by nodding and maintaining eye contact with him Once he is finished speaking repeat back what he said in your own words such as âI think you meanââ or âWhat I hear you saying isââ You can also offer advice or comment on what he tells you Be thoughtful and take your time when you respond to him as this will show him you take his words seriously and can be a good active listener   Avoid bottling up your feelings and emotions or being passive aggressive about your emotions These are both signs of immaturity and an inability to be emotionally open Older guys can have more developed emotional maturity due to their age and experience so meet him halfway by being willing to share your feelings if you are upset or bothered by something or someone This means also being honest with him if he does something that annoys you or makes you uncomfortable as this will show him you can be confident and straightforwardKeeping your feelings and emotions to yourself may seem like an easy to avoid conflict and appear relaxed and easygoing especially if you are trying to appear cool and collected to an older guy But being dishonest about your feelings will only lead to conflict later on and less trust between you and the older guy If the older guy is as mature as he seems he will react to your honesty with compassion and gratitude For example if the older guy does something that upsets you rather than get upset and start a screaming match or give him the silent treatment you can respond by suggesting that you both discuss the issue and try to resolve it together If he forgets your birthday for example you may tell him Im sure you didnt mean to be hurtful but when you forgot my birthday I felt really hurt It felt like you didnt value a day thats important to me Can we talk about it   Another big turn on for older guys is a partner who is not overly needy or insecure Show him that you can be independent and self sufficient so that he comes to see you as his equal rather than a younger inexperienced partnerThis means not calling or texting him all day every day or insisting that you spend every minute together You should cultivate your own friend group and stay connected to your family and friends even if you become involved with the older guy This will illustrate your independence and likely lead to a healthier relationship Do things on your own occasionally like going to a concert or seeing a movie Knowing that you can have fun by yourself will make you more confident which is impressive to older guys
Looking into his eyes is an intimate gesture and communicates that youre comfortable with him   Take advantage of small opportunities to make eye contact before you kiss him Look at him across a crowded room or find reasons to glance over at him if youre sitting together Lock eyes just before he kisses you A sustained gaze as you move closer will let him know that youre interested Just dont forget to close your eyes the second before you kiss him  Make yourself an active participant in the kiss instead of just sitting there and passively allowing him to kiss you   Move your lips Avoid the dreaded dead fish pose by moving your lips gently open and closed along with the kiss Just try to avoid smacking noises and pay attention to your partners cues on tempo â if he noticeably slows down or speeds up follow along French kiss him back If hes started French kissing you and youre OK with that be an equal partner Instead of allowing his tongue to linger in your mouth venture your own tongue out   Small hand motions can show him youre interested and make the kiss more intense Try these positions   Tangle them in his hair Run them over his shoulders Cradle the sides of his face Rest them on his chest or waist   Nothing will make him feel more amazing than knowing you enjoyed the kiss so show it Smile breathlessly tell him That was amazing and look into his eyes again He wont have any doubt that you meant it
When you see your crush extend a friendly greeting Smile and make eye contact with your crush Once youâve locked eyes exchange âHellosâ with your crush   Donât try to force the conversation If your crush says âhelloâ and keeps walking donât chase after them Your crush may not be interested in talking to you or they may be heading somewhere in a hurry  After saying âHelloâ strike up a conversation by asking your crush a question You may choose to pose a generic stock question ask them a school related question or tailor the question to your crushâs interests and activities   Stock questions include âHow are you doingâ âWhat are you doing over breakâ âWere you at the game last nightâ âDo you work at _____â School related questions include âDid we have homework in English classâ âDo you want to study for the test togetherâ âWhat did you think about the quizâ âDo you need help with the Math homeworkâ Personalized questions include âHow did you play in the game last nightâ âHave you ever seen insert bandâs name perform liveâ â âWhat are you doing this weekendâ âAre you going to the partyâ âHow was your vacationâ After asking the question remain focused on your crush Actively listen to their reply so that you can extend the conversation with another question or personal story As you listen make a concentrated effort to appear genuinely interested in what your crush has to sayâwhen you remain engaged in a conversation people are more willing to keep talkingSet aside all potential distractions like your phone and computer Make mental notes of potential followup questions or relevant personal stories to share After your crush has responded to your initial question both you and your crush have the ability to carry on the conversation If your crush asks you a question take a moment to reply to their question and then pose another question of your own If your crush does not ask you a question you have three options ask a followup question share a relevant personal story or end the conversation   Continue asking each other questions telling jokes and exchanging stories until one or both of you decide to end the conversation During a conversation the information you share about yourself is just as revealing as the questions you ask others When talking about yourself keep the conversation positiveânegativity and bragging are unflattering qualities You should also strive to keep the conversation balancedâgive your crush a chance to talk   Dont spend the entire conversation boasting about your latest accomplishments and avoid exclusively discussing your laundry list of failures Instead discuss your passions your interests and your dreams for the future Your crush will come to see how awesome you are Asking thoughtful questions demonstrates that you are caring considerate and genuinely interested in your crush Body language is an extremely effective and powerful form of communication You can use these nonverbal gestures to express your feelings and flirt with your crush   Maintain eye contact with your crush Your eyes can convey a variety of feelings from love and lust to interest and attraction Mirror their body language and facial reactions Nod occasionally to let your crush know you are listening Initiate appropriate contact by touching your crush on the arm or shoulder occasionally Remain aware of your gestures and facial expressions If your facial expression and gestures dont match the sentiment of your words you run the risk of sending mixed messages to your crush
If you notice anyone else you might like go for it Try to broaden your horizons and not obsess over himThis can help you to realize that hes probably not as great as you thought  Even if its not just the three of you alone Hell think youre weird and could figure out you like him   That way youll be more relaxed around her and him when all of you are together   Itll matter even more to you what he thinks about you because youre friends and youve probably already accepted advice and opinions from himJust ask someone else some of the things youd usually ask himThis will help you to get a fresh new perspective on things   You never know she could have some experience in your dilemma Nothing beats another girls advice just make sure youre asking the right person   Dont make him out to be a terrible person just think of a little thing that kind of annoys you or turns you off whenever you think this about him   You probably have something else to think about besides your guy friend 247 If hes in your classesactivitiesoffice maybe even a team you can still do other things without him Do something with a friend or friends try new things get involved in something   Although its hard to think of him as just a friend you can still do things together You are friends rightYou have to remember that you were and still are friends with him even if you do like him
Does he try to touch you Even just little touches relatively frequently could indicate he likes you   Do you ever find him poking you or tickling you If so this is called flirting 101 Touch is a useful way to tell if a guy likes you because guys flirt with girls they dont even like all the time depending on who they are So if he tickles or touches you he is obviously flirting  Looking sheepish or pretending to think every time you catch him looking at you is a sign of interest Do you ever glance over at him and catch him staring at you If you do there is hope that he likes you But it also depends on how often you catch him looking or how long you do Dont give up yet   If you catch him looking at you every day in every class multiple times for more than three seconds youre in luck Usually if he likes you he will stare a you for a bit and not lose eye contact after a few seconds and will continuously do it If you catch him looking at you for a couple seconds but he looks away this is still a good sign as long as he does it more than once If he only looks at you for a second but turns away during one class he probably has no feelings for you He is probably just looking around If he looks away and smiles this could mean he likes you If he keeps looking and laughs after this could also mean he likes you   If he is smiling at you a lot this is a great sign of fondness   It is a positive sign if the guy you like tells a lot of jokes near you Usually this means that the guy wants to be near you Also notice if he is near members of your group in science class for example and he all of the sudden talks to them a lot This means he wants to get an excuse to get closer to you   If a guy really likes you he will usually try to find ways to talk to you even goofy ways   Remember that guys often have a hard time talking to girls because theyre nervous If he stutters or gives awkward replies it could be a sign that he likes you   Do you ever find him butting into your conversations with a friend This could mean he is trying to spark a conversation with you and wants to talk Let him Joke around a bit to let him know you accept him   Is he coming up often and talking to your friends but not necessarily you He may be working his way around to you and using your friends as the excuse to be near   If he sits beside you or somewhere close and then tries to talk to you this is a good sign   If he starts showing up where ever you are he may be following you to find a good time to talk to you   Have you ever found him trying to race or compete with you in gym class This is also an obvious way to tell if guys like you He will probably try to catch up with you and give you sarcastic comments that make you want to beat him This competitiveness will be a great way to show him what you got and flirt at the same time   Asking you to be his partner in class or to come over and study could mean he likes you or it could mean he is picking your brains for his assignment so do be careful here Furthermore if you decline and he later denies having anything to do with asking you he may be interested   For example If there is a math problem that he couldnt do or any other example and he gets up and comes to you even if he could have gotten the answer from someone else such as his best friend this is an indication that he likes you   If he overreacts when you spend time with another guy it might be a sign of his interest in you Beware though if hes a controlling type an overreaction is not a sign of affection but one of control   Does he ever get angry or upset when you are talking to or are fooling around with other boys Does he give you looks This could mean that he is jealous This is also another obvious way to tell if he likes you By seeing another guy with you he wishes it could be him talking and laughing to you   You can often find out if a guy likes you by looking him straight in the eyes and asking him if he likes you If he blushes smiles slightly or says nothing this could mean he likes you Try it
Various social media applications allow you to tag your location so thereâs a chance your crush might have tagged their home   Look at Instagram mapsInstagram allows you to tag your location so go to their profile and check their maps for the places theyâve taken the most pictures Start with the selfies as these are likely to have been taken at their home Check out their pictures If you live in a smaller town see if you notice any familiar landmarks If your crush has a picture with their house in the background look closely to see if you recognize it See where theyâve checked in Look at their Facebook to see if they use apps like FoursquareThis probably wonât lead you to their address However by seeing the places they frequent you might get an idea of the area of your city that they live in   School or church directories often list the contact information of their members These may be digital or physical directories Look for them by their last name   This will make it easier to find out where your crush lives Use online and physical phone booksIf you donât know the full names of your crushâs parents look on Facebook Chances are that you kind find them by looking for people with the same last name as your crush in their friends list
If you are serious about wanting to get to know this person social media can help you out a bit Its okay to check them out online but choose one social media platform to reach out to them on Add the person you like on Facebook or Snapchat or follow them on Instagram  Once they have added you back or accepted your request say hi Commenting is important because they probably get friend or follow requests from many people and youll be able to distinguish yourself from them this way Bring attention to yourself in a lowkey way by commenting on a recent picture something like I like this or This looks cool A compliment is usually good but dont think too hard If its Snap Chat send them a picture  say hi or ask them whats up People appreciate other people who are interested in their lives so make sure you genuinely care about this persons life         If you see the person you like every day or at least once a week try to nod at them in the hallways or say Good morning at work or wherever you see them Start with these and slowly motivate yourself to talk to them more and more   For example if you are in a certain class together ask them what the homework is If its Monday ask them how their weekend was Make sure you say it loud enough for them to hear and start by saying their name This person might not recognize your voice or might think youre talking to someone else so say their name before you start your conversation Start by asking one question then try asking two next time then three etc Let the conversation flow naturally and if it stops be the one to end it You could say Okay thanks Ill see you around or It was nice talking to you or whatever you see fit for your situation If youre still really scared to talk to them at this point dont freak out Take your time and slowly at your own pace become more comfortable talking to them Smiling helps too   If you talk to them often online and have the occasional real life chat chances are you will get to know them a lot better If they tell you the date of their birthday send them a little happy birthday message or even tell them in real life If there is a gift you want to give them but youre too shy to do it face to face leave it on their desk or in their lockeror wherever else theyll find itin a secret admirer way   Also if they have an interest try to remember and show your support for it For example if they have a sport they like or a team they follow check the teams game schedule and ask the person what they thought of their teams last game Knowing that someone else pays attention to their likes and dislikes really strengthens the bond between people naturally If there is an artist they like you can ask them what their favorite songs are This person will appreciate how much you care about them as a person   The goal for this phase is to become more comfortable around this person you so greatly admire Part of that requires you to stretch a bit and tell them a bit about yourself casually in conversation You dont have to tell them your deepest darkest secrets but answer questions honestly If they like a certain type of music that you arent familiar with be honest and let them know you havent heard of that band or artist If there is a movie you absolutely find hilarious tell them Little spontaneous conversations about likes and dislikes is a really good way to know this person better and let them know who you are Yay youre slowly becoming more comfortable with this person   As you become more comfortable with this person your friends will want to know them too Introduce them or hang out with mutual friends This doesnt necessarily mean your squads have to become a mass group of BFFs or little group of BFFs but at least get to know his or her friends as individuals This doesnt mean that you willor shouldknow every last person that has ever talked to your crush rather find people they are friends with that you can also relate to click to read this really cool article on how to Make Friends when You Are Not Social If there isnt anyone they are friends with who you connect with that is okay too   Avoid using people to talk to this person or only interact with people to impress the person you like Remember you are friends with the person you like on your own terms Dont befriend their squad just so you can get to them rather befriend them because you actually want to be friends with them People are individuals and all deserve legitimate friends remember Cut out the middleman    If you want to watch a movie that you know the person you like wants to watch feel free to grab a friend or two and invite them to do the same The bigger the group the more comfortable you may be but try to make it still intimate Inviting mutual friends who might be interested in the group activity is also key Look at you hanging out with your crush   You now have several mutual friends and have hung out with the person of your interest more than twice outside a professional or school setting Now you are less shy around them and can be yourself Time to challenge yourself again hang out oneonone once in a while Find some things that the two of you have in common and do those things together Talk to them even when the group isnt together or even when theiryour other friends arent around This will let them know subconsciously that you value them as an individual This can also make them think âDo I like them Do they like me Or do I just like hanging out with themâ Having some insider jokes is a definite plus Dont worry this will not make anything too obvious this will just get you both thinking about each other separated from the group Once you get a feeling of where they are at and if they like you back then proceed to the third and last phase of this plan   Be careful to avoid ditching your old friends or making the person you like ditch theirs Let friends know ahead of time when you are busy and make sure you still spend time with your pals whenever you can If they are romantically involved with someone else dont hang out oneonone at all outside a professional setting ie work school etc especially if you are the one initiating it This might come across very wrong and actually end up being detrimental to your friendship Remember if someone is in a relationship respect that As soon as they are back on the market you have full dibs and can hang out together without causing any trouble   How awesome is it that youre now friends with the person you used to look at from a distance Now its time to step out of your comfort zone one more time and tell himher how you feel   You dont have to do this face to face Give them a secret admirerstyled letter with a hint at the end that will undoubtedly point to you You could even be forward and sign it If youre not going to do it face to face or during Skype Face Time or any other video chat dont text them your confession or tell them via social media This may come across either as a joke to them or make you seem impersonal It doesnt have to be a long eloquent letter either Use your own words and say what you think they should know If you choose to tell them in real life keep it casual You dont need to disclose your late night internet stalking or how you think of them every night before you sleep so you can dream about them You should however tell them that you think theyre cool and ask if they would want to try a romantic relationship Use your own words of course so that they know youre being genuine Each friendshiprelationship is different and there is no one way to tell someone you like them but if you want to stay friends either way casual is the way to go Although if you are the type of person who is extravagant or know that this person will appreciate a big and obvious gesture feel free not to be casual at all Get creative and do you No matter if youre simple or elaborate in your confession be true to who you are and be creative If this person is a good person they will appreciate the time and effort you put into letting them know whether they feel the same way or not   If you are serious about wanting this person to like you back or at least think of you romantically sooner or later you will need to let them know Of course make sure you feel ready and are at a place where you can speak comfortably with this person Just let your potential future bae know you are interested in getting to know them romantically This confession can be as simple or elaborate as you feel Dont overthink this or be afraid you did not come this far to give up now Be honest but dont feel as if you have to spill it all Remember that they are your friend and let some of that stress roll off your back   Dont put any pressure on them for an immediate response Leave it somewhat openended so that they also have time to get themselves together Your friend will be glad you didnt ambush them or make them feel like they had to say yes or no   If they say    Yes the feelings are mutual You overcame your shyness and told the object of your desire how you felt You should be proud of you for getting through that Now is your chance to prove to them that you are the perfect boygirlfriend for them which will be easy since you were friends first  No they would rather stay friends or dont feel the same way have no fear You can try again later or simply move on Someone else will come along believe it or not and you will find love again Hey at least you can cross that off your bucket list You should still be very proud of yourself for breaking out of your shell Make sure you dont let this stop you from trying again If they ask you out before you do or tell you they like you first dont hold back Let them know that you have liked them for a while too This doesnt mean everything will be perfect and easy from now on but the hardest part is over Enjoy your relationship and remember to stay friends with them even in your newfound love
If you care about the girl at all then you owe it to her to spend some time finding a way to give her the bad news as nicely as possible If you dont plan ahead at all then you may accidentally end up hurting her even more confusing her or just sounding like a jerk without meaning to You dont have to rehearse every word but you should have a sense of what youre going to say to end the relationship and what reason youre going to give for doing it Here are some things you can say   Im really sorry but I just dont think things are working out between us I feel like were becoming different people and cant find a way to make it work This is really hard for me to say but I think we should end our relationship I know we both have been unhappy for a while because were not really compatible and we both need to move on This relationship just isnt working out anymore Ive been spending so much time at work and youve been so busy with your other friends that we havent made our time together a priority I think its too late to turn back from that Avoid anything like Well Im kinda bored of you Or Ive found someone else  If the girl means anything at all to you then do her the courtesy of breaking up with her in person If you dump her over text or email then youll always be the jerk who couldnt build up the courage to dump his girlfriend like a man Though youll feel a momentary relief when you press that send button the repercussions of your actions wont be worth taking the easy way out Give the girl a chance to hear you out and to have a conversation about the breakup If you care about her then youll want her to have a real chance to get some closure   The only reason you shouldnt break up with the girl in person is if youre in a long distance relationship and wont be seeing each other for a while In this case its better to do it over the phone than to wait until the next time you see each other   Theres no perfect time to break up with someone No matter what the person will be upset stressed out and possibly angry However you can minimize the damage a bit by making sure youre picking a time when the girl has nothing going on afterwards and when you know she wont be incredibly stressed because of a huge testbig gameimportant interview the next day If you pick a time when shes less likely to be stressed then youll make it easier for her to get the message   If shes constantly stressed and has a lot going on at all times dont let this delay you from breaking up with her for too long  just try to find a day when shes less stressed than usual if you can   Your first priority is picking a quiet isolated place where youre not likely to run into anyone you know After that just try not to pick a place that means a lot to you like the bench where you shared your first kiss or your favorite restaurant Breaking up with her in a place that is meaningful for your relationship will only worsen the pain Just pick a place that is quiet neutral and as unromantic as possible If you take her for a long walk through a rose garden or on a beach then yeah the break up will take her by surprise   Dont act too serious or sad when you ask her if shes free later Just keep your cool and ask if shell be around later You can say Theres something I want to talk to you about but thatll make it pretty obvious that you have some bad news to deliver so if you can keep it a bit vague This doesnt mean you should catch her by surprise completely but that you shouldnt upset her too much before the conversation or shell want to have the talk on her terms then and there and you may not be prepared   You can say something nice or make small talk first but theres no use in prolonging the pain After a minute or two once you and the girl have settled in you should just tell her that you want to end the relationship The longer you sit there the more nervous youll get and the more likely you are to get off track If you and the girl make small talk for twenty minutes before you break up with her then youll be much more likely to confuse her Just take a deep breath and tell her that its over as nicely as possible Here are some things that you can say   Im sorry to say that I think our relationship has run its course Wed both be happier if we moved on This relationship is no longer working for me I know weve tried everything and it just wont get better It may not be a surprise that I havent been happy in this relationship for a while I really care about you but I just dont think we should date anymore   If you really dont care at all then theres no point in faking it But if the break up really is hurting you then make sure she sees it Look into her eyes talk slowly and let her see the pain on your face Most people dont think that the person doing the dumping also feels pain in a break up but both people actually suffer If she sees that youre not making an easy careless decision that means nothing to you then shell have a better chance of understanding where youre coming from   If you care about the girl give her the respect she deserves and let her tell you how she feels ask questions and share her feelings She may just want to cry and be upset and thats okay She may start namecalling and getting angry  in that case you may need to wrap things up If shes rambling on about the same thing over and over then you can cut her off but if she genuinely wants to share her feelings and is really hurt then do her the kindness of letting her talk to you   Shell likely have some questions for you and you can decide how much you want to explain   If youve fallen in love for someone else or realized that the girl youre with is just totally boring you can do her a favor and not tell her as much But if you do feel like she deserves an honest explanation of what really went wrong then you can answer her questions and explain the breakup in more detail Just remember that you only have to tell the girl what youre comfortable with and the more you say the more pain you may cause Find a balance between being honest and protecting the girl   Really shell just be asking a different version of why over and over once you feel like you can no longer give her new information it may be time to wrap things up   You came there to dump the girl so dont leave there deciding to be together but to work things out promising her that you just want to take a break for a month or saying that you should still date but have an open relationship The girl may break you down by how cute sad or just how gosh darn persistent she is but you cant let her change your original game plan If you decided to dump her then you must have had a good reason so stick to it   This is why you should keep the conversation as short as possible The longer youre out there the more likely you are to have a change of heart   Dont ruin your reputation by being a jerk to the girl or going on a date with her best friend Even if she did something to hurt you or youre just plain sick of her theres no need to be extra mean or just to hurt her feelings because you dont feel like dating anymore You want her to leave with a relatively good impression of you and for her not to tell all of the girls she knows that you should be avoided at all costs If you feel some nasty words coming up bite your tongue   The less time you spend on the conversation the better Once youve said your part and have her say what she wants to say then theres no need to sit around together feeling sad and letting those feelings of nostalgia bubble up This will only cause you more pain cause you to rethink what youve done and leave you feeling even more sad and confused You shouldnt dump the girl and then just walk away but if you feel like youve both said everything you need to say and that youre both just repeating yourselves then tell the girl you need to go   If you really think the girl will try to drag it on come up with a reasonable excuse for leaving in advance   Though the girl wont walk away thinking youre the greatest guy on the planet you should have her leave without thinking that youre a horrible person Say goodbye like a gentleman say something nice and try to smile If youre inside hold the door for her when you leave Dont walk away after flinging insults at her or that will stick with her You want her to leave the relationship with a somewhat positive impression dont you
Gaining the trust of the girl you like of the old friend youâve let down or of the husband youâve betrayed are not all that different Assuming that girls  young women have special requirements for gaining trust can easily devolve into stereotyping and unfair generalizations Instead universal advice like that provided by How to Build Trust makes a good starting point for anyone In it the basic requirements for earning trust include   Being reliable Being honest Being open Showing integrity More specific ideas about how to get a girl to trust you should draw from basic building blocks like these  Thereâs a good chance that the old saying âonce bitten twice shyâ may apply to your girl At some point sheâs probably had her trust betrayed by someone important to her and therefore may be hesitant to take the chance of being hurt againDonât take it personally if she is hesitant to trust you because of past disappointments Accept the challenge to work even harder to earn her trust For instance getting help from âreferencesâ â mutual friends or acquaintances who can speak to your trustworthiness â may help you break through the walls of skepticism created by previous betrayals Gather as much evidence as possible that you can be trusted but expect your own words and actions to be most important It is always easier to trust someone who is clear and unequivocal about his intentions be it in business in love or in lifeEvasiveness or deception about your real interest in a girl will make it easy for her to withhold her trust In relationship terms be upfront about whether you are just seeking some shortterm fun hope for something more lasting or simply arenât sure where you see things heading   If you have any genuine care or respect for that girl you met at a party for example donât lead her on by saying youâre interested in a longterm relationship if you are not Show trust in her by being honest from the start and youâll be more likely to earn her trust in return   Donât try to be someone you are not in order to draw the interest of a girl and then expect to be able to gain her trust Even if you manage to âfoolâ her temporarily she will eventually see through this fabrication and then it will be nearly impossible to earn her trust after you have deceived her right from the startBe confident in who you are and expect that to be good enough to score her affections and eventually her trust It is much easier to trust someone who looks talks and acts like someone who is comfortable in his or her âown skinâ If you know you are trustworthy she will eventually see it too   Reliability is always a critical factor in building trust whether from a coworker or a romantic interest She needs to believe youâll do what you say youâll do and not do what you say you wonât each and every time That is the kind of person who is easy to trustBe consistent in what you say and do If you say youâll pick her up at 7 oâclock do it If you promise to drop a bad habit that bothers her work as hard as you can to do so Her trust will be the reward for your efforts   Lots of girls out there and guys for that matter appreciate an unsolicited hug a hand to hold a gentle kiss or a shoulder to cry on Proving that you understand her wants and needs and that you are always âthere for herâ will put you on the fast track toward earning her trustOf course realizing that she isnât a hugger or showing that you know and accept her current limits on the physical nature of your relationship can also build trust Sometimes what you donât do is just as important as what you do in order to gain trust If she feels like you donât understand her or are pressuring her to move things forward she is more likely to withhold her trust   Trust is almost impossible to build without regular open and honest communication Prove yourself to be an active involved and interested listener and speak to her thoughtfully and truthfully about your feelings and you will slowly but surely gain her trust   In the business world people have found that certain simple direct phrases tend to help build trust with coworkers or clients The same concept holds true in personal relationships as well Phrases like âthank youâ âyesâ âI willâ âWhat do you thinkâ âI trust your judgmentâ and âI understandâ are unequivocal and demonstrate a focus on the other personâs needs It turns out that trust is a lot like everyoneâs favorite nursery rhyme egg Humpty Dumpty itâs easy to break and very hard to rebuild afterwardOnce youâve betrayed a girlâs trust âall the kingâs horses and all the kingâs menâ may not be enough to get it back Sometimes youâll just have to accept that it is lost forever But that doesnât mean you shouldnât try your hardest to earn it backNever assume that you deserve a second chance especially if you have seriously betrayed her trust such as by cheating on her Earning trust is hard and reearning it is that much more difficult Donât fool yourself about the substantial effort it will take on your part and the reality that it may not be enough not matter what you do   The first step to regaining trust is always to be completely honest to her and to yourself about what you did to lose it in the first place Think long and hard about why you did the thing that broke her trust and be prepared to patiently answer her questions and accept her anger and sadnessNever try to downplay what you have done to break her trust It is serious business and you need to always treat it as such if you want any shot at regaining her trust That said once youâve âcome cleanâ try not to obsess over why you did it or the âgory detailsâ At some point both of you have to be able to move forward if trust is to be rebuilt You canât control her pace in moving past it but you can control yours Never make excuses for your indiscretions that have caused a loss of trust You screwed up it was your fault and yours alone and now it is up to you to do everything you can to rebuild what your actions have broken As with coming clean with all the details a full apology is necessary to âclean the slateâ before you can begin working to restore trustSaying âSorry I messed up I promise I wonât do it againâ will not cut it Try something more like âI am very sorry that I lied to you about something so important I know how much it has hurt you and it is all my fault I hope you will give the the chance to earn your forgiveness and regain your trust even if I donât deserve it right nowâ   Sometimes people can become so focused on admitting their errors and begging for forgiveness that they never get around to forgiving themselves We all make stupid mistakes and hurt people we care about Without minimizing the seriousness of what youâve done you need to be able to accept it and leave it behind if you hope to move forward If you canât get past it sheâll definitely never be able toRegaining trust is hard work and requires you to make real changes in your life If youâre too busy still punishing yourself for screwing up you wonât be able to put the work in that is necessary to regain her trust Remember you canât take back what youâve done All you can do is try to make amends for it and prove that youâve learned from this mistake and wonât repeat it   Earning forgiveness and regaining trust take time and they have to happen at the pace set by the person who has been harmed Your actions and words will help determine if the process succeeds but you canât force things along Sometimes all you can do is wait and hopeExpect setbacks in the process Things may seem like they are going well and then all of a sudden she canât stand to look at you again The truth is that the sting of a betrayal is never going to completely vanish and like any old injury you have to accept that the pain is going to âflare upâ every so often and sometimes for no apparent reason   You broke her trust and you have to do much of the heavy lifting in order to stand a chance of getting it back However she has to be willing to put in the effort as well Only by working together can trust be restored If she canât or wonât join you in making the effort to rebuild things take that as a sign that the break is irreparableIf open and honest communication is important to building trust it is even more vital to rebuilding it Be willing to talk and listen a lot Donât hold back and encourage her to do the same Consider engaging the help of a therapist or counselor trained in dealing with broken relationships If she raises the idea never hesitate to agree If itâs your idea give her the time and space to consider it
If you have a shared interest in movies or music ask your crush to go with you It lets your crush know youâre interested and gives you a chance to have a fun memory together which can make it more likely that your crush will become interested in youDonât forget that some people are shy and even if theyâre interested in and noticing you making an effort they might not say anything Go ahead and ask them to do something For example you can say something like âSo we both really like action movies and the new Fast and the Furious is coming out Do you want to go see it togetherâ   This way you have a chance to hang out with your crush without a lot of pressure If youre nervous about asking outright make lunch seem like an opportunity to do something else like talking about a homework assignment or a work issueFor example if you work together you can say something like Hey James did you want to grab some lunch Theres a place down the street with really good soup and sandwiches and I thought we could talk about the project If you go to school together say something like Jenny do you want to sit with me at lunch I had a question about our homework assignment   If youâre really nervous about hanging out with your crush oneonone suggest you hang out with a group of friends This gives you a chance to spend time with your crush without so much pressureIf youâre going to try a group date let a few of your friends know what youâre doing and ask if theyâre willing to go Then you can make it seem to your crush like youâre inviting them to come with you and your friends rather than making a big deal out of spending time with them For example you can say something like âmy friends and I are going roller skating on Saturday Do you want to come with usâ   If you like someone they might not like you back or even notice you right away Be patient and keep trying to befriend them It might take a little while but it can pay off in the end
When you see your crush and start feeling excited and nervous focus on your breathing Remember that your lungs get less oxygen when you take quick short breaths which makes your heart speed up and your body tense up So make a point of taking deep long breaths to calm both your body and mindInhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth Encourage deeper breaths by imagining that your lungs are down in your abs Practice on your own so itâs easier to do when your crush is around  This may sound odd but itâs actually a yoga trick called the Gyan Mudra Form an âOâ by joining the tip of your index finger with the tip of your thumb just like you would to signal âokayâ to someone Refocus your attention from the inside to the outside Instead of focusing on the excitement building up inside you just concentrate on the feeling of your thumb and fingertip touchingYou can do this right before you see that special someone or even while youâre talking to them Just hold your hands behind your back when you see them or use whatever youâre holding like a textbook to hide it from view if you think it looks odd   If you know you will be seeing your crush any minute listen to something relaxing beforehand if you can Create a playlist full of calming music on your device Otherwise just play a song that usually calms you down in the back of your headWhatever music you choose the keyword is ârelaxingâ Your bodyâs rhythms will naturally fall in sync with the musicâs This means your body will start getting worked up if you play something too exciting   Get rid of your anxieties by dancing them out before you see that guy or girl who makes you swoon This is a proven way to relieve stress so if youâre all alone or if you donât mind busting a move in public go all out and dance it off Otherwise just move your feet around by taking a walk stepping on and off a curb or stair or something similarDepending on what type of music you like to dance to this might seem to contradict the whole bit about listening to relaxing music But donât worry about that Dancing will increase your blood flow throughout your body and deliver more oxygen everywhere which help tense muscles relax and feel better So if youâre going to be active the more active the better Then as the hour draws near when you expect to run into your crush switch over to your playlist of your relaxing music to get yourself squared and centered   Dont fret over those little imperfections that youd like to wish away Also dont worry about trying to morph into a certain type that you think your crush might like Dress the way you like to dress Style your hair the way you like it Be yourself and own it   Sure people are definitely attracted to certain looks But its been proven that people are likely to respond much quicker to your level of confidence than your appearance So if youre a brunette or redhead whos worried that your crush only seems to date blondes or vice versa stop worrying As long as you act confident in your own looks theyll be more blown away by your selfassurance than your hair color
Once you do this you can both begin to work through the hurt and the anger and find a way to move on with your life  People deal with break ups differently Some people get very angry and are inclined to burn all his things some will be very depressed for a long time and hang on to all the memories and some will pretend they dont care   The two of you obviously broke up for a reason so try not to dwell on what could have been or who was at fault the most Remember the good times but dont idealize him just because you miss him make sure you recall the bad times too   When people break up the shock and upset caused is often so great that it makes their judgement blurred If you got back together straight away it might be okay for a while but eventually the old problems will start to creep their way back in The way you feel now isnt the way you will feel six months or a year down the line Give it some time   Even if your goal is to be friends eventually you need some time to start off with Things will be too raw for you to be friends while one or both of you is still hurting You need time away from the relationship to evaluate what you want and to learn how to be yourself again If you are somebody who constantly needs to check his Facebook bombard him with texts or look through old pictures delete them Delete his number get rid of his things   Take every opportunity do things you couldnt do before and fill your time However make sure you give yourself time to grieve for the loss of your relationship   This isnt about showing him youre not upset or that you dont care because obviously you do but have dignity and pride Try not to get too low   There will be so many people telling you different things but just do what feels right in your heart If it takes you a month or two to stop sleeping in his jacket then so be it and dont feel bad for it   Holding grudges and being angry is very consuming and takes a lot of effort Youre better than that and once you face facts it does get easier Try not to think about it too much dont let it take over your life Learn how to be by yourself outside a relationship Dont do things just to spite the other person

It is important to know that your changed feelings towards your friend are for real and are not just some flight of fancy brought about by a soppy movie or seeing other friends together as couples This must be a genuine hitinthegut experience when you surpass the standard friendship reality and envision the two of you together for years to come Ask yourself   Is this real Or am I just wanting something that I know isnt going to work out Do I have the fortitude to cope with being rejected if I suggest a more intimate relationship and he rejects me Do I think things can be patched up should this happen Has he shown me any signs of interest Is he currently in a relationship  Its no good barging in on an existing relationship he has with someone else proclaiming that hes making a mistake by not choosing you instead Not only will this seem very outoftheblue to him but its possible that your friendship wont recover if he sees this as an act to destabilize and existing relationship   Nurture your friendship If you still feel this way down the track and he breaks off with this person youll be there for him If he doesnt break it off then friendship it was meant to be Hollywood movies aside it is just not that helpful to go around busting up your friends love life   If he still has a fire for his ex you dont want him as a beau So how do you find out Ask him Do it casually as part of your usual conversations Get him to talk about his feelings for his ex whether theyre good or bad Get him to reveal whether hes seen his ex lately if they still keep in touch and so forth If hes not over his ex yet back off If he is then consider him available with caution of course   Let your guy friend know in no uncertain terms that you are 100 percent over that person who broke your heart Still being hung up on an ex is a major deterrent for any person seeking a close relationship nobody wants the drama and disappointment that comes with that Hence if you want this guy friend to know that youre available make your relationship health status very clear   Let your guy friend know how much you highly think of him and how much you think he would make a great boyfriend for someone one day It is a subtle yet obvious enough clue to hear that you think he would actually make a fabulous boyfriend   But dont call it a date In its place invite him out to the movies one night as friends If he asks you out the following weekend and you ask him about again the next thing you know you both will find yourself dating   Send him comical text messages and emails Its a fantastic way to build your friendship and future relationship Guys want to feel that they can be themselves with you By letting all hang out youre letting him know that youre fun and cool at the same time
Its important to get to know each other before deciding that this guy is worth shattering your nerves for and telling him you like him  If youre in class sit close to him or even next to him Try to get into his activity groups or other exercises In sport get on his team where possible or play in pairs or alongside of him If youre not in the same class catch him at his locker and say hello or spend time with him and his friends during lunch and recess   Of course only do this if the activity also interests you otherwise its a waste of your time This can provide a great way for him to get to know you better and vice versa   Can you ask a bunch of friends back to your place that will also include him Can you go somewhere hes likely to be spending time such as at the mall a sports field or hanging downtown Find out what is possible and wont put you in any difficult positions with your parents   This will help you to make the decision about telling him that you like him and to ask him on a date   Ask them what they think about your prospects with this guy and how they interpret his reactions toward you at the moment Often people outside of a crush will have more objectivity and may be able to see the signsââor lack of themââthat you cant quite put your finger on Always talk to trusted friends who will keep your confidence   Try to find out carefully whether your crush already has a love interest or might have any interest in you Do your best to avoid making your interest too obvious unless you want them to relay it straight back to him If in doubt skip his friends and only talk to yours   You are going to put yourself out on a limb without knowing how hell respond yet so he had better be worth it   This gives both of you wriggle room to back out and to say what you really feel without others overhearing and possibly spreading rumors This might be at the end of lunch after school or when youre alone at the lockers Scout out possible good times and places a few days before you decide to tell him   Avoid the temptation to text IM or email him with this news It is definitely something that should be passed on personally facetoface   While you need to be ready to go with the flow and react to his reactions when you actually tell him it cant hurt to rehearse your opening lines with him For example   Hey Josh have you got a moment Theres something I wanted to talk to you about Josh says yes so you proceed I wanted to tell you that Im really enjoying spending time with you and that I like you a lot I was hoping you might want to hang out with me this weekend Hey Hank weve been great friends for a while now and I have grown to really like you Would you be interested in coming to the movies with me this Friday So Zack I just wanted to let you know something that matters to me a lot Its that I really like you I was hoping you might feel the same way too   This is probably not news to him but it is out in the open now instead of hanging in the air between you two If there is a long silence you could interject that you just wanted to get that out there and that he doesnt have to say anything straight away that youre happy for him to think about it for a time   This is not necessarily the end of things but it may happen and isnt a reflection on you as a person He can have many reasons for not wanting to reciprocate the feelings such as already having a love interest not wanting a relationship at this point in time or being more interested in friendship than anything more intimate Be gracious and say that its okay youre happy to stay good friends and not speak about it again for now   Youre now both open with one another and can go ahead and arrange a date
Instead try to get to know them or even be friends They wont like or date you if they dont know you  Dont make a fool of yourself Try to speak to them but make sure you dont do anything bizarre   Tell them your problem and pay attention to any advice they give you Since your friend is not the one in love they are probably more clearheaded than you are just now   Try to pay attention to your appearance and look nice but dont overdo it Just be yourself   You dont want them to think youre a slob Make sure you smell good  no expensive cologne needed just dont reek Whatever you do dont wear a ton of anything scented especially stuff like AXE Everyone can get sick of this Believe me The commercials about people attacking you are wrong   Know your topic what you want to say about it and what you want to ask them about it Yes you have to ask them questions otherwise you are simply talking at them and you look dumb   But dont go overboard You have to make sure that you dont sound like you are going to force them to cry on your shoulder   Although you should have some confidence in yourself people really like it when guys are shy and awkward and cute Too much confidence makes you look like arrogant or maybe even rude But dont overdo the awkwardness it will come naturally Overall just behave naturally like you would around your friends   Although you might not believe youre on a date with the person dont stress out about it because stressing can lead to a date disaster Try to think about things they like if the conversation steers the wrong way
If youre talking to the girl then you should stay focused on her face If just looking into her eyes isnt enough for you start to really study them Note the color of her eyes whether or not they are speckled how they are shaped what kind of eye makeup if any she is wearing how long her lashes are etc Only do this if you dont think its creeping her out and if youre engaged in conversation   Even if youre focusing on her eyes you should break eye contact from time to time so the girl doesnt feel creeped out or like youre paying too much attention to her face  Pretend you have to give her description to a sketch artist and fixate on her facial features Note the color of her eyebrows the shape of her nose the width of her cheekbones whether or not she has freckles or moles etc If youâre an artist try to memorize her face well enough to be able to sketch it later Again try not to stare Keep your eye gaze natural and let it flit around the scenery around you two as well   This is best achieved by looking at her whole face at once and mentally noting her various features not by eyeballing every area of her face individually Be especially careful not to stare at her lips as this can also be taken the wrong way   If you donât know her that well or feel like youâve been staring too long alternate between looking at her face and looking off to the side like youâre thinking or remembering something Looking up and to one side is especially effective as it keeps your eyes from straying downwards Though this may feel weird to you at first itâs very common for people to get lost in thought like this when they speak   So making eye contact is great but you cant do it 247 without freaking the girl out so decide on a place where you will rest your eyes from time to time It can be the clock above the girls head it can be your watch or the books youre holding or it can be the door to the left of you Whenever your eyes need to take a break return them to that same location so they dont end up wandering over to an inappropriate area One of the reasons that you may be looking at the girls chest is because you feel the need to break eye contact and naturally rest your eyes on an appealing place   Sure the girl may think its a little strange that youre looking at the clock every minute but thats better than staring at her chest isnt it   Talk to her about anything  movies school events or whatever interests you enough to distract you from her breasts Practice the art of good conversation and attentive listening If youre having a great conversation then soon enough you wont be thinking about her boobs Think of ways to make her laugh impress her or to make her feel special and soon enough youll be focusing on the right things   If you do end up staring at the girls boobs she will definitely notice She may call you out on it and embarrass you or she may just feel bad and like you think of her as a sex object Either way looking at the girls boobs wont make your relationship any better and can only lead to bad things Here are some other consequences that may happen as a result of you staring at the girls breasts   You may get an embarrassing erection from looking at her breasts for too long You will likely lose any chance of asking her out or seducing her She may tell other girls what happened and they wont want to hang out with you because they will think youre a pervert   If nothing else is working for you picture your momâs face in place of hers That should keep your eyeballs squared firmly above her shoulders Though this may sounds a little bit gross thats exactly the point  do whatever you can to keep your eyes at eye level Nobody said it was going to be fun And hey why not you can also pretend shes your sister Either way will keep you nice and respectful   If the girl catches you staring at her chest and calls you out on it then dont deny it turn bright red and call her a liar Just fess up Say Im so sorry I know that was disrespectful Sure that wont be pleasant for you but its better than looking like a wimp Remember that seeing you looking at her chest probably wasnt all that pleasant for the girl either

A girl who is interested in you will laugh more often and her voice may rise in pitchShe might even say flirtatious things like complimenting you on how you look today If she is more willing to talk about personal topics with you such as your plans for the future she might be interested romanticallyIf youâre lucky sheâll even give you helpful hints for dates like mentioning that she loves a particular band or wants to go dancing Giving you a compliment such as âOh I love your shirt That band is one of my favoritesâ can indicate interest If she asks you about what you are doing later on in the week she might be subtly asking you to spend some time with her   If the person is constantly interrupting you or doesnât seem focused on the conversation then they are probably not romantically interested in you Try to pay attention during your time together for signs that she may not be interested in you   Interruptions are rarely a result of a girl being shy which makes it a good indicator Gauge the responses you get during a conversation For example if you were just explaining how well your garden is growing and she responds with âUhhuhâ she is likely not interested Silence can be a good indicator that there isnt a good connection   Some studies propose that humor is one of the best indicators of romantic interestIf you are having humorous exchanging and laughing at one anotherâs silly jokes there may be a romantic spark in your relationship Humor is a way to test the social watersand figure out if you are a good fit with the person   For example you might both playfully imagine a silly situation and discuss what you think would happen Joking around can let you know if your sense of humor is similar with hers You might enjoy puns and she might hate them While this may not prevent you from liking each other its good to know how best to make one another laugh   Playful behavior can be a sign of personal interest and is also a trait that is commonly valued in potential partners You can also show your own interest and make yourself more appealing by being lighthearted and playful when spending time together Keep an eye out for playful behavior and try to be playful yourself to learn if a girl likes youPlayful people are more likely to be perceived as attractive by those who are not Both men and women find playfulness equally important and attractive   When a girl likes you she may display signs of jealousy when you are interacting with or talking about another girl This can be a good sign that the girl you are with has an interest in you Pay attention for any signs of jealousy to gauge her level of interest in youShe might respond coldly or dismissively if you compliment another girl This may indicate jealousy Avoid trying to make her overly jealous Once you notice jealousy stop trying to bring it out in her
A well fitting girth on a new saddle will be slightly longer than when the saddle is broken in as the billets stretch You need to use a girth that fastens with the girth buckles just below the appropriate position during the break in period one or two holes below the middle billet hole on both near and far side  New leathers are rough on saddle flaps that are not yet broken in to accommodate them   Wait for a day of steady rain Not a downpour and light mist wont do the trick Its best to buy your saddle in the summer when the temperatures are such that you will be able to completely break in the saddle with one ride   Do not wear a raincoat that covers any portion of the saddle   During this ride pay very close attention to your equitation in particular your leg position and seat It is helpful to have a friend who watches you and corrects ANY deviation Start with your stirrups adjusted into the position you most commonly ride in Shorten or lengthen your stirrups into the other lengths you use once your saddle is thoroughly saturated Ride equal time in all positions after the saddle is softened by the rain   The billets stretch most during the first ride   Seal the exposed leather with a coat of glycerin Dip a bar of glycerin into water and use a dry cloth to pick up a patch of it There should be NO bubbles Coat the top of the saddle fairly thickly and turn over BE SURE THAT YOU ARE USING PURE GLYCERIN Many soaps contain basic high pH additives that will damage the leather leather is naturally slightly acidic due to the tanning process   Use warm neatsfoot oil on the lower flaps those in contact with the horse taking care not to oil the side in contact with the horse Do not oil any stitching Oil in extremely thin coats using a soft cloth or sponge Repeat until the oil does not soak into the leather then wipe off any excess and allow to set for at least 24 hours Oil will soak into the leather over time and may accept more oil after setting DO NOT OVER OIL THE LEATHER If it is overoiled it will become too soft and delicate which will decrease the life of the leather It is not recommended to oil soft leather at any point including in some cases the knee rolls blocks and often the seat of the saddle It is possible if desired to lightly oil the smooth side of hard leather on the skirt and upper flaps Oiling the smooth side takes far longer but it makes it easier to control the evenness and amount of oil used   Alternatively it is possible to lightly oil the billets following the same instructions as those for the saddle flaps and skirt   The leather should be darker softer and shinier than when new   Continue to closely monitor your leg placement during the first few weeks of service Check your girth very frequently and use a shorter one when billets stretch and the buckles get too high on them
As you move forward in the letter be upfront about your feelings A love letter is not the place to be shy Tell the girl why you admire her and what qualities about her most intrigue you Go into specifics when possible You may not know a lot about this person but mention small things about her that you love For example maybe you think the buttons she has on her purse are hilarious Maybe you notice she listens to a particular band on her headphones that you also enjoy   Be upfront about why youve never approached her in person While many people enjoy anonymous love letters there is always the risk of coming off the wrong way You dont want the recipient to feel like shes being watched It can help if you assure her at some point youre a relatively normal person who happens to feel more comfortable expressing feelings in writingThere are a variety of reasons you may prefer writing a love letter You could be shy for example and find expressing yourself easier in words Maybe you only see her when shes at work and dont want to bother her Whatever you reason make sure you state it early on You want to make sure the recipient understands why you chose a letter over simply talking to her This way you can help avoid potential confusion or discomfortReturning to the example of the girl you know in algebra class you may hesitate to approach her because youre shy You could write something like I always want to talk to you in person However Im very shy by nature Now that were halfway through the semester Im worried Ill never get the courage together So I decided to write you a letter   Oftentimes people end up inadvertently talking about themselves in a love letter While you should certainly talk about your own feelings make sure to focus primarily on the recipient As you write the letter express what you like about this person If you admire that shes always listening to Elliot Smith on her headphones say so However do not go on a 3 paragraph anecdote about your own admiration for SmithUse specifics when possible If youre writing to a relative stranger specifics may be hard However small things go a long way Do you love the coconutlike smell of her shampoo Do you enjoy how she laughs to herself during downtime at the coffee shop Do you remember a comment she made in class that was particularly insightful Lets return to the algebra class example You could write something like I notice youre always listening to Elliot Smith I am a big fan of his as well Im impressed by how drawn in you seem to the music You seem to have an intense appreciation for art   You dont have to write in a lofty elevated style if it doesnt come naturally to you The primary purpose of a love letter is to express your feelings in a way that makes the recipient feel good about herself The best way to do this is to simply be yourself and use your own words This will sound more authentic and sincere when expressed in a way that feels natural to you Do not get hung up on inserting elaborate metaphors or dramatic declarations of your admiration into your writing Instead focus on simply being yourself and speaking in your own voice As you near the end of your letter tell the person how their presence has affected you The girl youre writing to may be flattered to know she made an impact on your life Talk about how she makes your days better and why you appreciate herThis may be something small as you dont know this girl yet However even a small impact can be flattering For example maybe you always look forward to your 8AM British Literature seminar simply because you enjoy the contributions this girl makes to class Returning to are example you could write something like I know it sounds silly but getting to see you each day makes me a bit more enthusiastic about going to algebra Ive never been a math person but seeing you is a small treat that makes class more bearable
If you find yourself taking it personally or doubting yourself try to build your confidence instead Make a list of your favorite things about yourself and spend time nurturing these traits That way if someone else doesnât appreciate you it wonât seem so important because you know and appreciate yourself   For example maybe you like that you are a loyal friend or maybe you like that you are kind to people Write down the great qualities that you have and focus on these Donât take it personally Your crushs rejection likely has nothing to do with you Your crush not having feelings for you is not a statement about you itâs a statement about them You are a perfectly lovely person who simply wasnât meant to be with your crush There are so many reasons that your crush might not be interested and almost none of them have to do with you Maybe your crush wasnât ready for a relationship Maybe they donât have time right now Maybe they donât want to make a commitment to someone Maybe they have feelings for someone else Donât question yourself Itâs their loss  Make a list of everything else in your life such as the people activities and interests that you have This will help you to see yourself more clearly and not let one personâs rejection be blown out of proportion   Donât let your crushs rejection define you There are so many other important aspects of your life All of these things that make you happy help define who you are You are the same wonderful person whether someone notices it or not Your worth is never dependent on any other person Seeing all of these other great parts of your life will help you to put one persons rejection in perspective There are over seven billion people on our planet So one of them didnât like you Thatâs ok That one person might have felt like the whole world to you but they are simply one of many There are probably millions of people who have similar characteristics as your crush Now that you know what kind of person you are looking for you can open your eyes to all the other wonderful people out thereOver your lifetime there will likely be many people who you like and many who like you Sometimes you will like someone and they wonât like you back Sometimes someone will like you and you wonât like them back Sometimes you both wonât like each other And every once in a while you will find someone who likes you as much as you like them This is to be expected This is what happens when there are so many different people in the world Think of it as an adventure and journey to finding the right person rather than a form of rejection
This is the first thing you have to do if you want to move on If you feel like crying let out those tears If youre angry scream and kick some furniture If youre hurt confused and upset cry yell pout complain shout and do whatever you have to do to get those negative emotions out of your body  Of course its better to do this when you have some privacy but dont try to keep everything in for the sake of being composed Youre hurt Theres nothing wrong with admitting that        If you dont show any emotions then youll just be in denial about how awful you feel This will make you feel those same angry bitter feelings  for longer Dont be afraid to show weakness Crying in front of a close friend is perfectly normal Its okay to admit that Its not okay Everyone knows breakups suck and theres no point in acting like you dont care when you do Sure if you pass your ex by you can look as cool as a cucumber But when youre alone or with close friends Be who you are and show how you feel  You have a lot on your mind and its likely that you need some time to yourself  Though you may want to be around people every second of every day because youre terrified of being alone your best bet is to plan a date with yourself so you have some time to just be sad stare out a window write in your journal or just think about what happened If you refuse to be alone for a second after your heart ache begins then youll never be able to truly deal with it       Think about it when is the last time you planned a date  with yourself This can be a miracle in disguise Pamper yourself Take a long hot bath put on some lotion do your hair and take care of your body Dont stop with the hygiene just because youre upset   Its okay to mope be sad and just hate life for a little while  Though you cant be sad forever being sad for a little while is perfectly natural and much better than forcing yourself to hang out with friends put a big smile on your face and laugh about your breakup or make it seem like it wasnt a big deal even if it was Tell your friends that youre going to stop being social for a little while and that you need a break from social events especially any that will involve alcohol Sure any good friend will try to force you to come out but try to make them understand that youre just not ready yet       Of course dont let this go on for too long If its been months since youve really socialized then you have a problem When you do go out there you can keep a low profile Dont talk too much laugh or just act hyper to prove that youre doing just fine   Though hanging out in big loud crowds may not be your best bet when youre dealing with a breakup confiding in a really good friend or two who really gets you can help you feel a lot better  You can do this over the phone or in person during a The New Girl marathon whatever feels right to you Having a person to talk to oneonone can help you get your feelings out while making you feel less alone       Sharing your feelings with everyone can make you feel worse but sharing them with one or two people who really care can help you heal faster Your friend may offer some comfort as well as some advice for how to move on Itll feel better to get your feelings out there Just dont fall into a pattern where you keep being sad and complaining to the same friend or youll start to recycle all of those negative feelings   Bitterness and regret are two of the most common emotions that people going through breakups can feel You may be bitter because of what your ex did because of how much he or she hurt you or because of all the time you wasted on such a bad relationship  You may regret the way you acted or regret that you put up with the other person for so long Well if you really want to deal with the breakup then you have to kick these negative feelings to the curb and focus on looking ahead instead of behind you       Sure you may feel like you wasted your time in the relationship and that can definitely make you bitter But no time spent on a relationship is really time wasted  the time you spent in the relationship will give you the perspective and experience you need to approach a new relationship in a more mature and productive way That may not be a big consolation now but youll appreciate this in the future You may regret certain things you did or said but theres no taking them back now You can only move forward not backward and dwelling on the past will only slow you down Romanticize the whole affair This may sound silly but pretending youre a character in a movie whos struggling and making everything dramatic can help you feel better  First it may make the whole break up seem less intense as blowing it out of proportion makes it more fictional and less like youre involved this doesnt mean to say however at some point you shouldnt confront it for what it is Secondly glamorizing yourself might make you laugh and after all laughter is the best medicine     This one takes time If you really want to deal with a breakup then you have to see that youre much better off without your ex even if you may feel the exact opposite  Theres no way that relationship was giving you as much joy and fulfillment as you thought  otherwise why did it end You may think that the thing you need the most is your special someone but that is absolutely the last thing that will make you feel better       Make a list of all of the reasons why you are better off alone Whenever you start doubting the benefits of your singledom read the list to yourself  read it out loud if you have to Even though it can hurt it can also help to make a mental note of all of the worst moments in your relationship Dont rehash them all but remind yourself of them whenever you start to feel sad and lonely Remind yourself why the relationship ended Its most likely a good reason and nothing that you can really fix Sure you had some great moments but did they really outweigh all of the pain you felt   Though its not impossible to become friends with your ex eventually it is nearly impossible to be friends with your ex right after a breakup  Though you may think its cool to text your ex when something reminds you of him grab coffee hang out with him at parties or just call him to say Hi the longer you do this the longer you will prolong the pain Sure youre used to talking to your ex all that time but that was while you were dating Now youll need to wait until you heal to talk to him  and that could take months or for breakups of longer relationships even years       Even if youre the one who did the breaking up dont talk to your ex If he or she really wants to talk explain that youre both better off taking a little breather Take your exs number out of your phone That will prevent you from texting or calling in a moment of weakness If you and your ex have the same friends you may have to take turns hanging out with them or you may have to lay low for a little while It wont be fun but its better than opening old wounds   You wont be able to deal with your breakup if every little thing in your room reminds you of your ex First off that means giving back any of his stuff And those gifts he gave you  You dont have to throw them out but its best to put them in boxes for a little while and that means you  Fluffy the bear he won for you at the carnival The necklace he gave you for your birthdayÂ  take it off and put it away in your jewelry box         You may feel that youve spent so much time with your ex that your lives are intertwined Getting rid of the things that remind you of your ex can help you unravel your connection Hide the things that remind you of him even if they werent gifts That poster from the concert you went to on your first date Its time to hang up some new wall art This will be highly painful for sure If you dont feel strong enough to do it on your own invite a friend over for a spring cleaning session   Clicking on your exs profile again and again to see if hes been hanging out with any new girls  or just to see how much fun hes having without you  will lead you to no good my dear  Take a week off from Facebook or even two See how little you miss it Dont try to make your ex jealous by posting lots of pictures of yourself having a supposedly great time Instead get offline and focus on actually having an amazing time Who cares if your ex knows about it or not       If you really are a Facebook addict limit yourself to just 15 minutes a day And force yourself to log out any time you click on your exs profile If you want to be dramatic about it you can always unfriend your ex on Twitter Facebook and other social media sites   If you and your ex loved going to the Italian place down the street on date night pick a new hot spot for your pasta cravings  If you two loved watching Jeopardy together bid Alex Trebek adieu for a little while If you always went mini golfing hiking biking or swimming together put a hiatus on these activities and find a new form of exercise that you love You dont have to stop doing these things forever  just until you can do them because you love them without thinking of your ex       You may feel like you did absolutely everything with your ex and that theres nothing that you can do to not think about him Thats when you can start finding a new routine that can give you a fresh start   Though its unlikely that you can move to a completely new apartment or home unless you lived together of course immediately after your breakup you can do some redecorating to make your space feel like its completely yours  Move your furniture around hang up new wall art and put up some new decorations This will help you clear your head and look at the world with fresh eyes  not eyes that only land on your ex       If you can take a mini vacation Just falling out of the same old routine for a weekend can help you get your head straight   At first you have to slow down and focus on healing assessing your thoughts and getting your head straight But once you feel a bit more emotionally stable and have cut ties with your ex you can work on having a busy and fulfilling schedule  Fill your days with friends laughter exercise fun activities and heck even some work Though you should always make some time for yourself the busier you are the less likely you are to think of your ex  or even to try to hang out with him       Fill your calendar once youre feeling up to it Dont force it too early Pick up a yoga or dance class that you can do two or three times a week This will help add some structure to your days Spend time with friends on the weekends as much as you can If you dont youll feel sad when youre at home on what used to be your date nights   Youll never appreciate your friends and family more than you will when youre going through a romantic rough patch  Make girls night a regular thing hang out with your siblings and parents more often than normal and even get closer to some friends youve fallen out of touch with because of your relationship Remind yourself how lucky you are to have so may people who care about you  even if your ex isnt one of them       Get silly with your friends Play a fun sport a game or do charades Just do something to take your mind off of your situation Go to the movies with your friends Try to see every Oscarnominated movie out that year to keep busy Take a road trip with your close friends The new surroundings will make you feel better Even making time for a phone date once or twice a week with your close friends will make you feel better   Keeping a record of your thoughts every day or two can help you feel in control of your emotions and can also help you reflect on how you are passing the time You will be able to open up evaluate your situation and get some breathing room from not hanging out with your friends  You dont have to dwell on all of your feelings about your breakup just recording your daily thoughts will make you feel more at peace       Make a date with yourself to do this at least twice a week Youll be surprised by how much calmer it can make you feel You can also use the journal to set goals for how you want to feel or act in the upcoming days   If you want to enjoy your life again then you have to keep mixing things up and introducing new rewards into your life What better reward than a new fulfilling activity you can do on your own  Try poetry dancing running biking sketching writing a screenplay playing the guitar blogging or doing something completely unfamiliar that youve always wanted to try Take the extra free time you have from not always being around your ex as an opportunity to try all of the things youve always wanted to try or to discover something new       Its okay to pick something you know you wont be good at Failing can be fun and can help you deal with hardships Picking new hobbies can also help you meet new people who are interested in the same thing If you already have a hobby that you love try to devote even more time to it   Maybe your ex hated Mexican food Maybe he hated traveling Maybe he hated big noisy parties while you couldnt get enough of them He could have hated hanging out with your sister and her artsy boyfriend Its time to take advantage of the fact that you can do whatever you want and that you dont have to please anybody when you make your schedule   Make a list of all of the things you could never do without your ex Then check them off your list one by one See how good it feels   If you want to find peace then you have to be truly happy on your own Though being single can be hard you have to appreciate the perks of the single life before you put yourself out there again  If youre too eager to jump in to a new relationship just because you dont want to be alone then youre almost guaranteed to run into Mr or Mrs Wrong yet again You can only truly start looking once youre content to be on your own for a little while       Indulge in the perks of being single having fun girls or guys nights being able to flirt all the time being able to set your schedule and not give in to anyone elses demands   If youre dealing with a breakup then you may be eating every bar of chocolate or every bacon burger within a ten mile radius of your home and referring to the effort your index finger makes when pushing the on and off buttons on your remote as your daily exercise  Though the last thing you may want to do is haul your butt over to the gym itll make you feel better physically and emotionally Exercising releases endorphins which are known to make people feel better and youll be needing that wont you       Exercising regularly also adds some stability to your routine and you may be lacking it   As you begin to truly accept the breakup you can view your own life from a more rational perspective  You can see that you have so many things to be thankful for your friends your family your health your looks all of the opportunities you have in your life It may be hard to think positively and notice all the good in your life when youre reeling from a break up but as you begin to come to terms with it you can remind yourself how fortunate you truly are even if youre still looking for love       Write a gratitude list Write down at least thirty things that you love about your life You shouldnt have to struggle to come up with those Make a habit of thanking people for helping you more often than usual Youll feel better about your life and they will too   Once youve spent enough time by yourself and have gotten enough distance from your ex you can slowly start putting yourself on the dating market again  Start slow and go on a date with a guy or girl your friend thinks is perfect for you or go on a lowpressure group date You probably wont find Romeo or Juliet on your first try  or your second or your seventh Once you get into the habit of looking and feeling good about who you are youll eventually find the right person       It could take months or even years to feel ready to truly open up and be ready for love Dont be frustrated if you just dont think its the right time Once youve found that right person youll see that all the suffering you went through from this breakup has made you a stronger more capable and more loving person
Once you find someone that you are interested in spend time with them Go out on dates meet up for lunch or even just go for a walk and talk Seeing each other frequently will give you the chance to connect with the other personYou should not see each other constantly A few times a week is usually healthy but smothering each other every day can actually be damaging to a new relationship Moreover coping with space may show you are not needy which can also be attractive   While you are spending time with the other person it is important to ask genuine questions and pay attention to their answers The more you learn about the person the deeper your relationship can grow They will also appreciate your honest desire to understand and care for themFor example you might ask them about what things they liked to do as kids or whether or not they have any family nearby Delay sexual intimacy until you feel comfortable communicating with them That way you are less likely to have a misunderstanding when you finally do hook up   Creating trust takes time You have to be consistent and show up when the other person needs you You have to keep promises that you make to them whether itâs showing up for a date or helping them clean their house It is also important to always tell them the truth and if they ask something that you are uncomfortable sharing tell them thatFor example if they asked you something deeply personal on a second date you could say âIâm not really comfortable talking about that right now but we can discuss it when we know each other betterâ Trust often happens when you make yourself vulnerable Opening yourself up to someone and showing them both your positive traits and your fears and insecurities help create deeper lasting connections
When youre talking to the girl you like you want to make her feel special People like it when others take an interest in them and the girl you like is no different Showing that you care about her thoughts will make her more interested in you as a result   Ask her opinion on things even if its something silly For example say youre wearing a shirt that your friend doesnt like ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not Tell her shes the final judge Itll make her laugh and feel important Pay attention to the things that she does and says so you can ask questions about it For example if she mentions going rock climbing ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it People like talking about themselves so before you jump in with stories of your own ask her another question about what she thinks   In this day and age people have really lost the skill of listening Really listening to one another Real listening is when you take the time to absorb what someone is saying rather than thinking about the next thing youre going to say or what youre going to have for dinner   For example even if youre at a loud party when youre having a conversation with her maintain eye contact ask questions and if your mind strays ask for clarification you can use the loud party as an excuse Sorry its really loud in here Can you repeat what you just said To this end when youre having a conversation with her dont fidget with stuff or keep looking all around the room or keep checking your phone Shell feel that you dont really care what she has to say   Laughter is a great way to bond with someone This doesnt mean that you need to be the class clown Actually it will probably work best if you arent All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things Now everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best but if youre not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail   Gently poke fun at yourself You dont have to do a big selfdeprecating speech in fact that will make you seem not confident but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you dont take yourself too seriously For example talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you werent paying attention or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was Bring up something funny that you saw that day or within the previous week It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny For example ask her if shes ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of   Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution Since everyone is different there is no onesizefitsall approach to flirting with someone Humor and eye contact are the two big ones but you can subtly flirt in other ways   Unless shes made it explicitly clear flirting really obviously can be offputting to some girls Keep that in mind when youre hanging out with her If you arent a good flirt eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets Flirting over text however can be a great nonthreatening type of flirting Of course you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person Keep texts short sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words especially a funny picture do NOT send explicit pictures unless she has actually asked for them Its good to have a reason to text You could say something like saw this and thought of you and then send a pictureGiving her the right compliment can be a great way of expressing interest and flirting Dont do something basic like youre the most beautiful girl Ive ever met it comes across as insincere Instead say something like Did you realize your sweater matches your eyes its a beautiful color or of course you aced that test youre super smart   In the end the best way to act around the girl you like is to tell her how you feel She might otherwise never know It can seem super intimidating or scary to bare your feelings like that and it is a very brave act But otherwise you both will be in this uncomfortable holding pattern   Dont do it in front of everyone Choose a time and place where youre both sober and in your right mind Simply say Hey I really like you and I was wondering if youd like to go on a date sometime Dont do this over the phone or text or social media because you will come across as a coward and most girls dont find that a particularly attractive quality Respect her decision even if she says no It can hurt when someone says no but remember that it isnt about you as a person its simply that your proposal didnt work for her because she isnt interested or because she already has a boyfriend or shes into girls etc You can ask why if you must but if she simply says Because Im not interested thats your answer and leave it at that If she says yes then yay Now you two can get to planning a super fun first date The relationship might not work out but you proved your bravery by asking her out and your worth by treating her with respect
Yes this may be an awkward conversation You may want to be honest and tell your friend about your crush however particularly if you continue to have strong feelingsYour friend may be able to provide some perspective and advice   You could say âThis is kind of embarrassing but I really like Emily Iâve liked her for a few months now I thought Iâd tell you because Iâm not sure what I should do and Iâd like to hear what you thinkâ Keep in mind that your friend might have a strong reaction like âEw no sheâs my sisterâ or âIâm totally freaked out by thisâ You could respond âI know how weird it probably is for you I thought a lot about whether or not I should tell you But I decided to be honest with you about it because my feelings havenât changedâ   Your friend might be angry disgusted or maybe even think itâs a great idea Ask your friend what they think you should do They may be able to see something about the situation that you are blind to   You could say âI was wondering if you think I should ask her out But I donât want to let this get between us and ruin our friendship I donât want to do it if it will be too weird for youâ Give your friend some time to think about their response if they need to   If your friend doesnât want you to date their sister accept their answer and do your best to move on If you go against your friendâs wishes to pursue their sister you will likely damage your friendship   Keep in mind that later in life you will likely have a greater regret about losing a friendship than not pursuing a crush
Youâve seen him at the coffee shop or gym a few times Youâve exchanged a smile here and there but thatâs about it Now he asks for your number If you arenât interested youâll need to let him know   You can say âIâd like to get to know you more as a person so why donât we become friendsâ Youâll see his true colors if he gets defensive and nasty If heâs willing to build a friendship first you may want to see what the future holds Thereâs nothing wrong with telling a person you donât have much interaction with why youâre not interested You likely have a valid reason If they canât accept it at least you may not have to see them much again   For example you could say that youâre just getting out of a relationship and arenât interested in finding a new one if that is the case You could also tell him youâre just not into him that way Additionally a âno thank youâ also works Treat him the way that you would want to be treated if you were in his shoes Avoid saying something like âew no wayâ or ânot a chanceâ Instead decline gracefully Remember it took a lot of guts for him to put himself out there Respect that when youâre turning him down   You could say âWow Iâm flattered but I canâtâ Letting him know that you appreciate him telling you how he feels could soften the blow
If he is talking highly of you around his friends or family or brings your name up whenever he gets a chance he may have a crush on you It shows you are always on his mind and he cant help but to talk about you If you have the opportunity try asking his friends questions about what he says when you are not around Here is a way you could ask   Do you know if he is dating anyone I never hear him say anything and I am just curious   Your friends are great resources to turn to because they may have noticed or heard things you have not Ask them if they have seen him give you any lustful glares or if he talks about you when you are not around Your friends should give you the honest truth   Do you know if he likes anyone Have you heard anything about who he is into Have you noticed him acting different around me Do you think he treats me like a friend or something more   One of the best ways to find out how someone is feeling is to muster up the courage and ask It can be a difficult thing to do for both of you but it is the only way you will know for sure Here are a couple ways you can ask   Hey I have been wondering something lately Do you like me more than a friend If you like him back you could say I have been wanting to talk to you about something I have a crush on you and I was wondering if you feel the same way
It may be wise to talk to your boyfriend before embarking on the realms of physical romance He may not feel ready yet in which case kissing is best left alone  Make sure you are ready for whatever happens Know your barriers and know your comfort zone   Find a place youre not likely to be disturbed Intrusion on this special moment could be the stuff of serious embarrassment Once you are both comfortable with it you could eventually kiss in front of friends or whomever under the circumstances   To continue from here if you want to make it different and unique try a different article For a first kiss however its probably best to be simple Sometimes simple is romantic Press softly and close your eyes Tilt your head and pull them in   If youre going to do more than a peck think about kissing for about 10 seconds and then pulling apart   Think about things you will want to change the next time and such Have fun with it
If you know for a fact that the guy you like likes you back that should give you all the confidence in the world Most people arent sure at all or maybe have a hunch So act confident because confidence is attractive It will make a difference   Before you ask him tell yourself that you already have the hardest part under control Youve gotten him to like you Now you just have to act on that attraction This gets easier as time goes on The hardest part is the first time you tell him everything after that is a downhill ride  Giving him hints might even cause him to be more confident and act on his attraction and ask you out   Compliment him about something he does well but teasingly This will come off flirty and wont bother him because he wont be insecure about something hes really good at  If I would have known that youd singlehandedly destroy the other football team I wouldnt have come I like a little excitement okay   Tell him how much you appreciate him Being a little sarcastic is good but being sincere is even better  Hey thanks for helping me out with that birthday celebration You make a pretty great friend Always stay that way   Pick him up when hes down He might not show it the same way that other people show it but try to recognize when hes not feeling his best  Dont worry about Felix okay Hes a jerk and he knows it Dont let it hurt your confidence Youre way better than him anyway     Chances are youre gotten close enough to him that youre experimented a little with touching him in safe places If youve already done that great If you havent try some of these little tricks to communicate your affection before you actually come out and say it   Learn to touch his hand arm and shoulder When youre making a point reach over and casually touch his hand When youre reminding him of something or trying to be really serious touch his arm or the back of his shoulder It should send shivers down his spine Hang or rest on his shoulder Pretend to be bored and rest your head on his shoulder Or simply rest your hands on his shoulder Give him a good look in his eyes if he looks back at you   This could be a date or something that you guys regularly do like walk to the corner store for a soda He doesnt have to know that its a date but if he asks whether its a date tell him youd want it to be That will tell a guy that you like him without actually going out and saying it   You can try something like  Hey my dad got me these two tickets for a movie on Saturday but my best friend bailed so I was wondering if you wanted to be an evenbetter friend and come with me Ive been meaning to go on this hike past Malibu for ages and I need a hiking partner Are you doing anything on Sunday     This is for building rapport or chemistry You dont want to just blurt out that you like him You want to slowly build up to it waiting for just the right moment   Talk about things that he likes talking about for example Build up chemistry by asking him questions about subjects that hes enthusiastic about Once he gets going the conversation should really begin to flow and you probably wont have to do all that much talking Talk about funny things Laughter is great for chemistry Tell inside jokes that you only share with him Gently tease him remembering to touch him on the arm or shoulder Just be silly with him ask him to give you a piggyback ride or get him to do an impression of one of your teachers   Make sure you have a couple of crucial things under control right before you ask him If youre in a public place excuse yourself and go to the bathroom for a moment While youre there check   That your breath smells nice If he swoops in for a kiss you want to be ready Pop a mint into your mouth That your hair and makeup looks great Touch up your lips with a little balm not gloss and definitely not lipstick and make sure youre looking your best That youre confident If you have no confidence its best to wait until you can ask him with confidence Dont worry though you have no reason to worry   Wait for the right moment and just come out with it Maybe wait until the end of the date so theres no awkwardness after you confess your feelings and he does his Heres a couple different options   Short and sweet Maybe youve already noticed this but I really like you I was hoping you felt the same and we could do this again next weekend  Long and heartfelt This is really hard to do but I need to do it Ever since weve become friends I started liking you It came slow at first And then I noticed how funny you are and it came a little more When I really started having conversations with you I felt it even more And right now right here I feel it most of all    Youve given him the perfect opportunity to open up to you and he better take it You should be getting a really nice or even romantic response from him Remember to smile and look at his eyes This should give him the confidence to kiss you but if he doesnt dont worry   Maybe hell just plan the next date automatically after you tell him how you feel If so thats great Still he might need a little nudging In that case say something like   So I was thinking that we could do something like this again sometime Because I set this one up will you set the next one up Im really easy to please I promise Im a sucker for movies walks on the beach or shopping But I also like to be surprised

Dont plaster a goofy grin on your face though Keep it normal and relaxed Make it seem casual and make eye contact   Be cool about asking her friends so not to tip them off and go blabbering to the babe you like   For example books music etc If theres nothing you have in common now Look up something she likes and see if you might like it too Try reading The The Hobbit   Dont worry if she says no though you can always try again another time
One of the first impressions a guy has of a girl is her physical appearance Make sure you look good every day as youre never sure of when a good chance to approach your guy might pop up Clothes are a part of looking good but also make sure to be clean and appear sociable  This is the hardest and most nerve wrecking part of starting a friendship but its got to be done sometime Look for a good chance to introduce yourself perhaps when hes alone or walking down the hall Your first talk can go anywhere from a simple hey or the start of an entire conversation   If you guys have mutual friends you can have them introduce you two       If you dont know any of his friends its generally not a wise choice to interrupt him when hes with his mates That will be awkward and he wont be able to focus on getting to know you better         Once youve said hi to your guy dont just leave him hanging there Find opportunities to talk to him again and introduce yourself a bit more Look and see if hes in any of your classes and talk to him about the subject or about random things If youre lucky you can exchange phone numbers or MSN AIM Skype or OoVoo screen names Keep in touch   If you guys share a class talking about your teachers or the subject is an easy way to start a conversation From there on you can find out a few more things about him         Notice who your boy talks to Try to make friends with them too This will bring in chances for you and your guy to go out with a bunch of friends and get to know each other more Besides he will definitely appreciate you for being nice to his mates   Just like how all girls are different all guys are different as well Some guys are sensitive and need to be treated carefully some are out loud and jokey Make sure to treat your new guy friend as a real person not just as another boy Talk to him get to know his hobbies and his problems Share some of yours as well   He likes sports Mention something sportive you do and show off once in a while Acting is his thing Feel free to dramatize in a funny moment Show an interest in what he likes and maybe join a club with him Remember that to share a hobby you dont necessarily have to participate in it as well Just appreciating his liking is enough   Share a few funny moments between the two of you and keep it going as an inside joke Itll entertain the both of you and make it feel like youre keeping a secret always something good to have   Once you know him as a friend stay in contact A friendship is a longterm thing like wine it ripens with old age Be a good friend
Ask one of your friends or a friend of the guy who likes you to try talking to him about how youâre not interested and he should give it up He might listen better when it comes from someone else   Also ask your friends or his friends to stop making jokes about the two of you getting together or any other encouragement they try to give him The guy that likes you might just want the attention or be pursuing you because his friends egg him on   If you feel really annoyed or threatened by him itâs a good time to talk to a parent or other adult for more help Just tell them that thereâs a guy who likes you and wonât leave you alone The adult can offer you more advice or talk to the guy or his parents   If you feel uncomfortable talking to a parent or other adult try writing down what you want to say first before you say it Also decide what you want from the adult beforehand so you can ask them Say âI just want you to help me figure out what to do about somethingâ or âI need you to talk to someoneâs parents for meâ If a guy still persists with unwanted attention in any way after youâve made it clear with your speech and actions that you arenât interested talks or sends messages in a way that is threatening or shows up at your house or somewhere to see you uninvited speak up and tell the police
When you form a friendship with him it is okay to create reasons to get together The more time you spend with him the better He may not be interested in you yet but you should take this time to comfortably show him your personality and truly get to know him  This part is very important and only possible if youâre friends with him Mention his crush in a conversation and see what he says Donât settle for answers about how physically attractive she is There must be more to her that he is attracted to you and you have to find out what those traits are   Donât speak poorly of her You may think that this will make her look bad but youâll be the one looking bad in the end If you speak poorly of her heâll think youâre a negative person Plus guys love a supportive girl If youâre bashing his opinions youâre only hurting yourself   While you donât want to speak poorly of his current crush you can start to get his mind out of that relationship by talking him up Tell him that heâs the full package and that he deserves the best Tell him not to settle and that he should go after someone that he is friends with because the relationship will be stronger if that connection is already existent   While youâre still in the âfriend zoneâ it is a great time to show him your playful side Guys like a girl that laughs at his jokes They are intrigued by girls that arenât always serious about everything   While being his friend you should have learned his likes and dislikesâabout girls and in general Use these things to your advantage Show him that the two of you have similar interests in hobbies or activities Also show him that you have the personality traits that he is attracted to   Donât lose the friendship that you have created This shows him that you appreciate him as a person When he realizes that you are attracted to him it will help create the image of you as âthe whole packageâ Men want to be with someone that they are friends with and are attracted to   While you want to adopt the personality traits that heâs attracted to you donât want to completely change who you are Find a way to merge the traits that he likes with your own This way the relationship has a chance longterm   When he first told you what he was attracted to in his crush he probably mentioned a specific look that he liked Try to mimic it If he said that he liked a certain part of her body try to accentuate yours through your outfit Guys are undoubtedly attracted by looks so make yourself appealing to him Make your conversations flirty Lean into him more when the two of you talk keep laughing at his jokes and create a physical connection You can touch his shoulder when youâre laughing take his hand to lead him somewhere or run your hand through his hair and comment on how nice it is   He will love your compliments because heâll trust you as a friend that they are genuine Also it will show him that you notice his physical appearance When you compliment him he may feel the need to give one back which gets him looking at you
You should try to get your boyfriend in a romantic mood first and lower the pressure with a few slower warm up kisses first Make these a few soft pecks after its clear hes in the mood to kissPerhaps your boyfriend will start French kissing you without being asked if you seem receptive enough during the first kisses The best approach is to wait a bit and see if it happens on its own You will know he wants to kiss you when you make eye contact and one or both of you moves closer to the other Tilt your head to the side and part your lips Gently draw one of your boyfriendâs lips between your own as you kiss so your lips interlock a bit Donât be afraid to tilt your head a bit as this will signal renewed interest You could say Lets go slow to be clearer to your boyfriend especially if he is inexperienced at kissing or you are You could also acknowledge your nervousness by saying something like Hey Im a little nervous Are you too He may appreciate your honesty Remember he might be just as nervous as you are If hes a more experienced kisser telling him something like I love kissing slowly at first can help set the mood  Because French kissing involves kissing with tongues if you rub your tongue over your partnerâs lips it will give him the signal that youâre OK with French kissingDo this lightly because it will be romantic to your partner and a bit teasing Thatâs good Sometimes your boyfriend might feel insecure and is looking to see if youâre all right with it You could say something like You have really nice lips as you rub your tongue over them looking him briefly in the eye Feel free then to gently push the tip of your tongue into your partnerâs mouth If your partner has any experience he will probably then move his tongue deeper into your mouth   You could just come out and ask Remember that hes probably nervous too   If youre kissing slowly and gently at first more nibbling than French kissing you could take a small step back look him deeply in the eyes and say Id love to French kiss you right now but Im nervous because Ive never done it before Could you show me how Or you could say something like Want to try French kissing I would love to try that with you If youre worried about bad breath just make sure you pop a mint or brush your teeth or spray mouth freshener into your mouth before the kissing starts   If youâre really nervous because youâve never French kissed before itâs OK for you to tell him that Find the right place and time which is when you are both alone and comfortable with each other   It might feel embarrassing at first but he will probably appreciate your honesty and it might excite him to think that he will be the first person to French kiss you Its a good idea to have this conversation before you actually are kissing Find a casual way to say it For example while youre driving in a car or eating dinner together you could say This is hard for me to say but Ive never French kissed before Maybe you can show me how later Dont make it overly serious You could also start the conversation with a question by asking him if he knows how to French kiss This might entice him to show you how to French kiss Remember that the best relationships are built upon a foundation of strong communication anyway Its best to wait until youve been dating for a little bit before you have this conversation though   What if your boyfriend is not ready for French kissing Thats OK Everyone needs to go at his or her own pace   Your boyfriend might just be nervous so dont read too much into it if your boyfriend hasnt French kissed you unless youve been going out for months In that case you could ask why your boyfriend feels that way If the relationship is new you could just let the French kissing happen naturally Let your boyfriend take the lead on it and if hes not ready work on building your bond and connection by sharing time together and great conversations rather than forcing the kissing

Before you can think of getting others to fall for your charms first you must look to yourself Contrary to what you might believe theres much much more to looks than appearance Nice clothes and style are a start but nothing can replace a good attitude and selfrespect Girls can pick up when a guy doesnt believe in himself and theres nothing as attractive as a girl who knows shes worth it Regardless of your gender or the person youre trying to impress confidence is an essential starting point   For many people learning to find confidence in themselves may be the hardest part of this entire process If youre having trouble feeling secure in your chances of success try writing down a list of things you like about yourself and a list of personal qualities eg a great sense of humour beautiful smile etc your crush would like you for Dont worry if youre shy you can still show plenty of confidence if youre on the introverted side Guys can feel really flattered if you feel slightly nervous around them If youre a shy guy you might find girls are attracted to you for your mystery Your best bet is to take comfort in what comes most naturally to you  Do some research into different styles Try to recognize which styles appeal most to you and which you think might look best on you If youre having trouble ask one of your friends for advice theyre there for a reason and chances are theyll have plenty of warm suggestions to help you spruce up your style   Dont try to overdo it with your appearance Find a look thats fashionable but ultimately casual You dont want to end up scaring your crush away   Nothing refreshes attention like a fresh new hairdo This way even if youve known him for a while he will have to reconsider his impression of you Who knows you may have found your new favourite look   Chances are you may be feeling stressed excited uncertain or a mixture of all three due to your crush Although its natural to feel some embarrassment about having a crush you may find it helps alleviate the strain to open up about it with a few close friends Especially if they know your crush they may be able to lend specificallytailored advice to your situation If anything putting your feelings into words for the first time may help you make better sense of what you stand   If you decide to tell friends about your crush whether for advice or simply to vent make sure not to word the situation in bleak fatalistic terms Although you may feel pessimistic its much better to talk about it constructively Not only will this positively correlate with the helpfulness of the advice your friends give you thinking positively will also give you more confidence with your crush Make sure youre confiding in someone you can trust If you have any doubt they might spread word of your feelings around or even tell your crush prematurely it may be do more harm than good If you have any doubts its best to keep any talk limited to your mosttrusted friends   This could mean anything do you go to the same school Are you neighbours In virtually every circumstance there are plenty of opportunities to get on that persons radar A great start is to put yourself in his general area Find out what events hell be attending or where he eats lunch The more youre around him the more opportunities youll have to interact with one another The universal gesture of kindness there is nothing so simple and profoundly effective in winning your crush as a smile Whenever you see him make sure to flash him a smile While it might be hard if youre shy you should find it gets easier very quickly The reaction will almost certainly be positive   If for whatever reason he doesnt smile back dont worry about it There could be a number of reasons he didnt reciprocate the gesture You may have caught him off guard its also possible that hes simply shy Interpreting his actions as a sign hes uninterested in you should only be a last resort   It sounds simple but you might be surprised how many people tend to overlook this easy though crucial step Once youre in his vicinity there should be plenty of opportunities to say hello Dont feel selfconscious in doing this very seldom does anyone respond negatively to a simple act of attention and positive feeling   There are a virtually infinite number of ways you can do this Look to your surroundings and circumstances for something general to talk about For example   If youve got a class together Hey would I be able to share notes with you I want to see if I missed anything If youre at a librarytheatre Any books or movies you could recommend me If youre at a sports game Hey Which team are you part ofrooting for At a party Hey How did you hear about this party   A crucial common mistake to make is to be too modest about your feelings If you dont show signs of attraction he might not get the impression you are interested in him Although you want to make sure not to get direct with it quite yet there are plenty of things you can do to show interest If you are relaxed enough chances are youre exhibiting some of these traits already   If youre a girl Twirling your hair while talking to him If youre a guy Keeping a strong posture around her Maintaining eye contact and smiling at him Keeping your feet pointing in his direction Making light bodily contact like touching his arm or shoulder   Soon enough youll need to get your relation at a more substantive point where you can move past icebreakers and learn about him in greater depth While the traditional thing to do in the past was for one party to ask the other on a date there are countless options for you to pursue in this respect   Although it sounds impersonal talking online is a great noncommittal way to get to know someone pretty effectively Things some people might have trouble discussing in person are much more easily divulged online If you go to school together you might ask Want to eat lunch together sometime Again this is a casual easygoing way to get to know someone a lot better While you may feel obliged to wait for your crush to ask you out on a date hinging upon social norms is a waste of time If youre confident enough in your feelings asking him to go out with you some night is a great way to demonstrate your confidence and make progress with impressing your crush   Although the media would suggest that guys will be interested if you play hard to get this is commonly interpreted as being standoffish The best way to impress a guy is to be nice to him Treat him at first as you would a friend While youre still becoming comfortable with him theres no need to put added pressure on your interactions   This step is no less important if youre a guy The phrase Nice guys finish last is very misleading girls are going to want to be around someone who makes them feel good about themselves Giving your crush compliments like I love your hair or How did you get such good fashion sense will go a long way towards making him feel great in your company  Dont be afraid to ask questions no matter how direct it might seem Theres a good chance hell feel flattered by the interest youre investing in them Asking questions is a great way to spark a wider range of conversations They dont have to be anything superimportant to start youre mostly looking to become comfortable and possibly springboard into deeper subjects If youre looking for examples here are a few to get you started   Whats your family like Any pets What do youwould you like to do for a living If you attend the same school What are your favourite classes Make sure to do some of the talking as well No doubt there are plenty of things he would love to know about you This way it will feel more like a conversation and less like an interrogation   What are you interested in Crochet knitting Horror films Avantgarde jazz fusion Chances are you already share some of your unique interests with your crush without knowing it Finding out a bit more about what he likes can offer a perfect opportunity to bond   Your circumstances of meeting can help inform your initial investigations into his interests If you met at a rock concert for example theres a hefty probability you share musical interests The same goes for an arts fair a movie theatre or a sports event If you dont have any apparent interests in common you can try opening yourself to things hes interested in Ask him why hes into certain things and see if you can see the appeal in it If nothing else the fact that youre making the initiative will demonstrate to him that you care   While every strong romantic connection initially has a basis in friendship at some point you should begin to emphasize that your feelings are more than that Youll know youve spent enough time getting to know each other when this step feels more natural than contrived Try saying things like   You know I think youre actually pretty cute Its really attractive that youre so passionate about your interests Or even a simple I really enjoy spending time with you   Now that youve fostered a strong foundation for your interactions dont be afraid to become increasingly forward with your attraction towards your crush   Hugging compliments and smiling are all valid forms of flirting Use the pushpull mechanicWhether youre a guy or a girl this simple trick might work to get your crush interested in you give him a compliment and boost his ego Upon doing that back away and give him the cold shoulder If done correctly this will make him seek your approval and affection Give it a try and see how it goes Dont feel too discouraged if he doesnt reciprocate these advances at first Its quite possible hes been taken off guard by how upfront you are and it may take him some time to adjust   Let your crush know how you really feel about him This is the moment of truth However after the time you two have spent getting to know one another and flirting you might find this stage happens much more smoothly than you would have ever anticipated at the start If the chemistry between you two is right dont be surprised if your crush develops into a lifechanging relationship   The easiest way to go about this is to tell him directly Dont mince words I have feelings for you or I like you in a way thats more than just friends If youre feeling particularly bold planting a kiss on his cheek can leave a big impression If for whatever reason your crush rejects you dont sweat it There could be a million possible reasons why someone might not be interested in pursuing a relationship and most of them have nothing to do with you If things go sour for whatever reason remember not to let it keep you from loving yourself and being open to whatever comes next in life
If you make an effort to show you love once a day whether with a goodnight I love you or by simply putting his toothpaste on his brush for him youll keep the relationship strong for a long time If youre worried about showing your affection just think about finding one time a day where you can Even an extralong passionate kiss is a great way to slow down time with your man for a halfsecond  Some people have a hard time saying the words I love you But that doesnt mean that they dont love their partner If youre someone who struggles a bit with showing affection try these little techniques to let someone know you care   Hold or squeezing hands Make plans together for the future even just future dates Introduce your friends andor family Surprise him with kisses hugs and affection Give compliments encouragement and admiration Do little favors for him especially when he seems upset It sounds paradoxical but sometimes the best thing you can do is not see him at all Remember  you fell in love as separate people with separate lives  you need to preserve some of this independence to stay happy and in love Dont feel like you need to talk or check in constantly to show how much you care Sometimes giving each other some free time is the best way to show you know and love someone  Do not avoid fights or issues just by saying I love you and accepting your concerns The most inlove couples have arguments too and you need to air them out openly and honestly to keep your love alive So dont feel like youre destroying your love or going back on your word if you bring up a disagreement or issue  youre just showing your love in another way   Dont ever let a partner get you to do something you dont want to to prove your love Love doesnt need to be proven Everyone has different comfort levels when it comes to saying I love you There are those that say it after every phone call and those that only save it for special moments and there is everything in between So dont worry about how often you should say I love you or how often you hear it  people are different and show their love in different ways These words mean much more when you mean them If you only say I love you when youre feeling full of love youll both be much happier
The location helps to set the right mood for intimate encounters Dont choose places like loud parties that may make you feel under pressure or places in public that would be awkward Instead find a secluded area in order to create a good setting for you to make your move Whether youre taking a stroll in the park or heading off somewhere be sure that you both are away from people He will be less likely to kiss you if there are others watching himWherever you choose to be make sure you can talk and see one another easily so that you he can gauge your kissme vibes If you are having trouble getting him alone tell him I want some fresh air Would you like to come with me   For a positive conversation open yourself up to a variety of subjects in order to keep him interested Be sure that you have a list of topics or questions to discuss with the boy While its important to listen to him you must also talk in order to have a successful fascinating conversation   When youre talking initiate light contact by touching his arm Make eye contact in order to appear interested in what he is saying Smile at him once in a while to assure him that you are comfortable around him Dont hesitate to tease him lightly or laugh at his jokes   Keep your flirting subtle to avoid scaring him away   Half the battle of kissing someone is getting close to their face If you keep a close proximity to his face then he can more easily gather the courage to kiss you If he is not being forward enough you may have to initiate the kiss Be sure that the mood is light and happy Smile at him before moving closer to him in order to show that you are open to him Look up into his eyes for a moment smile and glance down at his lips If he doesnt move forward lean forward and lightly press your lips to his
Since theyâre your crush you probably have a general idea of their schedule Think about when youâll see them in class in the hall or during free periods Figure out a time when you know youâll be around them and will have time to strike up a conversation   Use common sense and change your plans if you need to If you planned to talk to them at recess but see them cramming for a test or having a heated discussion with a friend postpone your chat You donât want to force them into a conversation when theyâre busy  A nice Hey Whats up works as a conversation starter in almost any situation Itâs an informal way to start the conversation rather than launching into a preplanned spiel Additionally your crush might let you know if it is a good time to talk or not If they say âIâm just in a hurry to meet someone at the libraryâ then you know it might not be a great time   It may sound silly but using your crushs name can induce some warm fuzzy feelings right off the bat Saying Hey Brad sounds much more personal than Hey If you cant make Whats up flow off the tongue naturally open with anything that feels natural to you You can say something like Are you excited for class today Did you watch the new episode last night or anything else that can smoothly start a conversation   It doesnât have to be anything major but itâs an easy way to get in their good graces right from the start and hopefully launch into a fullfledged conversation You can tell them that you like their new haircut a piece of clothing or any other appearancerelated thing Noticing something and complimenting it shows your crush that you pay attention and provides them with the opportunity to tell you about itIf applicable you could also mention a recent accomplishment or noteworthy achievement of your crush You can say anything from Congrats on winning that football game last Saturday I heard you played great to âI liked what you said in class today and I totally agreedâ   If they engage in conversation with you but continuously look at their phones glance over their shoulder or angle their body towards the closest exit wrap it upThey might be saying friendly things but their focus is not in the conversation for whatever reason If they are facing you listening to what youâre saying and making eye contact proceed   This could be anything from the crazy history teacher you both have Monday morning to how your little brothers are best friends Finding common ground is a great way to not only find something to talk about but to forge a real connectionIf you cant think of common ground create some If you donât have any of the same classes or social circles find something to connect over If you know he absolutely loves a certain genre of music tell him you started listening to it and want some recommendations If you know he is passionate about a cause ask him how you can learn more and get involved It doesnât matter if you are total oppositesâ find something that you can bring up to relate to him and bond over somethingNot only will you show your crush that youâve taken note of what he is interested in you can also truly learn something new about both him and about whatever subject matter you discuss   If youâre shy and this is your first time speaking to your crush conquering your fear and talking to them is a victory in itself If you want to take it a step further try to find a âto be continuedââ moment For example if you discuss a television show you both enjoy say something along the lines of âWell we will have to discuss again after next weekâs episodeâ This ensures that you will talk to them again   If youâre bold you can ask for their phone number social media info or email address Then you can continue chatting outside of school   This is the next step if youre feeling particularly bold Even if itâs something simple like studying for the exam you both have it will guarantee that youâll get more face time with your crush This doesnât have to be a date  it can still just be two people getting to know each other better The romantic part may come later   No matter how eager you are to talk to them more and spend time with them it is best to let things evolve naturally Donât hit them up for their phone number three minutes after meeting them   Sometimes it helps to get your confidence up before approaching your crush at all Do whatever you need to do to make yourself feel goodâ wear a new tshirt spend a little extra time doing your hair or pump yourself up with your favorite song Embrace those days when you just feel great about yourself and strike up a conversation then If you feel good youâll exude that confidenceWearing a lucky shirt standing up straight and visualizing a great conversation in your head are all additional ways to give yourself that boost of confidence you need If doesnât matter what you do to feel good just do it   No matter how cute smart funny or cool your crush seems they are a person just like you They feel awkward sometimes they want to be liked and they want to make friends just like you do Try not to put them on a pedestal because it will only make talking to them even more intimidating   For all you know theyâve been admiring you from afar this whole time You owe it to both of you to try No matter how anxious or shy you may feel on the inside itâs important to look like youâre calm cool and collected Flash them a big smile and try to look at them when you speak Show them that youâre sure of yourself and they will automatically be impressedWhen you speak to your crush make sure that youre facing them speak loud enough to be understood and use a friendly tone You can also lean towards them to better hear what theyre saying If you look terrified theyâll most likely feel a bit awkward Camouflage your nervousness and summon up all of your confidence   You are a smart capable and charming person Think of your best qualities and all the wonderful things you have to offer the people around you Love and appreciate your strengths and thats all that matters Your crush will either see that and be grateful to speak with you or they will be silly and its their loss Go forth and conquer   Also try to calm yourself down right before you talk to your crush Whether you listen to some calming music go on a walk have a quick chat with a good friend or watch a funny video calming yourself down will help you get rid of the jitters that can come with talking to your crush
Some entire movies are improvised some plays are Sometimes a group gets together to improvise one scene or find ways to improve a scene Sometimes a drama lesson can be a while series of different improvised scenes A class leader may ask everyone to stand and improvise a moonwalk as an ice breaker You might be put into small groups and given a set time to put together a scene Improvisation covers a lot Make sure you know exactly what you have to be good at  Often in improvisation you will be given a topic or scenario which determines what where and who you are Stay in character Whoever has decided the scenario wants to see your interpretation of it not something completely off topic that you prefer to perform Keep it appropriate Dont introduce the fact you have a super power if you are supposed to be showing how to close a sale or pretend the room is starting to flood when youre meant to be being your interpretation of a clock that needs winding   Yes some amusing words may get a laugh but dont lose a good story line by trying to be too funny unless thats your character If you work with a partner dont end up in a comedy contest trying to be better than your partner   Focus on your acting not the audience   Dont let fear hold you back It can be scary to stand up in front of a crowd Take a speech class to practice this and help you get over stage fright   If someone in your group says Im the best soccer player ever dont cut himher off and say Really I thought you were a gymnast because you know thats what they really do Remember the rest of the groups is improvising too   That always ends the show Being energetic is great in the right situation but screaming and shouting or running around excessively just isnt always realistic   Being nervous can ruin the improvised scene Relaxing and enjoying yourself can make the audience enjoy you   Imagine how that character would move would react would speak would think would feel Show that in your actions   There are a lot of improvisation games that were show cased in the popular TV show Whos Line is it Anyway Research that Or try other options such acting a scene where everyone who speaks has to include a colour in their sentences Or you can start a scene and as soon as the actors are in an opportune position someone says pause takes a character out and starts the scene again at a completely different situations inspired by the position of the actors
If your crush is around and you start feeling overwhelmed force yourself to pay attention to something else Get out your class notes and study for an upcoming exam Read a book Talk to a friend If youâre in class focus on your teacherâs lecture If youâre not in class calltext a friend or play a game   Even if you end up staring blankly at a page and not reading a word it will still help you keep your feelings private and under control   If you find another outlet for your emotions it can help you cope with them better Lots of people find that journaling helps them sort out their feelings   You could also try a creative activity like painting or writing a songPhysical activities can also help you deal with emotions Go for a run or try a new sport   Trying something new will help you focus on something else Try to immerse yourself in things that will get you out of the house and around other people   When you find yourself thinking about your crush actively engage your mind with something else
Itâs a good idea to put on the bridle before purchasing it to make sure it fits Make sure your bridle is loose before attempting to put it on your horse If itâs too tight it will hurt the horse and you may meet more resistance   Hold onto the halter or the horseâs mane to keep it restrained while putting on the bridlePut the reins over the horseâs head This will allow you to restrain the horse without using the halterPosition the crownpiece between the horseâs ears Put your right arm around the horseâs neck and between the ears holding the bridle by the crownpiece in your right hand Then hold the bridle so that the bit is positioned over the mouth With your right hand on the crownpiece grab the bit with your left hand and move it towards the horseâs mouth If your horse is welltrained you should be able to just touch the horseâs lips to indicate that the mouth needs to openIf your horse doesnât open his or her mouth try putting your thumb and little finger behind the horseâs incisors to coax the mouth open without getting bitten Once the horseâs mouth is open put in the bit   Once the bridle is on youâll have to adjust the throatlatch noseband and cheekpiecesFor the noseband make sure there is about two or three fingersâ width of slack If the noseband is too tight the horse wonât be able to open its mouth If the throatlatch is too tight the horse wonât be able to breath You should be able to fit three fingers between the horseâs throat and the strap The cheekpieces should be tight enough so that the bit is held firmly in place
One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless Remind yourself that no one is flawless Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationshipTry having a conversation about weaknesses He probably knows his flaws best and learning this information from him might help to ground you Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesnât assume that youâre perfect either   When youâre in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest you can be blind to the reality of relationships Look back briefly on past experiences that didnât quite work out in your favor Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like Ask yourself if youre willing to go through that pain again Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again When youâre really starting to develop feelings sometimes itâs hard to stay true to who you are You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationshipâs development While this might get his interest in the short term itâll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country It might take longer for him to know if the two of you are compatible enough but this slower progression is more healthy and natural and if things finally do progress youâll know itâs for the right reasons
If you find that sheâs on her best behavior when you are around that is a good sign However donât take it to heart if she is brief with you sometimes She might seem in a hurry or she might not want to be around you right at that moment Sometimes she might just be grumpy or having a bad day Pay attention the theme of your conversations not one specific instance   For example if she tries to engage you in interesting conversations then she probably thinks you are interesting   If youre always the one to talk to her she might assume she doesnât have to put any work into the relationship Talk to her a few times and then leave the door open for her to start a conversation with you If she doesnât then she probably doesnât want to talk to you anymore For example if she asks you how your soccer game went or your piano recital it means she is paying attention to your interests Thats a good sign   If she likes you she might ask for help on a lot of things She might ask you for help on the new homework in the hall just so she can get closer to you   She might ask you a lot of questions about your interests She might even just say something about how sheâs excited youâll be living in the same neighborhood next year or something like that Keep an eye out for these clues If she is a straight A student and she asks you for the history assignment she probably already has it and she just wanted to talk to you But be careful she might really need help so dont get your hopes up too high   This sounds simple but honestly sometimes the simplest clues are the most important ones If she is nice to you and asks questions she probably likes you Thereâs a myth that sometimes girls will act mean to you to get your attention Thatâs not true They might tease you flirtatiously but they arenât going to outright insult you Take the teasing in stride because itâs probably a good sign For example if she teases you for being late to school that day she might like you If she tells you youre dumb because you failed a test she probably doesnt
Tell him that it looks really interesting After youve told him this ask about the author or artistband of the songbook This should get the conversation going if he really likes the particular authorsingerband If he doesnt know much about them say something like Hey insert bandsingerauthor here sounds a lot like a different bandsingerauthor here  If he is really friendly and outgoing hell probably say hello If he doesnt you say hi This way you can pretend that you arent trying to talk to him because you like him but just because youre just bored and have nothing to do but to talk to him or you can pretend that youre just being friendly   If you have trouble with math and hes a math whiz ask him to help you with the math If youre carrying something heavy then ask him to help you carry it This sets you up for a conversation in a nonawkward way Dont forget to thank him after   Say Oops sorry Dont just walk into him blush and walk away After youve apologized for bumping into him say Hi my names _____ Whats yours If you know his name already but hes new or youre new say Hi Im _____ Youre _______ right If that wont really work make a comment about something funny that happened in class some bizarre rumour that obviously isnt real the amount of homework that the teachers give you the weather how awesome they did on their school project or at their football game etc   Here are some examples   If your crush did awesome at a sport event football lets say say to him Wow you did awesome at the football game on Friday Can you give me some tips on how to play football as well as you did       If your crush did a great school presentation or speech say to him Hey I loved your speechpresentation on name school presentation here I need some help in the public speaking area and you seem like the best person to ask for advice about this stuff so could you give me some tips       If you know for some reason that your crush got a good grade on his math test say Hi I heard that you did great on your math test Great job I have a couple of tests coming up maybe you could give me some tips about how I could do as well       If you heard that they aced a job interview say Hiya I heard that you did great on your job interview I have one coming up so how did you do so awesome on it         Note that this isnt likely set up a real conversation unless you do this before class has started but it might let him know that youre interested and this is good because he will most likely want to talk to you more if he thinks this
If your friend is suddenly seizing every opportunity to hang out with you on your own then it means that they want to take things to the next level If before youâve mostly done the âgroup hangâ thing and now they are asking you to go to the movies to grab coffee or even to have dinner then thatâs just one step away from asking you for a date   If before when you hung out in groups you were just laughing and hanging out with all of your friends equally and now you suddenly see that your friend is always at your side making eye contact or playfully touching you then it may mean that they want to be more than just friends   Take a look at your friend next time youâre in a group situation See if you can catch them staring at you If they blush when you catch them then this makes it even more likely that they may want something more from you   If your friend was once very open and candid about everything and is suddenly acting more modest around you then it may mean that they are suddenly feeling more bashful in your presence because they have a big crush on you If your friend is a guy and he stops his usual loud burping or vulgar jokes then he may be crushing on you   If your friend is a girl and she suddenly looks down at the floor more or is less eager to reveal the details of her latest date then it may be because she only wants you to be in her personal life
When you see your crush grab his gaze and hold it Smile at him Hold that look for a few seconds and then look away Repeat it again and if heâs interested heâll mirror your cues   Use the flick technique Meet his eyes let your gaze fall to his mouth and then lift them so that your eyes meet his again Pair that with a coy grinWhen you know heâs watching you play with your hair a little This lets him know that you notice him noticing you  Fake it till you make it The more you allow yourself to relax into the situation and feel comfortable with it the more confident you will seem Confidence is an aphrodisiac for men so use it generously   Donât fidget with or hide your hands as its often a sign of nervousness Place them on your hips or leave them out in the open to promote better posture and signal to him that you are open Keep your chin up and eyes level at all times even as you walk to project confidence Take care of your appearance Groom with products that leave you smelling good and feeling good like conditioners lotions fragrances etc Pay attention to the details   Heâll remember you from your back and forth looks Comment offhandedly about something in class or make a joke This takes the pressure off an initial oneonone encounter and can feel a lot more organic than the individual approach attempt   If youâre feeling brave approach him directly If not make approaching him more comfortable by setting the scene The setup will provide the icebreaker you need to get the conversation going   Bump into him and apologize frantically Place your hand in your hair and laugh at yourself for running into him Drop something like a book or a pen as you walk past him He will either run after you to return it to you or you can retrieve it yourself and explain that you are clumsy   This will always be the boldest move because itâs direct straightforward and lacks the presence of games The simplest thing to say is âHi Iâm Ashley whatâs your nameâIf inperson introductions intimidate you create an indirect approach to introducing yourself Add him on Facebook or Instagram Message him directly by giving your name and telling him where he might know you from school or work Tell him you have noticed him from afar and have been dying to talk to him and let him know your name Direct message him on Twitter introducing yourself as his classmate or coworker Ashley Use your shyness to your advantage by saying that he makes you so shy in person that Twitter messaging became the next best thing to hello Get his number from a mutual friend This one is a little risky because a lot of people do not like to have their numbers handed out if it is not from them directly but if you make up a good excuse you might be able to make this move work in your favor Apologize for having his number and tell him that you missed notes in class heard he would have them and really need it to study for an upcoming test This looks more proactive less crazy so if youâre going to text him make sure you have a reason and take the conversation from there   Light topics will always be easier to expound upon into deeper topics later Ask about the weather or ask if he went to the schoolâs last game Ask him how heâs doing today or what heâs up to   âWhat kind of day are you havingâ âWhat are you studyingâ âWhere do you workâ âWhat are you doing laterâ   Ask questions that are openended and lead to him describing his likes and dislikes his passions and his interests Listen to his responses more than you speak âWhat kind of movies do you like What are your favoritesâ âWhat do you like to read in your spare timeâ âWhat is the most beautiful place youâve ever beenâ âWhere do you plan to travel to this yearâ âWhatâs one thing that youâre really really good atâ   Men like praise and appreciation as much as women do The act itself puts into words your interest in him Slip into the conversation organically and limit the compliments to a couple at a timeIf he smiles while youâre talking âYou have an incredible smileâ If he laughs at something funny âYour laugh is musicâ If he has a great sense of humor âYou are really funnyâ If you like what heâs wearing âYou have really great styleâ If you want to mention his looks but not directly wait for him to do something thatâs cute like talking about a hobby passionately âYouâre so cuteâ   Make things feel less formal and less like an interview by making conversation a twoway street If he asks questions about you because heâs interested and wants to know more answer honestly and confidently   Connect a shared passion or interest with a personal story to deepen the emotional connection between you two Allow him to get to know who you are and decide if he likes what he likes   Stare in his eyes intensely Use body language to show him your interest Touch him lightly on the arm or accidentally touch his leg knees or feet with yours   Now that momentum has been made with creating a foundation for friendship see if thereâs more there by hanging out oneonone in a more intimate setting Connection continues to build the more you bond through shared activitiesGrab a bite to eat somewhere just the two of you Find a less pressured date setting by going hiking or doing something active like racquetball Consider volunteering together to build houses or feed the hungry
Dont worry about saying the best thing Just say âHiâ or if a guy is wearing a nice shirt compliment him by saying âI like your shirtâ Ask how his weekend went by saying âDid you do anything fun this weekendâ Whatever you say say it with a smile and try to stay calmYou can talk about a class you share Try saying something like Howd you do on the test in math If you notice they have a phone case or tshirt or talk about your favorite band say I really like them too Did you know theyre coming to town next week  Reach out first through social media like Facebook or Twitter Chatting online can be much easier than in real life because you can think of what you want to say before you say it without awkward silences This lets you get to know him better so itâs easier to talk in person later onIf youre messaging a guy for the first time online say hi and remind them how they know you Say something like Hi we have math class together Have you studied for the test yet You can also bring up a common interest by saying something like Did I see you at the new comic book movie this weekend If youre having a get together or party inviting the guy online is a great first move Say something like Hey Im having people over this weekend for a back to school party and it would be great if you could come   This is a great way to be more outgoing with guys without having to say a lot When you ask questions people feel youâre interested in them and they may be more willing to talk You can say something as simple as âHow did you like the book we read in Englishâ This will start a conversation and you can listen quietly which may help to calm your nervesDonât ask random questions Going up to someone and saying âWhatâs your favorite colorâ is not likely to get much of a response Instead ask questions about a class or shared interest so it makes sense for you to ask and for him to answer Listen when they respond Itâs easier to come up with additional questions or insightful responses if youâre actually paying attention to what they say to you Plus no one likes to feel ignored especially by someone who asked him a question to begin with This is generally a less awkward situation because if you feel shy or canât think of anything else to say there are other people to fill the silence Having your friends there for support will also make you feel sure of yourself so itâs easier to talk openly This is a great way to meet people and in most cases thereâs a builtin topic of conversation Sometimes thereâs even a specific agenda of subjects that have to be covered Talking to a guy who you know shares at least one interest may be easier than just approaching guys if you feel shy around themIf its your first meeting with the club say something like I just joined this club How long have you been involved You can ask a guy something like What go you interested in French club If you have an upcoming even with the club you can ask Are you going to the service project this weekend

You need a reason to break up with her even if your feelings have simply changed and she hasnt done something wrong When youre in a relationship with someone you owe it to them explain yourself Youd want a reason if you were being broken up with wouldnt you   Here are some common reasons that people break up with one another   Cheating A relationship is between two people Threes a crowd  Disrespect Your partner doesnt treat you the way you know you should be treated  Manipulative relationship Your partner manipulates you to get what she wants  Falling out of love You realize after time that you dont have feelings for her the way you used to in the beginning  Distance The physical distance between you two makes it hard for a relationship to happen Boredom When you are not just enjoying the time you spend with each other    Breaking up in person can be really hard but again you definitely owe it to her Where you do it can be virtually anywhere â a room a park or a schoolyard so long as theres not much to distract you while you break the news   A quiet public place might be good for two reasons Its harder to fight in public places because you have everyone looking at you The breakup will usually take less time if you do it in public Never break up over text or email Try not to break up over the phone These methods can reflect poorly on you and your soontobe ex will probably let every girl know what you did   Its not easy but ripping the bandaid off quickly will be less painful for both parties than dragging your feet in the mud If you can go right out and say it   Example I hate to do this because youve meant so much to me but I think we should break up  Example Im really struggling with this right now so I apologize if this doesnt come out in a good way but I think we should call things quits  Example Maybe this wont come as a huge surprise to you but I think its best if we called things off between us    Tell it like it is Draw on the reasons you came for why you want to break up leaning on them Give her a full explanation but dont list every single part of the relationship that was bad or out of whack â it could cause her to become angry and combative   Example I know its not what you wanted to hear and if I could change the way I feel I would The truth is I dont know if were really compatible I dont get along with your friends you dont get along with mine You hate sports I live for them I tried to ignore our differences in the beginning but I cant anymore I honestly think you and I both would be happier with someone else    If your girlfriend cheated on you manipulated you or disrespected you there may not be anything you need to take responsibility or apologize for On the other hand relationships are usually twoway streets her actions are affected by your actions which means you might bear some responsibility for what went wrong in the relationship Own up to it if you feel you should   Example I know I deserve some of the blame I shouldnt have let you disrespect me or my friends I could have told you it bothered me and maybe you would have changed But its become such a problem now that I dont think we can change it anymore  Example Part of it is my fault I pushed you away when you really needed someone and I guess you could say that I pushed you right into his arms I understand why you did it but I cant forgive you right now Hopefully sometime in the future Ill be able to    Breakup speeches can escalate or go wrong in so many different ways The key is to stay calm put yourself in the other persons shoes and try not to win the argument Shell probably counter with some other facts she may even call you names You probably would too right Think about what she has to say dont lose your temper and try your best not to make her feel bad   If youre genuinely sad that youre breaking up and you think it might comfort her show some gentle affection Ask her if you can give her a hug put an arm on her shoulder look into her eyes and offer her a heartfelt smile These gestures can go a long way toward reassuring her in a tough time   She might have questions answer them truthfully She might have a different side of the story she wants to tell listen to her Let her get things off her chest   If you notice the argument going in circles and circles tell her gently I know this is hard but I feel were just going around in circles Can I give you some time to think about it  Offer her the opportunity to discuss things at a later time Say something like I know this is a lot to process at once It is for me too Maybe you want to talk about it a bit later when emotions arent going everywhere at once    There probably isnt a breakup protocol but there are definitely things that you shouldnt do when breaking up with anyone no matter who they are to you They include   Dont lead her on If you dont think its a good idea to stay friends after a breakup say so Its better than giving her false hope Dont be a tattletale Theres a saying loose lips sink ships Well its not that serious but what happens between you and her is no one elses business Its okay to tell your good friends but dont go telling everyone every single detail of the breakup Dont get with someone else before you break up Thats what is called cheating Have a little bit of patience and wait until youve broken up if youre in love with someone else Dont use the breakup as an excuse to treat them badly Whatever they might have done to you its honestly not worth it trying to make their life hell Have respect and treat them the way that youd want to be treated Itll make the breakup easier on both of you
If youre excited to be around your guy and only feel your excitement build after you spend more time together then chances are you have a crush If the guy made you feel too relaxed instead of excited then this would mean that youre comfortable around him but probably dont see him as crush material   If you cant stay still when youre around him then you may have a crush If your hands shake or you cant stop talking or you just keep gesturing when you speak then your energy level is higher than usual because you have a crush If youre so excited that you laugh at everything he says even if its not that funny you probably have a crush If you like the guy youre more likely to think that every word that comes out of his mouth is hilarious If youre so excited that you cant sleep at night because you keep thinking of the guy or replaying your conversation in your head then you have a crush If you feel a jolt of excitement and your heart races when he greets you texts or chats you or even just when he says your name then you have a crush   If you have a crush on the guy then you wont feel completely comfortable around him Instead you would feel nervous because youre worried about what he thinks about you and dont want to say the wrong thing If youre nervous it means you care what he thinks about you and if you care what he thinks about you then  you guessed it  you have a crush   If your hands tremble your knees shake or your voice wavers when youre around him then hes making you nervous If youre so nervous that you keep rambling when you talk to him or just completely clam up because you cant think of anything to say then you have a crush If youre so nervous that you bump into things around him walk into tables or drop all of the contents of your purse in front of him then you have a crush If youre so nervous that you always feel embarrassed or constantly blush when youre around the guy even though theres no reason for it then you have a crush   If you have a crush then its natural for you to not want the guy you like to be dating talking about or maybe even hanging out with other girls If youre cool with him having a girlfriend or flirting with a lot of girls then you probably dont have a crush on him   If the thought of the guy dating other girls makes you cringe you probably have a crush If the thought of the guy just hanging out with other girls makes you feel squeamish then you definitely have a crush Just try not to make this a problem in the future or you may be facing some jealousy issues If he has a girlfriend and you think he has a great relationship and are happy for him without any complications then you probably dont have a crush
Individuals who are friends before a relationship are more likely to remain friends after a breakupYou will be less likely to remain friends if you completely withdraw from the person after the breakupHowever you may need this time to get space and be alone   Though you may wish to stay friends you may have an easier time getting over your ex if you donât see and talk to him   For now it can be helpful to remove him from your Facebook friend list delete his number from your phone and avoid hanging out with him If your ex wants to stay friends let him know that youâre going to need time and that youâll contact him when youâre ready   It may be easier to get space to grieve if you are not reminded of your ex by everything around you Letting go of the physical and digital may help you let go emotionally tooFor example if he left a toothbrush at your place throw it out Seeing it every morning could trigger negative feelings for you and color your day If there is something that shouldnât be thrown away or given to charity give it to a mutual friend to give back Delete or toss away the photos if you wish If you want you can save the photos of yourself using Photoshop or some other editing program to carve out your image without your partnerDelete your exs number from your phone If you need his number delete every message or voicemail from himââa clean slate   It only hurts you to turn the breakup into an ongoing fight   If it is too painful to address your ex at this point try to exit the situation so that you can avoid talking to him Setting boundaries is an important component of the healing process If you donât want to talk to him you donât have to If you do decide to speak to him acknowledge him politely and smile Be respectful Aggressive speech such as saying âI hate youâ or behaviors such as throwing objects at your ex do not solve problems   Just because the relationship has ended doesnât mean you have to erase it from your life It is likely that the person you had a relationship with had a big impact on you and your life and you can cherish those changes This is especially helpful if you have a lot of anger and resentment toward your ex Focusing on the positive may be able to assist you in positively coping and gaining closure from the relationship   Forgive your ex for his mistakes Harboring resentment only makes you feel worse and stunts the healing process You donât have to tell him facetoface or even on the phone you can forgive him in your heart and this is just as effective Avoid ruminating over the happy times This can lead to longing and prolong your grief process
Another benefit of talking to your friends about your crush is that they can get information for you Or you can find out for yourself Does your crush look nervous around you Does their face become flush or do they look away sometimes Those may be good signs   If a girl plays with her necklace flicks her hair or rolls up her sleeves she might like you If a guy breathes in and pulls his shoulders back or stands like a cowboy with his hands on his hips and thumbs hooked through his belt loop  he might like you  Think of creative ways to approach your crush about going on a date with you Search on the Internet for unique ways or ask friends about how they got their boyfriends or girlfriends to go out with them And if they say yes plan a memorable date thats fun for both of you A few things to remember   Dont ramble Keep it simple Make it an offer worth their time Surprise them with something out of the ordinary Dont underestimate the power of just being confident Make good eye contact and smile at them Half of the fun of getting a guy or girl is the challenge before the catch Enjoy the feeling of liking someone before getting wrapped up in what will happen next Middle school is a special time for this special feeling
Keeping a horse in a field seems simple but a good field needs regular care to provide enough grass to eat Each horse or pony needs at least 12 a hectare  one acre to graze or more if possible The grass should be healthy and free of poisonous plants such as ragwort or yew  A clean water supply is vital as horses drink about 36 litres 8 gallons a day Ideally there should be a trough which refills from the mains water supply automatically If this isnt possible fill the trough each day with buckets of clean water If it becomes cloudy the trough needs draining with a scrubbing brush which is clean but with NO DETERGENT   Horses need shelter to escape from flies the sun and bad weather A high dense hedge is enough for some ponies but ideally they should have a threesided shed The open side has easy access to in and out of the shed and prevents one horse from getting trapped in the corner by the others   Dividing the field If horses live in one field for a long time the field may become horse sick This is where some areas are over grazed and the grass become sparse but around the horses droppings it becomes lush and infested with worms To prevent this fence the field off into 2 sections and graze one section at a time The other left section has been allowed a rest from grazing for a time to grow back more grass   When a horse lives out for most of the year and no one is riding him he doesnt need any extra food in the summer months and only needs hay in the winter If a horse is being ridden regularly he needs other food such as horse cubes or nuts grains or sugar beet to keep his energy levels up The amount he needs depends on how big he is and how much work he is doing Chaff is chopped up hay It is a good addition to a horses winter diet Pony cubes are an excellent all round source of energy for a working horse   Being herd animals Horses get lonely if they are kept in a big space on their own If possible a horse should be kept with at least one other horse for company Even another animal such as a sheep will be better than nothing

Does he try to find common interests with you For example he may ask questions about what music you like or what TV you watch or he might make comments like âOh I love pineapple pizza tooâ when youâre chatting If so he may be trying to express that heâs interested in you Does he ask what youâre interested in Has he asked you if you have a boyfriend He may also ask your friends questions about you so checking in with them may help you decide whether heâs into you   For example if you say something about how another guy not him is hot or goodlooking and he speaks up he may be showing you that heâs a little jealous   If he offers you a ride home or brings you coffee or a snack without you asking he may be expressing his interest in you   Pay attention though if he also offers favors to everyone else he may just be a friendly guy

Spending time together allows you both to get to know each other on a deeper level Eliminate distractions including cell phones unwanted visitors or blaring music whenever you can Getting to know her and spending time together are essential to building a romantic relationshipYou wonât know what activities you enjoy together unless you communicate Choose activities that you can both do together like studying hiking or grabbing a bite to eat Make sure you make it clear that you enjoy your time with her and appreciate how much you both are getting to know one another  If you fear rejection putting your emotions out in the open can be terrifying however you should also realize that regret can be just as powerful Realize that putting yourself out there and knowing the truth is the only way to overcome both the fear of rejection and regret It is a relief just to get this off your chest   Do you actually love her or is this lust or infatuation Could you stand losing her friendship Do not be friends with her in hopes that you can change her mind about you This is unfair to her as friendships should be based on trust and respect If you truly love her you will be a good friend first and foremost   Analyzing your own feelings can be difficult but there are a few scientifically proven signals that may indicate whether youâre in love Do you exhibit any of these feelingsIf you believe that she is unique it may be because your brain has elevated levels of focus and attention If you think that she is perfect and only focus on her positive qualities it may be because your memory has increased to accommodate your new feelings of love If you feel like youâre a wreck over your new love it is because research has shown that being in love involves similar brain activity to being addicted with similar mood swings Going through adversity can also make you fall in love because your brain produces more dopamine a chemical responsible for reward and pleasure If you feel you are obsessing over her it may be because your brain has decreased the levels of central serotonin which is associated with obsessive behavior People in love have also shown signs of emotional dependency in which they want to be together all the time and hope to stay together forever When youâre in love you may feel like youâll do anything for her because you have a greater sense of empathy for the woman you love Studies have shown that being in love is about an emotional union not about sex Studies have also shown that people in love feel that their love is uncontrollable     Be direct when expressing yourself Donât assume that you know how she is feeling Always respectfully ask and thank her for opening up to you Being open is essential in expressing your love for one another Love is a very strong emotion and is usually developed over time Take a look at how your relationship with her has developed over time and focus on all the positive emotions you have shared together If you feel that your love for her has developed rather quickly stay positive that there is no better time to reveal your feelings You can always find a reason not to do something so be bold and follow your heart   Donât be distracted by outside factors Approach her when you are going to be able to talk to her in relative privacy and when neither of you will feel rushed Look for a quiet place or ask to schedule a meeting to ensure that both of you are mentally and emotionally present Expressing your love should be a joyous occasion so make sure youâve created a situation where she is able to fully process her thoughts and emotionsYou donât want to tell her you love her when you are being distracted by friends or she has to work overtime to meet the deadline of an important client   Chat with her whenever you have the opportunity and initiate with a smile Focus on your posture and maintain eye contact Be friendly and joke when you can but dont be rude Dont overwhelm her as a smile and a wave can go along way   Engage her in a conversation by starting with a simple Hows are you You will come off as creepy or awkward if you stand at her location without saying anything If you cant think of something to say because youre nervous just say hello and keep walking or talk to someone else   Her friends are her support system and will protect her so leave a good impression and take a genuine interest in who they are Endearing yourself to her friends will let them and her know that you are fully invested in her wellbeing   Studies have shown that men are prone to saying âI love youâ first because they do not want to lose a relationship whereas women want to ensure that the relationship is worth their investment so they are inclined to waitSo before you say âI love youâ prove that you are worth it and leave no doubt in her mind why she loves you back   There are many resources that give examples of romantic gestures however love is a personal thing Only you know how to express your love and what will make her happy Whether itâs buying her flowers after sheâs had a long day singing her favorite song to surprise her or just holding hands everyday as you walk her home from school showing her that you love her isnât just a one time gesture but rather a state of mind that informs all that you do   The best way tell her you love her is to be direct There is no sense in trying to manipulate her or trying to wait her out Give her time to process her thoughts and emotions She may say that she wants to just stay friends so be prepared to examine your own emotions and what role she will play in your life moving forward Some people may have a very difficult time hearing or using that word However you articulate your emotions be sure that she completely understands your intentions   For example if you know she gets awkward and skittish whenever you watch the end of romantic comedies whenever the characters finally say âI love youâ do not make the same gesture Instead sincerely but casually let her know how much you care about her and that you want to take a step forward in your relationship   Religion cultural differences or strict family members can all be involved in how she responds to you Remember to always be respectful of who she is because if you truly love her you will get to know these things about her and how you can possibly work through any obstacle   If she is tentative but still says yes address it and abide by the rules she has set in order to ease her mind If she asked you to get to know her parents first because of her cultural customs then take it as an honour and follow her lead If she does not want to get physical in the relationship then donât pressure her   Whether she says she loves you or rejects you express yourself tactfully especially if youâre in public Dont be a jerk and try to lash out if your feelings hurt   If she doesnt love you back remember that she is still the same person who you have created a deep bond with so continue to respect her You cannot force someone to like or love you   Donât become unresponsive or stonewall her Women are sensitive to interpersonal cues so blank expressions or being stonewalled can escalate an already negative situation If you have gotten to know one another and developed a strong relationship based on respect and open communication chances are that she will express the same feelings of love Take pride in being able to put your emotions out into the open and celebrate with her Even if the love she shares stops at friendship revel in your personal growth Share your experience with others and know that you are not aloneUse your friends family and other parts of your support system to deal with rejection   If you really love someone you will respect them care for them and be there for the good and the bad Love can be a roller coaster but the scariest part is taking the first plunge and telling her that you love her   Get closure If she doesnât have the same feelings for you do not keep persisting Learn to accept that it wasnât meant to be and keep optimistic that there is something meant for you just around the corner This may be difficult but take as much time as you need Thatâs why there are so many sad love songs and movies that can help cheer you up There is no sense in trying to manipulate her or trying to wait her out If you tell her you love her and says she doesnât feel the same but wants to stay friends respectfully declineYour emotions may be too raw after you have been rejected to maintain a friendship A friendship is based on mutual support and respect Ask yourself if you can truly give that to her after you have clearly expressed that you see her as more than a friend Can you still be friends with her if she is dating someone else
If they are not single and are currently in a relationship its almost always not the best idea to pursue this person unless you are certain they are unhappy in their relationship Otherwise its best to just either move on or wait it out until they split up  If you have spoken before move on to the next step   Its important that the person you are crushing on is introduced to you before you start to get any idea of a romantic connection     A strong relationship has to be built on a foundation of trust knowledge and affection you have built for them over the time you have got to know them Far too many teenagers nowadays jump into relationships that last a week because they barely know their boyfriendgirlfriend If you want this to work its worth spending a little bit of time getting to know this person     When you are around this person give them all of your attention dont text but say you are listening dont file your nails but say you find them interesting it will send mixed messages and any romantic relationship may not be possible if they think you arent interested in what they have to say     Say hi in the corridors smile at them from across the classroom make them feel like you think they are important Everyone likes to feel like someone wants to communicate with them     When you are engaging in conversation lean in and touch their arm Just that little signal may leave them wondering what you feel Another important thing is when you are talking to them and the conversation is just getting good it may be a good time to stop talking Many people make a habit of continuing talking to someone until the conversation gets boring Wouldnt you rather the last thing your crush remembers of your talk is something fun and cool instead of an awkward silence Leave himher wanting more     Its always good to get to know your crushes friends guysgirls find it a huge relief when their crush gets along with their friends Dont make too good friends though you dont want your crush to think you like hisher friends heshe will totally go off of you     If you know he loves something read up on it or surf the internet to get a better knowledge of it then bring it up in conversation people love when others make an effort for them     This is the biggest turn onÂ thereÂ is Everyone likes to be around someone who is natural and down to earth Nobody likes a fake uptight person

You are about to take a big risk However close you may be and however compatible you are as platonic friends going from friend to boyfriend or girlfriend is a huge change in any relationship â so huge that it will be changed forever You should therefore carefully consider whether the risk is worth it Can you get over a rejection Are you willing to risk harming your friendship even ending it for the chance at love You and your friend might not want that   Try to find out if the feeling is mutual Does your friend seem to drop verbal or physical hints that she sees you as a potential partner Does she flirt with you Or does she treat you as a sibling or talk about her attraction to others If the latter then she may be signalling that she isnt interested in you   You may be perfectly compatible as friends You may get along famously spending hours together oneonone or in larger groups of friends laughing together and sharing all of your thoughts But this does not guarantee you will be compatible as lovers Do you share the same values Beliefs Passions Will you have good chemistry If you cannot determine this can you honestly imagine that the two of you would work as a couple   Are you sure that your feelings are more than just lust or passing fancy Sometimes major life events push people together and cloud our judgement Are you on the rebound Are you lonely Are you both dealing with personal loss like a death in the family If the catalyst is one of these you may want to wait and see how you feel in one or two months Make certain that your interest is motivated by legitimate desire longing or love   It may be that she doesnt see you as anything more than a friend You have to be prepared for that possibility You also have to understand that your relationship wont be quite the same once youve come clean with your feelings It may be awkward or it may end entirely If you have decided to risk your friendship you have to be able to accept the consequences   One way to begin your move is to signal that you are indeed interested Your friend may not realize it and she may share your feelings and have no idea that you feel the same way Talk openly about your dating life Perhaps even ask your friend about hers You will have to change the way that she sees you and to show her that you are looking for a relationship   If you have known each other for a while you should already have some idea of what your friend likes dislikes does for fun and looks for in others Deepen your interest in her Ask her about her activities Does she like tennis Didnt she know that you do too Perhaps you could play a match together sometime Focus on activities that you share with an eye to demonstrating your compatibility   Scientific studies show that flirting â signalling interest and availability â often trumps physical attractivenessStart slowly Smile make eye contact joke perhaps even lightly touch your friend on the arm But dont come out too strong or too physically After all your aim is to signal your interest and at the same time put your friend at ease   Even if you are flirting always keep your friends level of comfort in mind The worst possible thing you can do is to put her off by coming on too strongly Laughter is usually a good social lubricant make her laugh and show by your behavior and demeanor that you are a fun person and that you enjoy her company Try to be your old lighthearted self  the one that she knows so well  and not let the pressures of the situation make you too serious   After you have weighed the decision signaled your interest and tested the waters it is at last time to take the leap ask your friend out Keep in mind that you will have to be upfront about what you are asking so that there is no ambiguity This is a date not just a friendly gettogether The best way is to ask her in person This will let you see her body language and reaction and help you to modify your behavior in turn You may be more comfortable asking over the phone by message or through a third person and these are all valid options But keep in mind that face to face contact however scary is more personal and friendly   Your friend said yes What took you so long to ask In arranging the first date it is important to keep the situation low key Youve never been together in this way before and both of you may feel stressed Go for a walk together play a tennis match go for coffee It does not need to be a major event or even last long The key thing is to see each other in a new dynamic   If the first date was a success start to see each other more regularly You will both need time to make a mental and physical transition from âfriendsâ to âcoupleâ Dont press the issue On the other hand make an effort to treat your new beau as a beau not just your friend Start to plan proper dates and make it clear that the relationship has changed   There is no need to rush this You may already be used to greeting each other with a hug Start there After one or two dates try holding her hand Be as confident and relaxed as possible finding new but still comfortable ways to add touch to the relationship In time and with chemistry you can start thinking about the first kiss and cuddling   You and your beau should be clear with each other about your expectations If one of you wants a serious relationship and the other does not things will probably not work out Let your friends in on your changed status as well especially if they are mutual friends Keeping them in the dark may make it seem as though you hiding something or make for added complications   Your friend may say no She may feel that the first date didnt work or that you didnt share enough chemistry Or you may date for a time before deciding that you were both better off as friends Whatever the case you will have to come to terms with this outcome and move on in time With luck you and your friend can still be on good terms or even friends as in the past   A failed romance does not necessarily doom a friendship But it can be problematic If you decide to stay friends try to stay lighthearted about your failed efforts  a bit of humor can go along way That said set clear emotional and physical boundaries no kissing no flirting no hankypanky If you need time to mourn put some distance between yourselves Date other people as well Dont maintain the friendship in the sheer hope that shell somehow come around again and date you again While the worst case scenario is having to cut off all contact at the very least you will have closure and know that you gave it a valiant effort
It can be hard to catch a girlâs attention if she thinks you have other commitments Donât spend a lot of time hanging out with other girls in a oneonone setting Consider mentioning that youâre single around her but donât force it into conversation or say it in a way that is selfpitying Mention how you wish you had something fun to do on a night youâre free  Your friend isnât going to make the move while youâre out with your friends getting fast food Figure out something that the two of you can do together alone Donât do something dramatic like taking her to a fancy restaurant Something as simple as going to the park together is fine   Let her know that you are interested Flirt with her a little bit If you arenât sure how to do this just smiling and laughing a lot while you have a conversation is a good place to start Donât do it too much or it will seem forced but doing it more than usual will let her know you are really enjoying talking to her   Playing hard to get isnât going to work Be open and honest with her Give your honest opinion if she asks you what you think about something You donât have to wear your heart on your sleeve but you should be willing to talk about your feelings to a certain extent   If sheâs flirting with you flirt back Gently tease her Mirror her body language the best you can to make her comfortableSheâs never going to make a move if she doesnât think you want her to   Ultimately thereâs nothing that you can do that will force the girl to make the first move You can only hope that she likes you and try to set up the right situation If it seems like things are going well relax and go with the flow There will be a moment when itâs clear sheâs going to make a move where she slides close to you or makes eye contact for a long time while smiling   If youâre already friends it could change the dynamic of your relationship forever even to the point that you no longer talk to one another If you arenât willing to take this risk then it is best to move on and not pursue this relationship   It can be difficult to have feelings for someone and not show them but they will eventually subside If you canât pursue the relationship and are having trouble getting over her try a new activity or go someplace youâve never been before It will help distract you from your friend and you may even meet someone new you like while youâre out   People say that you should be yourself when it comes to dating This is true but you should strive to be the best version of yourself you can be Make sure you practice good hygiene and wear clothes that fit well Keep your hair wellmaintained Start exercising if you donât already as muscularity is something that almost everyone sees as attractive  Just because she is single doesnât mean she is interested in dating or interested in dating you People are attracted to others for different reasons and many times the feeling is not mutual Keep this in mind at all times so you donât disrespect her and do something immoral or unkind   Donât get upset if sheâs interested in someone else You probably could not have done anything to stop or change this Thereâs plenty of fish in the sea and youâll find someone that makes you happy soon enough Above all donât try to split them up   You shouldnât stop being a good friend because you have a romantic interest in them In fact being a good friend will help your case more than changing your how you interact with them would It should be an authentic friendship that you maintain because you like them not just because you want to hook up with them   If youâre serious about this you should also try to become friends with her group of friends Remember that these should be authentic friendships People will quickly notice if you are just pretending to like them to get in their good graces You donât have to be best friends but you should at least try to be friendly   If you have already been friends with this person for a while they may not know that you are romantically interested in them Try flirting a little bit by doing things like playfully teasing them while smiling and making eye contact Lowpressure physical contact like shoulder taps and touching their forearm is also appropriate but remember to not take it too far These things will let the person know you want to be more than just friends If sheâs interested in you sheâll do things to let you know it She may start obviously flirting with you but she may be a little subtler about it as well Look for signs like her smiling and tilting her head slightly upwards or her offering to share food off her plate with you These are all signals that she is attracted to you Look for signs that she is not interested as well If you see these itâs time to stop otherwise you are harassing your friend She may not come out and say outright that she is not interested but she may say something like âIâm really happy with our friendshipâ or turn away when you try flirting with her If you suspect things arenât going well youâre probably right
One way to let your crush see that you like him without opening your mouth is to simply lock eyes with him Make eye contact for just one or two secondsâjust enough time to show youâre paying attentionâand then look down at the floor or just avert your gaze This will show your crush that you like him without being too obvious if you simply stare at him that may be coming on too strong   You can try this trick just one or two times when youâre in the same room together whether youâre at a party or in class Just try to be subtle about it you donât want him to catch you staring too many times You can even give him a small flirtatious smile to go along with the look  You donât need to give your crush an eartoear grin to show him that youâre interested Simply look at him give him a small smile and then look away or start a conversation with him Your smile shouldnât be too big or eager or he may just think youâre being friendly instead try to be a little bit mysterious when you smile at him so you play coy while letting him know youâre interested   If you really want to up your flirtation factor you can even learn to smile with your eyes    Another way to let your crush know you like him is through some simple open body language If your body is âopenâ that means that youâre standing tall face your crush turn your feet and shoulders toward him and keep your arms out instead of crossed over your chest This shows your crush that youâre interested in him and that you like being around him The next time youâre standing next to him or sitting next to him make sure youâre turning your body in his direction so he sees that you like him   For example if youâre talking to him and cross your legs make sure your crossed leg is crossed toward him not away so you have more of an open posture   Another way to show your crush that you like him is to simply move a bit closer to him whether youâre talking to him or just hanging out at the same party You donât need to be too forward or start closetalking or making him uncomfortable but you should show him that you like him by simply gravitating toward him in social situations Without being clingy you can show your crush that you like him simply by paying a bit more attention than you do to other guys by standing next to him sitting by him or making sure you get a chance to chat when youâre in a small group   When you do talk to him you can make an effort to stand a bit closer or to sit a bit closer to him as the conversation progresses If he doesnât move away but moves toward you then this may be a sign that he returns your feelings   If you want to tell your crush you like him without blurting it out completely one thing you can do is to give him a light touch or two If youâre talking to him or pass by him you can give him a light touch on the shoulder or upper arm or even playfully swat his arm if heâs teasing you If youâre standing or sitting next to him you can casually let your feet or knees touch from time to time to show him that you want to get closer   Just a bit of physical attention will let your crush know that you like him You donât need to push it too far just touching him once or twice during a conversation will show him that you like him   Now this doesnât mean that you have to dress to the nines or put on a ton of makeup to get your crushâs attention However it does mean that you should look and feel beautiful fresh and clean when you talk to your crush putting an effort into your appearance will give you a boost of confidence and it will also show your crush that you want to make a good impression on him Make sure to wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and not to pretend to be someone youâre not   If youâre hanging out with your crush and just a small group of people dressing up will show him that youâve put some thought into how you look for him which may indicate that you do have a crush on him   One way to show the guy you like him is to try to be his friend As long as you donât get into the friend zone this will show that youâre taking a real interest in him Ask him questions about his life share his interests and just spend some time around him whether youâre working on a group project or hanging out with friends Just make sure he doesnât see you as a kid sister or one of the guys and donât fall into the role of the person who hears about his romantic troubles   Becoming his friend will show him that you want to get closer to him This can be a great way to show him you like him especially if you donât have many other guy friends Take it slow If you donât know him very well start with a simple conversation and work your way up to hanging out   If you want to tell your crush you like him then you should show him that youâre comfortable being yourself around him If you find yourself bragging talking about how great you are telling exaggerated stories for laughs or just doing something that doesnât feel like you then this wonât win your crush over Heâll be more likely to think you have a real interest in him if youâre being yourself opening up and talking about your interests or your friends   Remember that in the end you want a guy who likes you for who you are You donât want him to like you for being someone else because that will make it hard to start a real relationship while staying true to who you are   A small gift can be a simple way to show your crush that you like him without coming on too strong Simply get him something heâs mentioned or something you think he would like such as a book or a CD You can also be silly and get him something more practical like a pack of pencils because you noticed that he never remembers to bring a pencil to class You can write him a short note along with the gift and give it to him in person or leave it on his desk   Of course this works best if you know him and are already friends if youâve never met then giving him a gift may overwhelm him a little   One way to tell your crush you like him is to show a genuine interest in him To do this you should simply ask him questions about his life and make an effort to really listen to the answers instead of planning your next move Ask him about his weekend plans his favorite sports teams his school activities his friends or his favorite bands or movie stars to get a conversation going this will show that you care about him as a person and that you may have a little crush on him as well   You can also ask him about his pets his favorite movies or his favorite things to do for fun Just make sure not to ask too many personal questions at first or he may get uncomfortable Make sure to share stuff about yourself too you donât want to sound like youâre interrogating him   Your crush will start to see that you like him if you start teasing him a bit You donât need to lay it on too thick to get the message across just playfully tease him about his new haircut his favorite sports team especially if the team keeps losing his obsession with his favorite band or other things you know he wonât take too personally This shows that you like him enough to engage him in a fun lighthearted conversation   Just make sure he knows youâre teasing and that he takes it well He may be too sensitive about his favorite sports team for example to think thereâs anything funny about the fact that they keep losing Let him see that you donât tease just anybody If he thinks that you tease all of his friends too then he wonât see that heâs special to you   Your crush will suspect that you like him if you start helping him out You donât need to go too far out of your way to help him but making just a few small gestures can show him that you really do have a special interest in him This can mean picking up his homework for him when heâs home sick letting him borrow a textbook or answering some questions that he may have This can be a great way to show him you care as long as he doesnât take advantage of you   Ideally he should find a way to help you out too You donât want him to think that youâll just be there at his beck and call Look for ways that you can help him he may be too shy to do something like ask for him with the math homework but you can offer to do it and see what he says   Flirting will definitely let your crush know that youâre into him To flirt with him you just have to tease him a bit be playful and show a special interest in him over all of the other guys in the room You can play a little bit hard to get while letting him see that you do like him by smiling at him laughing at his jokes and going out of your way to make him see that you want to spend more time with him   Flirting can be a little tricky to master but it basically means not taking yourself too seriously while you chat about lighthearted topics with your crush letting him see that you want to know what he has to say while also teasing him a little bit You can lick your lips or play with your hair a bit while you talk to your crush to be a bit more playful   If you do want your crush to know how much you like him you should make sure to tell him yourself even if you do it in a letter While having your friends tell your crush how you feel may be easier it will make you look like youâre not ready for a mature relationship or like you donât feel comfortable talking to him yourself Even if he does say that he likes you back this wonât start your relationship off on the right foot   Plus you donât want him to feel annoyed by all of your friends surrounding him respect his privacy and tell him about your feelings yourself   If youâre too afraid to tell your crush you like him in person then one thing you can do is to write him a short note or a longer letter letting him know how you feel You can slide it into his locker or hand it to him Tell him that you like him give him a reason or two why if you want and ask if he returns your feelings This is a great way to directly tell him how you feel while taking off some of the pressure of having to do it in person   Keep it short and sweet You donât want to go into too much detail about how you like him without knowing whether or not he returns your feelings You can tell him the best way to contact you either by telling him where he can leave his response or by giving him your number   Another way to tell him that you like him is to give him a call and simply to tell him how you feel Yeah this technically means telling him how you feel with words but if you find that telling him without words hasnât been working for you then it may be time to come out with it Give him a call take a deep breath and quickly tell him how you feel and ask him if he returns your feelings Youâll have your answer before you know it   Just say something like âIâve had a lot of fun hanging out with you for the past few weeks and I want you to know that I like you I wanted to know if you shared my feelingsâ   If the idea of calling him to tell him your feelings doesnât feel quite right then you may just have to pick the right time and place to have the conversation in person Just ask him if he can meet you in a place where you can be alone make eye contact and simply tell him how you feel Give him some time to react and respond and try not to put the pressure on him keep things lighthearted instead of sounding intense   You can make a bit of small talk to make him comfortable but donât be afraid to jump in and share your feelings You can give him a small compliment or two while you say that you like him You can say something like âNobody can make me laugh like you canâ to show why you like him   Once your crush knows you like him heâll either say he shares your feelings or will want to stay friends If he says he likes you too then you can celebrate and get excited to start a relationship with him If he doesnât feel the same way however itâs important to stay mature and to keep things positive instead of getting emotional or making him feel bad for not feeling the same way Though you will be upset you should make it seem like itâs not a big deal and then be sad about it once youâre away from your crush   No matter what happens you want to leave a good impression If you start calling him names or being mean to him for not sharing your feelings that will take you down a dark path Even if he doesnât share your feelings heâll respect you for being open and honest with him You should be proud of yourself for putting yourself out there and making an effort
Girls love it when boys have confidence To act confident you have to believe in yourself However do not be cocky   Girls almost always fall for romantic guys   Girls love funny guys But dont say disgusting things that you think are funny as that will only gross her out   For instance tell her that you are willing to help her with her homework If she asks you to help her with homework rather than going to your friends party   Dress in cool clothes and wear some nice cologne or something but dont go overboard   If she looks back at you then the answer might be positive But dont just keep staring at each other for an hour with nothing else to do  If someone speaks poorly of her even if not seriously do not tolerate this   Most girls like flirty guys But dont overdo it You can flirt with her by smiling a lot tickling her softly though some girls may not like to be tickled complimenting her telling her it was fun being with her or winking at her many girls think its really sexy when a boy winks at them so give it a try You can also flirt in your own ways as long as you dont do something that she doesnt like Groping inappropriately will make a very bad impression   If the two of you have been hanging out for a week or so and you feel like she might be into you dont be afraid to ask her out Have faith in yourself and think of how much its worth it to ask because if she agrees you will have plenty of fun   Take a walk with her at sunset on the beach That would be the perfect place to try to kiss her   Most girls prefer a private romantic kiss This doesnt mean you take her to your room in your bed Take her to a quiet romantic looking place and shell most probably get the message that you want a kiss But if she doesnt want to come to a private place with you that either means that shes not ready to kiss you its her first time she feels uncomfortable with you or shes just nervous or shy Dont force it when shes ready you will know   Dont hurt her feelings though tease her in a joking and funny manner and make sure that she knows that youre just joking Never tease her by making fun of her   If she tries to come closer to you it can signal that shes into you If she just smiles andor blushes it may mean that she likes you but shes shy   Nothing is worse than telling a girl shes beautiful when she knows its not true Try complimenting her on specific things like how pretty her hair is or how soft her hand feels in yours   If she tries to come closer to you holds your hand and squeezes it gently smiles a lot looks at you most of the time snuggles to you hugs you pecks your cheek then it means that she likes you and shes happy to be with you and she was really looking forward to going out with you If she doesnt pay much attention to you you could make her jealous by flirting with another girl in front of her Be cautious with this
Acting cold and distant may seem cool but its a turnoff to other people If you dont act open and available enough not even girlsguys that do like you will have the courage to talk to you   The first step in getting a boyfriendgirlfriend is expressing interest in that person Dont be afraid that you will be turned down comfort yourself thinking that youve at least tried In time becoming better at flirting will improve your chances of getting someone to like you   When you like somebody hint it to them or tell them directly The more love you give the more you receive Touch them softly play with their hair these are little gestures that express affection and make you feel closer to others Help them out when they need help and be understanding when they talk about their problems To sum it up show them that you care about them   Confidence is the key its what makes the difference between the hot and the not A person can seem absolutely awesome even when theyre not like that in reality due to their confidence Confidence is the way to make people acknowledge what a wonderful person you are If you dont see your own qualities how would you expect others to see them Find something that you like about yourself and point them out to boysgirls Enhance your best features not only in your look but also in your personality   It doesnt necessarily mean that you have to be popular in order to be liked by the opposite gender although it would help but having a bad reputation decreases your chances to get a significant other If you have a reputation as promiscuousa player weirdo nerd gossiper mean girlguy etc people would be less likely to talk to you because of the prejudices they have about you   It often happens that the person you like doesnt make the first move you have two options either to wait until the other one initiates a flirt which may never happen or to do something yourself This doesnt apply only to boys although the tradition is that the boy should make the first move but theres nothing wrong if a girl does either On the contrary its even recommended the guy will admire your courage   If you fixate on how scared you are youll psyche yourself out Everything you do do it with confidence When talking to somebody you like stay cool and try not to blush or act nervous Theres nothing to be afraid of theyre probably just as nervous as you are   Its unfair but the first impression you leave to someone will most likely persist in their memory for a long time and be the heaviest factor in influencing that persons opinion on you even if its a wrong impression   This applies to girls and boys not only girls are the ones who are supposed to look good for the opposite sex   Having a high standard of personal hygiene is the very least you can do to improve your appearance Dont smell take showers and use deodorant and maybe fragrance if you want to Have nice clean hair and clean teeth make sure your mouth doesnt smell either Clean and cut your nails dont let them grow too long especially if youre a boy Wear clean ironed clothes  Be welldressed The clothes must not necessarily be very expensive but they always must be clean fit for your size and appropriate for your body type Very important dress tastefully Okay maybe youre not an expert at choosing the right clothes for you and combining them but at least ask for advice from somebody who is one Its crucial not to look like your blind grandmother picks your clothes   Smiling makes you look cuter more charming and more lovable A genuine smile can lighten up someones day Its the best way to express interest in somebody in a way in which you have no chances of making a fool of yourself   Being annoying may seem fun to you but its certainly not fun for those you annoy A little teasing or playing every now and then is acceptable even welcome in some cases but being annoying on a regular basis is the perfect way to repel boysgirls   Being mean with other people for no reason or treating them like dirt will make you hit the Most Hated list Nobody likes unfriendly obnoxious people   Really there will be many people who will like you for you not just your looks Plus if youre being crushed on because youre on the footballcheerleading team but no one knows your passion for singingkarate whats the point
The most important way you can attract the guy of your dreams is to be confident and content in your own self You can do this by wearing a cute outfit doing something new with your hair trying a new makeup style or simply just thinking positively because confidence is one of the most attractive traits a person can possibly have and it will make you less anxious about failure which makes it hard to take the leap and into a potential relationship   Dont judge yourself or others harshly When you focus on all your flaws that is all that youll think you have to offer and when you focus on the flaws of others you are making your own brain toxic with negative thoughts Dont compare yourself to other people Someone is always going to be more attractive than you more successful than you and have more romantic partners than you Focus on the things that you have rather than the things that other people have  If you want people to notice you especially that guy of your dreams you should send a little smile in his direction and cultivate a positive attitude Even better make eye contact with your chosen sweetheart and give him a little smile Itll signal your interest in a nonthreatening way and perhaps intrigue him Now this doesnt mean that you should go around stalking him wherever he goes but if you know that he likes to frequent a particular coffee shop or book store feel free to spend some time there and bump into him   Itll give you a little chance to talk to one another without a bunch of people around like at a party Dont do this all the time or hell think that youre stalking him Once or twice is the ticket before it becomes obvious what youre up to There is nothing wrong with straightforwardly asking him out but if youre not feeling bold enough this is a good way to work up the nerve to winning him over   You dont want to be super overt and clingy about trying to win your guys heart because you wont come off very well However this doesnt mean that you need to hide your interest or pretend not to be interested You simply want to make it so that you are interested but not overwhelming   You could try dropping a compliment or two something that isnt overwhelming overwhelming would be youre the most gorgeous guy Ive ever met like hey that shirt is really awesome or I really like your new haircut Show that you have a life outside of thinking about him When the two of you do talk just casually mention some of the fun things youve done that week even if its things like the awesome book you read or video game tournament you participated in or the soccer game you won It shows that you have interests and a life of your own When you run into him after chatting for a bit say that you have to run to meet a friend or that you have to be somewhere That way youll come across as having things to do and people to see rather than someone who is waiting around to bump into him   Oftentimes the key to a persons heart is through their humor The saying goes the couple that laughs together stays together If you get him laughing at things youre saying youll make him enjoy your company more and want to be around you more often   A good way to do this is to mention something that is slightly embarrassing or humbling that happened to you Mention the time you mistook a stranger for your best friend and slapped them on the butt or how on the way to the date you missed a step on the bus and fell out the door in front of everyone It shows that you dont take yourself too seriously and that you can laugh at yourself You dont need to belittle yourself or talk about how stupid you are A confident person doesnt need to belittle themselves because they know that they are awesome And confidence is attractive   He will listen to his friends advice about whether or not to date you so youll want to make sure that youre number one their list This doesnt mean that you need to agree with everything they say or that you should let them walk all over you if his friends are that bad though you should rethink the guy youre wanting to attract but it does mean that youre nice to them   When youre out with him and his friends really listen to what they say and show that you have interest in their interests You dont have to pretend to be an expert in what theyre talking about if youre not Simply ask some questions and listen Dont feel like you should sit on the sidelines when youre around him and his friends Participate in activities and introduce them to things that you like and you think they might like Itll show that you have respect for them and that youre interested in getting to know them better   This rule allows you to avoid committing yourself to a courtship that is basically going nowhere because who has the energy for that It means that if youve given him opportunities to try to get to know you better and he hasnt jumped at the chance after 3 tries then hes probably not worth further effort   If you think that maybe he is interested but simply shy there is no reason that you shouldnt ask him out instead That way even if he does say no you will have a firm answer and wont be left wondering The reason this is a good rule to follow is that you dont really want to be after him like a lovesick desperate puppy If he hasnt shown interest after awhile hes not going to or hes only going to show interest in having sex with you because he knows that youre desperate stay as far away from guys like that as you possibly can Unless youre only interested in sex youll end up hurt by this arrangement An example of this in action might be you meeting him at a party and chatting with him then popping in by his favorite coffee shop and running into him there and then chatting with him in class later If youve given him openings to ask you on a date or even for coffee and he hasnt gone for it after those 3 times stop trying and move on   Now that youve gotten past the flirting stage youll need to have that first date A good way to win his heart is to have a successful first date that you both enjoy Itll will make him want to spend more time with you   Make sure that you have topics to talk about because it can be awkward during a first date not to blurt out something that is more appropriate for a closer relationship probably not a good time to go into your anxiety problems Some conversation starters might be what are your typical Sunday activities what is a band or album that you loved what was the last movie that you saw and what did you think about it what is the funniest thing youve ever seen in public  Dress appropriately This means that you wear something that you feel comfortable in but which also suits the occasion So if youre off to a 4star restaurant something a little fancier is in order a dress or nice slacks and a nice buttonup or blouse If youre going to a coffee shop dress just a little nicer than your usual attire button down instead of tshirt no ratty jeans etc Remember that you want to be yourself for the date You dont want your guy to be expecting you to be someone youre not further in the relationship Thats not fair to either of you You dont have to bring all your quirks out into the open right away but you shouldnt be hiding things   A good way to let someone know that youre interested in them and care about them is to take an interest in their interests and in their opinions about things You dont have to understand those interests and you dont even necessarily have to enjoy them but being interested enough to talk with your guy about them will show him that you are interested in him   For example if your guy is super into skiing and youre more the bookish type thats okay Make sure to ask him about his ski trips and even offer to go a few rounds yourself Pick up on some of the terminology so that youre able to converse more freely Make sure that hes also respecting and interested in your interests and hobbies If he isnt thats a pretty good sign that hes either a narcissist or not very committed to having a relationship with you   There is nothing that makes someone feel good and cared about than by showing them that they are not being taken for granted Find ways to demonstrate to him that you notice what he does for you and that you appreciate him in your life   Flat out saying I am so glad youre in my life is a good and easy way to make sure he knows that you value him Do some little things that show you appreciate him If youre crafty you could make him something knit a hat carve a special little box paint a picture Also you could do something thoughtful for him especially if hes having a really busy or difficult time Bring him some special cookies or help him by editing his resume or essay offer to drive his sister to the airport so he can get some extra studying in   This step is important for both of you You dont want to enter into a codependent cantbreathwithoutyou kind of a relationship as much as the movies make it look nice Make sure that youre both getting some space from each other and from the relationship   Maintain your relationships with your friends Hang out with them Have sleepovers and movie watching parties that are just with your friends no significant others allowed Pursue your hobbies and interests Go on ski trips by yourself or with your family go to knitting workshops learn karate This way when the two of you are together again youll have so much to talk about   Maybe in the beginning he seemed like such a great guy but its a good idea to check in with the relationship before you start doing a bunch of stuff to win his heart You want to make sure that his heart is actually what you want or even if its possible to win his heart   Obviously if hes emotionally physically or sexually abusive you should get away now If he isolates you from friends and family if he demeans you or tears you down either in private or in front of people if he manipulates you or forces you to have sex when you dont want to if he says hell kill himself if you ever leave him any of these signs mean that you should get out Some questions to ask yourself about your relationship are the two of you open and honest with each other Do you feel better with him or do you feel like youre walking on eggshells Does he respect you Do you feel like youre the best version of your self when youre with him Does he You shouldnt ever feel like you need to fix him or make him better You should be in a relationship with someone who doesnt need you to be their therapist or their mother   Sometimes the absolute best way to get what you want in a guy is to tell him how you feel and ask him if he feels the same way Often you can hint and hint for ages and do everything youre supposed to do and still you wont know whether youve won his heartBe open and direct Tell him that you really like him and that you want to see how he feels about you or how he might feel about you in the future Be ready to hear the answer even if it isnt one that you want to hear He might not feel the same way about you that you feel about him and thats okay Remember its his loss not yours

It isnât always about some elaborate way of getting her notice you and how youâre different in a great way Everybody looks a million times kinder and more attractive with a smile   Dont be creepy about it Theres a fine line between an attractive smile and the unnerving smile of a sociopath  This is not exactly a crazy idea nor is it one that you would immediately think of as guys tend to think about big heroic acts first The truth of the matter however is that you can impress a girl simply by being able to hold an interesting intelligent and hopefully exciting conversation   Itâs something that doesnt matter to most girls What girls really care about is attitude confidence and personality So if you talk to that girl that is supposedly out of your league and do it in an interesting way you may just find yourself on her radar real quick   You dont always have to be the best There are few things that irritate girls more than a guy who always has to be talking about how he is better than everyone else â at everything   Everybody has bad days but itâs up to you to put a positive spin on it Every gray cloud has a silver lining as they say and being able to find it is a very impressive ability   You donât have to slay a dragon or rescue them from an evil king Simply open the door for them pull out their chair let them wear your coat if theyâre cold or take their hand to help them out of the car or down some sketchy stairs  And have some manners will you please Girls are not even remotely impressed by burps farts or other young boytype behavior Far more often than not they find these behaviors crude annoying and just plain gross   Nothing gets a girlâs attention better than a guy who is having a good time with her friends Not only is the natural competition instinct triggered but she can see immediately that youâre likable and fun and that makes a lasting impression   This tells her that you donât care about what else is going on when youâre talking to someone â especially her The best is when they say something along the lines of âYour cell phone is ringingâ Why Because you can let her know that it canât be anything more important than talking to her Now thats impressive   Ask her advice Ask questions Compliment her answers her appearance a talent youâve witnessed her display or her new glasses Anything new about her or that catches your eye is a great topic to give her kudos on   Itâs just like meeting someone for the first time in person so itâs important to make the same great first impression Be honest about yourself and show her how you are unique just by being you  Talk about her Ask her what her likesdislikes are Ask about her favorite bands Find out what her favorite music is Send her funny memes or videos   When you do it at the right time with the right amount of silliness cheesy lines like âDo you believe in love at first sight or should I walk by you againâ can work like a charm It not only shows your sense of humor but that youâre confident enough to let her know youâre interested in her   This doesnât mean reading the directions on the box of mac ânâ cheese and pulling it off correctly Go to a website like foodchannelcom and learn how to make it from scratch practice it and then do it with confidence in front of her Sheâll be hugely impressed   If she finds out that youre not who she thinks you are not only will it be embarrassing but you will lose some major points as well If she doesnt like you for who you really are shes not worth your time and you can do better   If a girl sees you with your mom or sister and sees you have a good relationship with them and treat them well you have just made your likability soar This doesnât mean being obsequious it means being thoughtful and considerate  If they also see you playing with niecesnephews and how much the children adore you Thatâs huge bonus points   Some guys might take this the wrong way so understand if youâre a Tshirt and jeans guy then by all means where Tshirts and jeans But âââcleanâââ Tshirts and âââcleanâââ jeans not nasty grungy ones or cheap dimestore ones either It doesnât take a designer suit and tie though if thatâs your style then rock it it just takes some attention to how you look  Being clean is very important and not just regarding clean clothes That includes taking showers washing your hair brushing your teeth etc   They key difference between confidence and arrogance or narcissism is that when youâre confident youâre proud of your accomplishments or whatever it is youâve done but then you shift the focus of the conversation back onto her or someone else Itâs not all about you because you know who you are and are fine letting others take some credit as well   No one wants to date someone who does nothing in life because thatâs boring Women will be interested in knowing you more intimately if you have a rich and varied set of things that interest you You should also never be embarrassed by the things that interests you Is it geeky Then own up to it because that is a powerful attractor as well  These topics will also get you speaking passionately which just takes the whole likability factor to stratospheric levels Women love passion and showing you have it is key We all like to be around someone who makes us laugh For girls it is even more important as it speaks to the level of comfort and confidence that you have in yourself The key is to make sure that your jokes arenât at the expense of others That is a big tipoff that maybe youâre not so confident and need to put down others to feel better about yourself  This also true of being able to laugh at her jokes even if theyâre not all that funny Remember we like to be around funny people but we also like it when people laugh at our jokes Laughing out loud and the ability to do so without reservation is very appealing as well   No one likes a yes man A girl might like it at first â everyone likes to always get their way at first Eventually however it wears thin because you clearly have no opinion and thus no point of view which is profoundly uninteresting It could also mean that you donât respect yourself enough to say what you think which is also a major turnoff   Itâs scientifically proven that women are more emotionally fulfilled through talking and sharing This doesnât mean solving their problems if sheâs telling you about them It means really listening and demonstrating that youâre hearing what theyâre telling you  You can let her know your listening through nonverbal cues such as smiling laughing nodding or reacting appropriately to the emotions of the story Repeat back to her what she said Not verbatim but by summarizing what she said both reinforces for her what sheâs just told and that you are listening so attentively that you got it   Nothing makes a girl happier or gives her the warm fuzzies quite like knowing that a guy she is or even isnât thinking about is thinking about her This can be done in a wide variety of ways such as   Sending a link to a YouTube video you think she might like Text her a funny Vine Unexpectedly invite her to join your group of friends for a night out to a movie concert miniature golf of any other fun activity   A lot of women will pay attention to one very specific behavior to see what kind of person you really are how you treat your server at a restaurant Two other key behaviors they watch is how you treat animals and children If you score on all of these you just might have some swooning on your hands   A guy who is capable of leading of making decisions and getting others to follow them is very attractive to girls Couple this with being willing to admit mistakes and move on to make the appropriate and necessary changes and you have yourself a winning recipe for getting that girl to like you Women of all ages like to feel protected and nothing says that like being the man in charge who is adaptable and confident as a leader

While he or she may seem perfect in your eyes your crush is just like you When you have a crush you may be experiencing the halo effect which causes you to see that person as flawlessYou need to remember that your crush is a human being who makes mistakes and is no better or worse than anyone else including you   Try the old public speaking tip to calm your nerves imagine the audience is in their underwear In this case imagine your crush in a vulnerable or silly position in their underwear going to the bathroom or getting pottytrained as a kid Try not to think of your crush as the cutest smartest most perfect person but as that person I sit next to in biology Idolizing your crush may prevent you from seeing things that are not so good about them You might be so caught up in how cute they are you miss that theyre actually not a nice person and not someone you really want to be with at all  If you have third period english with your crush or you know youre going to see them later do something that will put you in a confident positive mindset It can be as simple as wearing your favorite color or a meaningful piece of jewelry Maybe just stopping into the bathroom before class to apply some lip gloss practice your best smile and make sure nothing is in your teeth will help you feel your best   Try wearing a necklace or ring that was a gift from someone who loves you When youre feeling nervous touch your jewelry to remind yourself that regardless of how things go with your crush there are plenty of people who think you are amazing Try striking a power pose before you see them Stand with your feet shoulderwidth apart hands on your hips shoulders back This wonder woman pose can actually change your chemistry making you feel more confident more likely to take risks and better able to cope with stress It can be as simple as saying Hey when you pass them in the halls or asking them what the homework was you forgot to write it down These little moments will make talking to your crush seem normal and not so scary Dont listen to advice that tells you to fake interest in your crushs passions Instead find out which passions you both share This can help humanize your crush and will also give you an easy way to start a conversation with them If youre obsessed with the same band and you can speak about them with confidence it might make it easier to talk to your crush without stuttering feeling nervous or not knowing what to sayUse this as a jumpingoff point to ask your crush about themselves People love to talk about themselves and usually think favorably about someone who asks them questions and listensAsk if your crush has ever seen the band live or which songs are their favorite Finding out your common interests can also be a good way to lead up to asking out your crush If you both love soccer maybe you crush will want to join you and your friends if youre still nervous at a match over the weekend   If you have a trusted friend who knows about your crush she might be able to take some of the pressure off your interactions Knowing you have someone in your corner can help you feel a little calmer and more confident   Make sure you trust your friend not to embarrass you If you have a friend who can sometimes be a little mean or likes to tease you then telling her about your crush might not be the best idea She might think its funny to try and make you blush or even tell your crush how you feel   Overreacting panicking screaming yelling or blaming someone else for what happened will become the true embarrassing momentWhether someone spilled your secret or you accidentally walked into a wall right in front of your crush keeping a level head will help you get out of the situation with as much grace and dignity as possible   Taking a deep breath can go a long way in calming you downTry to inhale for four seconds then exhale for four seconds As you are breathing think about what you will say instead of blurting out something defensive   So you just fell in front of the whole school at the pep rally Get up dust yourself offand laugh Say something like Wow that was embarrassing and keep going If youre able to laugh at yourself youll take the tension out of the moment and may even appear to be confidentPeople are more likely to be forgiving of those who own up to their mistakes If you acknowledge that you said or did something embarrassing there might be a little teasing but people will be more likely to let it goEven if you cant laugh about it in the moment try making a joke out of it later It will show you dont take yourself too seriously   You may be replaying an embarrassing moment over and over in your mindthe dumb joke you told in front of your crush that fell flatbut chances are you are the only one People often arent paying as close attention us as we may imagine and tend to judge others more on overall character than one embarrassing incidentIts likely your crush didnt even notice the thing youre agonizing over Or if they did it probably wasnt as bad as you think Obsessing over a moment in the past can be destructive and does little other than make you feel sad and angry If theres something to learn from the incident like to pause and think before you speak then take that lesson and let the rest go Remember that everyone gets embarrassed Each and every person from the president to your crush has been embarrassed   Dont run before you can walkpractice making conversation and even flirting with others before approaching your crush This doesnt mean leading someone on but flirting a little with someone less intimidating than your crush can boost your selfesteem and make flirting less nervewrackingTry approaching people you think are cute and asking them for the time Build up to striking up little conversations with strangers Stop putting yourself down and start replacing negative thoughts with affirmations It might be hard to believe but if you start telling yourself you are a smart interesting and kind person who deserves respect you will start to believe it Cutting out negative thinking and building yourself up can increase your selfconfidenceRemember that everyone struggles with selfesteem issues Everyone has flaws they are worrying about everyone feels low or like theyre not good enough at some time in their lives In fact most people are probably so busy worrying about their own flaws that they dont have time to notice yours Do things that make you feel good about yourself Exercise and eat right wear clothes that make you feel comfortable and confident   Filling your day with things you find interesting will help you take your mind off your crush and remind you that you are an amazing person with a lot to offer It can also help expose you to new people with shared interests and you can get to know them and further develop your social skills   Doing interesting things will make you more interesting Dont just talk about how you want to join the track team or learn to be an amazing cookmake it happen
When they receive the physical exercise they need capuchins will be more content and quietCapuchins need sufficient space to walk around in climb and jump Provide them places to sit so that their tail hangs below their seat without dragging on the floor Their cage size should be larger than 4ft x 6ft x 6ft but if you have the space an entire room would be more appropriate for your capuchin âCat treesâ that you purchase at pet stores also make excellent monkey trees   If your capuchin is loud and seems unhappy it might be lonely and need companionship Capuchins are social animals and they live longer happier lives in captivity if they are not isolated   Consider adopting another capuchin to keep your pet companyCapuchin monkeys also get along well with other species such as squirrel monkeys so this is also an option for a companion If you have to leave your capuchin alone turn the television on and they will be less lonely and noisy while you are gone Your capuchin might be vocalizing and acting out because it is bored and needs mental stimulation To occupy and quiet your capuchin monkey try out these toys or objectsTire swings and climbing ropes provide them with a lot of entertainment Capuchins like to handle things and tear them so give them soft items such as cardboard Make sure the toys do not have sharp edges or hazardous coatings Capuchins like things that are bright and shiny   Like other primates capuchins are known to spend considerable time playing with their reflections in a mirror This will provide great entertainment for your pet and help keep your capuchin quietUse a metal mirror instead of glass so your capuchin is not hurt if the glass breaks   Provide your pet with food that doubles as entertainment and keeps them occupiedGive them fruits seeds or nuts that they have to crack peel or separate A piece of fruit frozen in ice or a cob of corn will entertain and stimulate your capuchin making him or her less likely to be noisy For a fun treat hide peanut butter and honey in a PVC pipe or box and give your capuchin a straw or stick to retrieve it They will spend time focusing on this task instead of acting out   Itâs possible that your pet capuchin is being rowdy and noisy because it wants your attention   Take time every day to play with your capuchin
Once youâve spent some time getting to know your crush either in person or online see if theyâre willing to share their phone number This will allow you to reach out and chat via textAsk your crush for their number by using a shared class or project as an excuse Say âHey I could really use your help on the PreCalc assignment Could we exchange numbersâ Once you have each otherâs numbers you can start texting each other just to say hello Be bold and tell them you want their number to talk more Try âYou know weâve been chatting a lot lately Want to give me your number so we can text tooâ   Texting can act as a good way to slowly increase the amount of time the two of you interact Avoid sending your crush multiple texts before you receive one back and use emojis sparingly You can start by reaching out with simple questions which may then lead to longer more detailed communications   Try starting a conversation by mentioning seeing them earlier during the day and then asking them how theyâve been since you saw them For example âHey It was fun hanging out at lunch today How was your afternoonâ   See if your crush will join you in a group setting Ask them to come to a study session go out for drinks with friends or attend a game with several of your acquaintances Once youâre at the event interact with your crush and use the time to flirt a little Now that you know your crush a bit better youâre likely aware of the interests the two of you have in common These donât necessarily need to be dates and you can avoid defining them if youâd like Instead take the opportunity to increase your oneonone time with your crush on activities that show how many interests you shareFor example there might be a movie coming out you know your crush is excited about because you talked about last week Or you might have just found out that you and your crush are both avid rockclimbers Take advantage of these commonalities This question could look like âSo I know youâre really excited about the new Wonder Woman movie I really want to see it too but my other friends arenât into superheroes Would you want to go togetherâ If they ask you if itâs a date respond depending on whether youâre ready to âofficiallyâ ask them out You could either say âI donât really know How would feel about it being a dateâ Or âNo weâd just go as friendsâ Your other option would be to go for it and say âYeah itâs a dateâ   At some point it will be time to take the plunge and be honest about your feelings This conversation could be exactly whatâs needed for you and your crush to become something more They may even be too shy to tell you that they have a crush on youIf youâve already asked your crush to hang out with you oneonone this confession might be less of a surprise to them You can either confess directly saying simply âI really like you as more than a friend Do you like me in that way tooâ Or you can be more subtle âWeâve been spending tons of time together and I feel like we enjoy the same things We might have a lot of fun if we spent even more time together as something more than friends What do you thinkâ Be prepared for disappointment because itâs impossible to predict or control someone elseâs feelings Even though youâve interpreted your interactions as flirtation your crush may have thought you were just becoming good friends   You donât need to stop liking your crush and in fact you likely canât force yourself to do so However if they tell you to back off you need to understand that they have the right to make that choice This doesnât mean the two of you canât still be friends Besides if you stay friends their feelings for you may change
When preparing for your hamster to have her babies use a cage that is tanklike ie like a fish tank with glass walls You want to use a tanklike cage because it reduces the risk of the babies escaping through the wire bars if the cage you have is a wire cageAlso you want to have a cage that is only onestory high Cages that have multiple stories can cause the mother to make her nest on one of the second or third floors This is risky because one of the hamster babies could fall and hurt themselves or die  You want to clean the cage 3 to 4 days before the mother goes into labor Clean the cage as you normally would but add extra bedding Pad the cage with extra bedding material that you usually buy You can also add shredded pieces of toilet paper for extra bedding However do not use commercial fluff or wool to add extra bedding This kind of bedding can cause harm if the hamster eats it or if one of its limbs becomes caught in the fine fibersSigns that mother is pregnant and will be going into labor are a sudden increase in weight gain nipple protrusion an aggressive temperament nest building and an increase in eating and drinking Also remove the hamster wheel any hamster toys and tubestunnels that are inside the cage You want to remove these because they can injure the hamster babies If your pregnant hamster is sharing a cage with other hamsters move these hamsters to another cage These hamsters might disturb the mother and her preparations or they might harm or eat the babies once born
Right after you do something clumsy come up laughing This takes a potentially negative moment and makes it into a positive one It also makes it less likely that anyone will try to pick on you because of the incident They are more likely to laugh right along   This is a good way to build community with others on the basis of what might have seemed like a negative event They will likely agree with you and may even tell you a few stories of their ownYou could say âI hate when I trip over my own feet Have you ever done that beforeâ   If gracefulness isnât your strong suit switch the subject to something that you are good at When you start to talk about something that you are passionate about others will instantly be interested and will forget any prior actions on your part The dopamine that comes from relieving a hobby of yours will also help to calm your nerves downFor example you might say âI just went to this amazing concert last week Let me tell you guys all about itâ   Just after youâve had a clumsy moment take a second to look closely at your crush You may seem that he is sweating a bit or perhaps wringing his hands too These are signs that he is nervous as well It means that you are not aloneYou can also watch for erratic eye contact If he canât look you directly in the face he may be nervous He may blush as well   Your crush might be shy Or he might feel bad for you after an embarrassing moment and not know what to say Give him the benefit of the doubt and donât expect too much conversation until you get to know him better Be patient and keep trying to reach out to him in friendshipYou might start by simply saying âHiâ on a regular basis If he responds great If not then keeping moving on   If you are talking with your crush and his friends and find yourself growing more nervous turn your attention to your surroundings Look at the people around you and pay attention to what they are wearing Try to pick out your favorite elements of the room that you are in Try to stay engaged but a bit distracted at the same time If you want to gauge your crushâs level of interest in you without resorting to klutzy questioning then try to talk with him about relationships and friendships in general Ask him about his closest friends Talk to him about his family relationshipsPay attention to not only what he says but how he answers the questions as well Does he give you his full attention or are you an afterthought You might say âTell me about your best friend You said that he lives out of town rightâ   Tell your friends about your dilemma and ask them to walk around with you when you might run into your crush They will hopefully distract everyone from anything embarrassing that you might do They can also talk about your positive traits and give you a dose of needed confidence Make sure to return the favor when you can   You might tell your friends âI could really use your help when Iâm around my crush If you could start talking to everyone or distract them if I do something klutzy that would be greatâ
A guy who likes you online will often make time to talk and message with you For instance he might message you frequently even when you are offline You may also find that you spend hours messaging back and forth throughout the day and even into the night This is a sign that he likes talking to you and is making time in his schedule to communicate If you send a message to him and he takes over an hour to respond and you know that he is online this likely means that he is just being polite Alternatively if he messages back right away and then starts up a conversation he probably likes youSimilarly a guy who likes you will often message you as soon as you log onto Facebook messenger or any other messaging app   Some guys will respond to your messages just because they are polite If this is the case they will likely respond with short one word answers and will rarely try and engage in a meaningful conversation Alternatively if a boy likes you he will try to get to know you ask your advice or opinion or share stories about his day   If he is interested he might say how was your day or what are you up to this weekend These types of questions reveal that he wants to be apart of your everyday life   Boys will often flirt when they like someone Signs of online flirting include compliments light hearted jokes the use of exclamation points emoticons or bitmojisHe might say something like you look so cute in your profile picture   Never pin all your hopes or fears on just one or two online conversations Lots of people run their instant messengers in the background whether they have the time to chat or not His short responses may just signal that he is busy or preoccupiedIf this becomes a regular pattern it may be a sign that he is not interested in you
Saying Hi name and smiling as you pass her is a good way of doing this Ask her questions about herself eg How are you How did you go on the maths test Be friendly  When she talks to you show interest in what she has to say Make eye contact Try to keep the conversation flowing   Even if they are lame   Give her compliments like Your hair looks nice today or Thats a pretty dress Every girl loves a compliment   If she drops something pick it up for her If she doesnt understand a math question explain it to her   Sometimes a girl just needs someone to talk to about something bringing her down Sympathize with herIf she brings up an issue of hers make sure you listen attentively and offer constructive advice but dont overdo the advice   If she is upset be there for her If youre good friends with her hug her dont do this if you think she definitely doesnt like you   Dont overdo this step but occasionally let her catch you staring at her from afar When she notices you staring you can either smile or wink if you think you can pull it off or quickly look away   Playfully teasing her poking her gently and stealing her pen from her are effective and easy ways of signalling to a girl you like her If you want to take it up a notch gently make contact with her handYou can incorporate this in other types of flirting eg if you steal her pen hold it in your hand so that if she wants her pen back she has to pry it from your hand Also dont overdo it the girl may get annoyed   This gives her mixed signals often resulting in her constantly questioning whether you like her or not   Show her that you want to socialize more with her Ask her to the movies to hang out with some friends or ask her over to your house   And comment on some of her photoswall posts on FacebookMyspace but dont overdo this   If you dont know when it is ask by casually bringing it up in conversation Give her a card or a small present on her birthday or maybe even a hug   Every now and then ring her just to talk with her and see how shes doing   This is quite obvious but it gets the message across Be confident most of the time even if the girl doesnt like you she will let you down easy and nothing is more annoying than a guy that likes you but wont make a move
Focus your energy and emotions toward a new goal When you feel yourself missing your ex redirect these feelings toward a different goal or passion Obsessive thinking about your ex activates the same craving region in your brain as drugs and alcohol Replace your addiction with something productive   Working out relieves stress Excess stress can make you more likely to crave companionship Being single means you have more time to think about yourself Use this opportunity to redirect your attention back to your own needs and wants   Think about your professional goals This is a great time to push your personal growth at work or at school   If there is something you have always been interested such as cooking or a new sport now is the time to pick it up It will be a great distraction from your sadness   See your current pain as a temporary state With time it will pass Your mindset is essential to forgetting about someone Keep a positive attitude and tell yourself that you will get over her with time It may seem impossible to you now but if you view it as an impossible task you will never forget your ex
Though you may be desperate for your woman to fall in love with you you cant try too hard at first or youll scare her off Take it slow and let things progress naturallyIf youve only been together for a few weeks or a month or two then you should keep things light and fun Donât say âI love youâ yet or it may not have the effect youre hoping for   Of course every relationship moves at its own pace

personality to the woman you are interested in By being positive kind funny and thoughtful you can show her that you are a great guy who would make an excellent boyfriendTry making her laugh by telling jokes Remember to be kind to people Try to maintain a positive and upbeat attitude   You dont have to ride up on a horse to pick her up for a date but you should make an effort to treat her like a lady Part of being a gentleman is having stellar manners and treating people well If you do this then she will take notice and will be on her way to falling for you This doesnt mean that you should not be yourself and have to start acting formal all of the time It just means that you should try a bit harder to be polite and considerate of her needsHere are some things any old gentleman can do   Give her your coat if shes cold Use proper table manners Put her needs before your own when it comes to having the best seat the last bite of food etc Hold open doors for her Pull out her chair for her Be attentive to her needs in general   If you want a woman to fall in love with you then you have to show her that you see her as more than just an object or a trophy to be won Show her see that you care about who she is as a person about what she wants what her dreams are and what her experiences have been You shouldnt interrogate her but at the same time you have to make an effort to know who she really is besides the funloving beautiful woman you see in front of you Here are some things to ask her about   Her childhood Her favorite memories Her friendships Her relationships with her family members Her hopes for the future Her job or her career goals Her passions or hobbies   Always hanging around and calling and texting a woman will not make her fall in love with you In order to evaluate her feelings about you she needs some distance and space to think about you If youre always around asking what shes up to or telling her how amazing she is 247 that wont increase her feelings of love for you If you let her know you care but give her space at the same time then shell be much more likely to fall for youJust like guys are turned off by women who come on too strong so are women Find a balance between letting her know how much you like her and giving her space   If you want a woman to fall for you then you have to make her see that youre a person who is worth falling for not just a puppy dog she can keep on a leash Maintain your hobbies and work hard at a job that means something to you The happier you are on your own the more the woman will want to be around youFor example you could hang out with your guy friends spend time training for a marathon play guitar or pursue your favorite hobby   Another way to win a girl over is to give her compliments that actually mean something This means you should go beyond telling her how pretty she is and dig deeper to let her know which attributes really mean something to youOf course complimenting her looks will make her feel good too as long as its not the only thing youre complimenting Look for unique aspects of her personality or her life that are really worth complimenting and shell see that you really care Here are some things you can say   You always know how to crack me up even when Im having a bad day Youre so good at talking to almost anyone My Grandma Pearl could have talked to you for hours What a gift Ive never seen eyes that are the same shade of blue as yours   If you want to deepen your bond then you have to open up as your relationship progresses Donât tell her everything about yourself at first or she may feel like theres no mystery there But once youve been together for a while slowly let her know about the things that matter to you This could mean talking about your real dreams for the future discussing a complicated friendship from the past or even revealing your biggest fears   Try asking for her advice about things now and then to show her that you value her input If you want a woman to really fall in love with you then you have to be there to support her when she needs you This means anything from going to support her in the school play or building her up before a job interview Youll need to be there for her when shes nervous about something having a bad day or just figuring out her life Women look for this quality in a life partner and if you want her to really fall for you then she has to see that youll be there for her through the good times and the bad   Try leaving an encouraging note in her lunch bag sending her a confidence boosting text message or just congratulate her on her accomplishments   Trying new things now and then will help to keep things interesting and exciting in your relationship This doesnt mean you should get a motorcycle and start doing backflips in your living room but it does mean that you should keep an eye on the unconventional and exciting things that would take your relationship to the next level If you do the same old thing or talk about the same old thing all the time then the woman may begin to get a little restless   Ask your girlfriend what she has always wanted to do but never has Then plan an outing so that you can try that activity For example maybe she has always wanted to learn how to surf You can arrange for the two of you to take a surfing lesson together Vary your conversation topics as well If youre always talking about sports or the same old thing it may get old Read the news read literature watch documentaries and just do things that make you a more interesting person  so that you can keep her interest   If you want a woman to really fall in love with you then you have to work hard to make sure that her friends and family also like youBe kind and polite to her family be fun and sweet around her friends and most importantly show that you really care about her In the end thats the biggest thing theyre looking for  not how much money you make or how cute you are   Avoid getting in heated fights or political debates with her friends and relatives Its just not worth it If you really dont like one of the womans relatives or friends its best to keep your mouth shut in most cases The woman wont like it if youre threatening one of the relationships shes had much longer than shes known you   Surprising your girlfriend and doing thoughtful little things will show her how much you care Though you shouldnt be her love slave you should take the time to do little things that make her really feel loved and cared forFor example you can send her flowers on a random day send her a text to say youre thinking of her cook her a meal when you know shes had a long day or massage her feet if shes feeling tired   If you want a woman to fall for you then you have to make her see you as more than just a hot exciting prospect who is perfect for right now Let her see that youre responsible caring smart fun to be around and an allaround good longterm bet Be your best self and show her that youre Mr Right not just Mr Right Now   Being responsible is a big plus If she sees that you can balance your checkbook cook dinner and do what needs to get done shell be very impressed   Listening is crucial to the success of a relationship When she needs you to listen to her drop your distractions look her in the eyes and take in what shes telling you Dont try to solve her problems or give an opinion on everything  just be there and listen when she wants to talk   Demonstrate that you are listening by summarizing what she said and checking to see if you are understanding For example you could say something like âIf Iâm understanding you correctly you are feeling frustrated about your boss and the way she handles meetings Is that rightâ Ask questions to show her that you are interested in hearing more Stick to who what when where and how questions Avoid âwhyâ questions because they may cause her to become defensive Good communication is essential for

feeling ask about her day or just ask if theres anything in particular that she wants to talk aboutTell your girlfriend how you are feeling and when you want or do not want to talk as well For example if you are having a bad day and need some space let her know   Forgiveness is essential to a long lasting relationship All couples argue from time to time and your girlfriend is bound to make mistakes sometimes If you hold a grudge and refuse to forgive her for mistakes then your relationship will suffer Practice forgiveness when she does something that upsets you and your relationship will stand a better chance of survival Looks are not everything but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is good for you and good for your relationship If you want to ensure that you feel your best and she continues to enjoy the way that you look you have to keep taking care of yourself Make sure that you eat well exercise daily and get plenty of rest and relaxation If you really want her to fall in love with you  and to stay that way  then you always have to keep making the effort Youve got to bring her flowers on random days You should dress up for date nights Come up with new things to do together Never give up on trying to make her laughDont quit on her if shes in a bad mood Just keep working your charms and working hard to keep her Dont think that once youve both said you love each other youve got this in the bag You always have to keep making an effort whether youre 20 30 or 80   Assess your relationship every so often to see what has changed or what needs to change Research has shown that people undergo significant changes every 78 years and you will need to account for these changes in your relationship Whether it is a new job or a new interest it is important to address these changes in order to maintain a good relationship If you want your relationship to keep going strong then you should build a list of things that you do together You have to have a few things that are just for the two of you which you love doing together as you build your relationshipConsider taking some Sunday morning hikes reading together near the fireplace making Italian meals together going wine tasting or running races Keep in mind that this doesnt mean that you have to share all of the same interests  you dont have to go to yoga just to please her and she doesnt have to watch your favorite TV show with you if its not her thing Having your own interests that you maintain will help you grow stronger too   While you should work on doing things together its important to stay focused on your own goals and pursuits too If youre always together one or both of you may begin to feel smothered Keep on doing the things you love while making time for the person you loveTry setting aside a day or night where you spend time with your friends and she spends time with hers   If you want to make a woman fall for you and make it last forever then you have to tell her that you love her Do it at least once a day and say it like you really mean it These three words can make a big impact on your life  and your relationshipNo matter how secure a woman is in her relationship she will always like to hear that you love her
Most saddles have a removable leather strap called a girth or latigo that attaches with buckles to the tie on the horses right side some have a girth attached to the tie in which case you can skip this stepBuckle the girth securely to the tie that hangs down by the horses front leg on the right side of the horse Walk in front of the horse back to its left side and then reach under the horses body and pass the girth underneath the horses chest   The girth should be pulled up to the buckle on the left side of the horses saddle where it should be fastened much like the other side using a buckle   Cinch it tightly but gently dont force it to go tighter than feels snug and secure You should wait until the horse exhales to cinch it because if you tighten it while the horse has its lungs full of air it will be too loose when the horse exhales to be safeSome horses intentionally take a deep breath right before you tighten the girth When they do that they get bigger around so when they breathe out the girth is too loose  just the way they like it This is called bloating and some horses do it because a girth doesnt fit them or their skin is being pinched under the girth If your horse does this you might want to check that the girth itself is long enough for your horse and not causing irritation or painYou can secure the additional length of the tie by passing it through the Dring at the top of the tie wrapping it around the tie and pulling it through at the top like a mens necktie This will keep it up and out of the way of the horses legs even if the horse runs   Before you mount up be sure you didnt forget anything   Be sure the stirrups are down on either side Doublecheck that everything is tight because if its loose and you get on youll slide right off Be sure that the bridle is on correctly Now mount up and ride Donât forget to mount from the left side
If the pros overdo the cons it means you can deal with the bad things because the good things matter the most While making the list dont be too harsh on the cons Try to keep away from annoying habits like nibbles on his nails too much  If he compliments you or tries to make you smile when youre sad hes a keeper But if he insults you and yells at you throw that sucker away   You can never have chemistry with someone who you cant even express yourself with   Signs of yelling continuous teasing and criticizing you means hes not patient at all No it means that he doesnt like you or respect you in any way   Or does he hide you like you dont exist If you said yes to the first one hes capable of being a good boyfriend When he shows you off to his friends its a symbol of pride to him that hes with the most amazing girl in the world If not hes just trying to not seem so sprung   Dont get me wrong he does like you but he doesnt like you enough to be open  honest with you which is a key in relationships   If this guy changes his feelings with you because you arent wearing any makeup hes not the one for you A good boyfriend will like you for who you are whether you look a model or have sack over your head   If he does it means that he likes the thought of a hot hookup more than a stable relationship Dont rush to do things you dont want to do youre only a teenager   Its a pretty big key to relationships Relationships require good work and people change constantly to make each other happy If hes not willing to do that for you it means he doesnt care very much and you need someone that cares
Now that youve played hard to get its time to continue to be elusive while making the player want you The first thing you should do to make him really want you is to be mysterious Dont open up too much or talk about your past your hopes for the future or your biggest fears Instead make him guess whats really on your mind and speak in hints and innuendos instead of being honest   If you have to leave dont tell him where youre going Let him guess Make him figure out who you really are from what you love to do to how many siblings you have Let him do all of the work instead of doling out all of the information for him Dont keep him up to date about your schedule If youre busy over the weekend youre busy over the weekend You dont have to tell him its because youre celebrating your Aunt Marys 50th birthday   Part of the reason players play girls is because theyre tired of girls who drag them down fall in love or want them to do serious boyfriendlike things like go to the grocery store or let you cook a neverending meal for them Well if you want to make a player want you you cant drag him down You should be fun spontaneous and up for anything whether its a trip to the beach or a nice run through a rain shower   Always keep things light and fresh Remember youre trying to play this guy not marry him Talk about the fun things youll do that day or that week  stick to the present This player wont be in your future Laugh dont cry This is not the person who should see your insecurities or the things that upset you   Even though youre spending more time with the player you shouldnt make him think that he has your heart If you run into another guy you know dont be shy about flirting with the other guy And if youre going out with another guy tell the player about it like its no big deal If he knows there are other guys in your life hell want you even more because hell have the need to compete for you   If you really want to make him jealous you can even pretend that youre meeting another guy when youre not If another guy calls you when youre with the player dont be afraid to answer Be fun and flirty as you talk to the guy who called you   If you really want to drive the player crazy then you should show no signs of caring if you see him with another woman or if he gets a text from another woman Players thrive from having multiple women compete over them or from the rush of trying to juggle a few women without any of them knowing If you act like you couldnt care less if he sees another girl hell only want to make you more jealous   To gain the power to play a player you have to stand out to him Its likely that every other girl in his life has been jealous This is why youll be different If someone calls or texts him dont say Whos that Look bored or uninterested as he talks into the phone If you see another girl he knows be extra nice to her Show him that you dont view her as competition   Players are used to girls who text or call them all the time and dont give them any time to themselves Well thats where youll diverge from the pack You can call him or text him once in a while but let him do the majority of the communicating If he reaches out to you dont respond right away like you have nothing better to do than to sit by the phone and wait for his call   Dont waste time stalking his Facebook profile Go online to do your own thing If you know hes out leave him alone Dont text him or call him or hell think youre obsessing over him If he knows youre out and he texts you dont get back to him until the next day Let him worry about what you were up to while he was away   Maintaining your independence is a larger part of limiting your communication You should have your own busy life your own friends and even some other guys to date while youre seeing the player Dont make your schedule revolve around his make him shift his plans around to see you   If he cancels on you dont let him reschedule for the next day Tell him youre booked for the next few days Make him feel like he really missed out by flaking on you and he wont do it again When youre with him talk about your other friends or the fun things you do that dont involve him Let him see that you have a life outside of worshipping him   If you really want to play a player then you have to be a player Make him think that you like him while juggling him with two or three other guys Flatter him and make him feel special while knowing that everything you say is meaningless You should only do this if you really want to play the player or to get back at him for some reason Changing your lifestyle this extremely can get a bit exhausting
Its hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when youre in the middle of a crush but plenty of other people have been down this path before you Finding out how they got through it can kickstart your own inspiration to move on   Ask a friend or family member for help Most people can sympathize with love on some level and they might be able to tell you about their own experiences overcoming a crush Even if they dont have personal experience with this problem they can still give you some levelheaded advice Keep your eyes peeled for examples Once you start looking for it youll see countless examples of other people struggling Books movies songs and even news stories often center on someone grappling with an impossible crush Pay extra attention to the ones where someone gets over it and note what you can learn  Before you can get over a problem you have to acknowledge that it exists Allow yourself to say you have a crush and to experience all the complicated emotions that go with it   Consider writing down a few pages about how you feel Taking some time to express your emotional turmoil can help you feel like youre putting it behind you List the reasons why you developed feelings for the other person and why its not going to work Write it in a private journal or on a passwordprotected word processing document Or write it on a few loose pieces of paper and burn them later State your feelings out loud You dont have to tell anyone else how you feel but verbalizing your problem out loud âÂ even if youre the only person in the room âÂ can help it seem real and approachable It can be as simple as saying I have a crush on Steve and I hate that I feel this way   If youre certain theyre mature and capable of understanding what youre going through find a time when you can talk to them about it One of the most difficult parts of getting over a crush is letting go of your hopes for romance If your best friend is dating him then you just need to back off If you just give up youll likely be tormented by What if thoughts Telling the person gives the small chance that maybe they really do like you back but even in the eventuality that they dont you finally can just move on to accepting that You wont feel like you wasted a chance for happiness   Dont be demanding or creepy try to avoid talking about the physical side of your feelings as thats not relevant to what you really want to know Simply tell them how much you care about them and that you just want to know if they feel the same Make it clear you still want to be friends with them although you may need time apart to get over your feelings and that you want them to be honest Writing your crush a letter may be better for several reasons It makes it easier for you to explain how you feel without getting stuck and it also puts less pressure on them Give your crush a letter explaining your feelings and ask them to read it later when theyre alone Dont contact them for a day just to allow them time to think about what youve told them Try talking to them the next day when you have time alone If they avoid you understand theyre probably just a little intimidated and confused just give your crush space and try again in a while   Maybe the person youre crushing on is already in another relationship or youre separated by thousands of miles of distance Maybe the other person doesnt even know how you feel and youre unable to say Whatever the reason accept that theres an obstacle in your path and that youre choosing to walk away from it   Dont confuse this with personal failure The fact that you cant be with your crush has nothing to do with your inherent selfworth Relationships dont work out for a multitude of reasons and most of them are problems that cant be changed or improved Some things are beyond your control Accept the things about yourself that prevented them from having feelings for you Heartbreak typically begins with denial try to skip that stage Accept that perhaps you just werent compatible Be open to correcting flaws in yourself if you want to improve your chances next time but make sure not to confuse flaws with differences Bad hygiene is a flaw and something you can fix Liking a different kind of music or being a more introverted person are not and you shouldnt try to force yourself to change them It may seem like youd do anything to be with the person but deep down what you desire more than anything is for them to love you as you are Even if changing for them possibly resulted in them falling in love with the new you the relationship would likely quickly fall apart after the initial novelty Avoid becoming embarrassingly stubborn It might go deeply against your grain to admit that you cant do something and in most situations perseverance is an admirable trait There are times though when perseverance morphs into desperation and stupidity Chasing an impossible crush is one of those times Let it go   If you can try to give yourself some breathing room away from the object of your affection A lot of crushes are born of proximity or simply being around someone who happens to be remotely likable If youre not around this person as often the crush might peter out on its own   If youre crushing on a close friend Make yourself less available If you want to try to preserve the friendship aim to spend as little time as possible with the other person right now without hurting his or her feelings Or if you trust your friend to respond compassionately explain your problem and state that you just need a little space right now If youre crushing on a mutual friend If the friend of a friend is the problem try to bow out of group social events gracefully If you have to explain the issue to your first friend so that he or she wont take it personally If youre crushing on someone at school Take this opportunity to work harder on your studies and distract yourself from your crush Every time youre tempted to think about him or her open a book or drill flashcards instead Take different routes to class or sit elsewhere at lunch if you have to If youre crushing on a coworker Focus more on your work For the time being avoid group lunches casual midday conversations and events like happy hour If youre crushing on someone you cant physically avoid Mentally distance yourself instead Being in the same room as someone doesnt mean you have to think about them too Think about whatever task youre doing or daydream about all the awesome things youll do someday âÂ without your crush   If your crush is always hanging out in your current group of friends try broadening your social horizons Making new friends will distract you from your current misery boost your confidence and might even lead you to someone whos a better match for you Here are some places to start   Find people who share your hobbies Love trivia Swing by a few local pubs and ask about the next trivia night Into writing Look around online or inquire at local colleges to find a new critique group Play sports Search online for intramural leagues or look up the local chapters of leagues like the World Adult Kickball Association The possibilities are endless Get involved in service Volunteer at a local shelter or contact an organization that champions a cause you care about like humane treatment of animals or environmental cleanup Attend a few service events and strike up some conversations with likeminded helpers Take advantage of school or church groups If youre already attending a school or church that offers extracurricular activities get involved Partyplanning committees like for Prom or church dances choir service groups or sports leagues are all possibilities   Use this time to step back and reevaluate ways you can improve your own life instead of devoting all that mental capital to your crush Youll find a few distracting tasks to take care of and youll be bettering your own situation at the same time   Give yourself a minimakeover even if youre a guy Is your wardrobe feeling a little stale Have you had the same hairstyle for too long Pick up a few new confidenceboosting pieces for your closet or investigate a new haircut or color If youre not sure how to navigate your options ask a particularly stylish friend or family member for help Get organized If its been awhile since youve cleaned out your closetcargaragebasement get on it Sorting through old junk can be a meditative process and youll probably feel relaxed and accomplished when youre done Work out Exercise clears the mind â when youre so focused on pushing your body you cant afford to worry about much else besides breathing and moving Take up running swimming biking or another activity that can both improve your body and dejunk your mind Practice positive selftalk It sounds silly but it really works Look at yourself in the mirror a few times a day and say whatever it is that you need to hear It might be Youll find someone better or No one is worth all this moping Repeat it until you believe it   Getting over a crush is hard work and if it took you several months to become infatuated it might take long to dig yourself back out Accept that its a process and plan ahead so you wont be derailed by a sudden relapse Heres how to deal with one   Realize that you dont see this person realistically Limerence or the overwhelming feeling of infatuation that you feel around your crush can throw you out of logical thinking patterns and make you idealize your crush Repeat to yourself that no matter how you feel no one is perfect not even your crush and recognize that you are intentionally overlooking his or her flaws Treat it like a substance addiction You wouldnt point a recovering alcoholic toward a bar so dont put yourself in situations where youre tempted to fuss over your crush Steer clear of intimate situations and avoid frequent contact even if its over text or chat and not inperson Dont just transfer your feelings to a new target Finding a new person to attach all your feelings to is another form of relapsing â you might not be crushing on the same person but youre feeling the same emotions Making someone your substitute isnt fair to them because youre not seeing them for who they are and its not fair to you because youre allowing yourself to fall back into the same cycle   Demonizing your crush might help you get over it in a shortterm way but its not a longterm solution Heres the problem thinking about how much you hate someone is still a way of obsessing over him or her so youre functionally stuck at square one   Dont make someone else responsible for your happiness Sure maybe your crush didnt respond to your affections like you had hoped Maybe he or she even made it worse by teasing you or flirting incessantly knowing full well how you felt But whatever happened the only person charged with making you happy is you Youre responsible for taking yourself out of a bad situation and moving forward so dont hold your crush accountable for making you miserable Try to wish him or her all the best If you truly care about someone you want to see that person find happiness â even if its not with you Resist the urge to become angry or start making comparisons if your crush starts dating someone else Try to cultivate a spirit of being happy when the people you like are happy   This is quite tricky but very effective when done and understood in the right way Your crush caught your eyes for all the good qualities you saw on himher Now you have to reverse it You may think at first that your crush is so perfect but no everyone has their share of flaws and that is what you have to keep in your mind Time to stop dreaming   Think deeply about your crush and find as many ugly characteristics as you can find List it down on a piece of paper and read it repeatedly When you see him around do not look at the good Remember everything you wrote and dont lose focus
Smile often especially if you have a bright smile or youve been told you have a great smile When your crush says something funny laugh of course Just dont make it forced Introducing humor of your owninto a conversation is a great way to keep it positive and memorable and helps keep those smiles flowing naturally  Before you even speak to your crush you can give off positive vibes by having good posture Also remember to maintain eye contact during the conversation stay relaxed and use hand gestures confidently   If youre too quiet your crush might not have a reason to be attracted to you or worse might not even notice you This can be difficult if you are an introvert or if you are naturally a shy person With that keep in mind that overcoming shyness doesnât necessarily mean talking a lot It means speaking well and thoughtfully and initiating conversation Itâs more about how you speak than how much you speak There are a variety of good topics and ways to engage your crush in conversation   Find topics to agree on or laugh about This is a good principle of conversing with anyone find at least one area of common ground or interest in your conversation You might even try not to end a conversation until youâve found at least one source of agreement Stay current Mention recent movies books TV shows articles or other entertainment topics she might be familiar with The more mainstream the more likely she is to know your reference This is particularly helpful when you have a lull in conversation Stay positive Think of things that pretty much everyone likes hobbies pets vacations weekends dessert etc Not every one of these topics will apply but one or two probably will and the more general you are the more likely you are to hit on commonality Then take the conversation more specific from there Avoid negative or sensitive topics Save your discussions of politics religion class or race for another time Obviously you donât want to mention a topic that could lead to disagreement or even an argument So itâs wise to avoid these subjects If one comes up and you can see it heading in a bad direction try diverting the topic with a laugh and something disarming like âYikes I usually steer clear of that subject at a party That was a close oneâ   Of course before you land your crush you need to get to know her and striking up a genuine friendship is an excellent way A friendship will give you insight into her interests making it easier to find and share common interests and activities Friendships also build trustwhich is helpful when you get to the point of asking your crush out on a date After all no one wants to date someone sheâs suspicious or distrustful of   Consider becoming Facebook friends if your crush is digitally inclined and occasionally liking a post or two This keeps you on their radar and it gives you a glimpse into your crushâs interests as well Donât ditch your current friendsYou donât want to be too socially available or not available enough That means you still want to maintain your current friendships as theyâve always been Maintaining friendships will keep you grounded regardless of what ultimately happens with your crush On the flipside you donât want to overdo it by being too socially aggressive with your crush Avoid stalking your crush on social media or obsessing over himher Think of the association with your crush as an earlystage friendship   One of the best ways to show interest is to ask specific questions about herself You could ask about where sheâs from family work hobbies travels or favorite things to do Keep questions specific and lively but not too personal or private   At some point youâre going to have to begin casual flirting If your crush does it first great Reciprocate If not youâll have to initiate Physically a light arm or shoulder touch during conversation often works Verbally you can take your compliments up a level For example instead of saying she âlooks goodâ say sheâs âbeautifulâ And remember to smile and stay confident   Focus on yourself and your own successScoring a big win at work or joining a gym or sports team can give you the sort of confidence boost that crushes find very attractive Theyâll be able to sense the success but you can also talk about it Light bragging is okay as long as it doesnât sound arrogant selfpossessed or obnoxious   Landing love wonât happen overnight Itâs a process that includes baby steps and small victories along the way returned smiles returned texts great conversations and more The flipside of this is you donât want to rushYou could turn your love interest off by moving too fast or give her the wrong impression about your intentions So be patient and try to have fun with it   Remember the basics hair clothes hygiene and makeup if you like Wear deodorant and light cologne or perfume You donât want to overdo it or look like youâre trying too hard but you do want to look attractive So clean up well find something nice to wear and play to your strengthsâbe they hair eyes height etc   Remember this is what youâve been building toward a date with your crush Stay calm and make the date casual Chances are if youâve struck up a friendshipâor even just a good conversation or twoâyouâll have some idea already of what she likes to do and hence what might be a good first date   Ask directly and specifically You could say âWant to grab a drink one night after workâ or âFree to do coffee one day next week I can do Tuesday or Thursdayâ Once she says yes agree on a time and remember to get her phone number or email address if you donât have it already in case anything comes up the day of the date You can offer yours as well   Texting is a safe way of following up If youâve already had a phone call then call and speak instead or leave a voicemail Youâll usually want to follow up the next day but you could follow up the same day with something along the lines of âDid you make it home OKâ or âI had a fun time tonight Talk again soon Goodnightâ   By repeating the previous two steps dating and following up on dates you begin to establish a relationship This is what getting your crush is all about Ask if she prefers texting or calling and if sheâs open to calling call Itâs a sign of a closer relationship In the early days of a relationship try to remain on her radar by speaking about every other day and moving toward daily In person your goal should be to do something together about once per week   Having a sitdown or a big official talk about relationship status or Facebook relationship status is scary and can backfire Worry about relationship status details if and when they come up Instead remind your crush of your interest as if youâre an official couple âI had a great timeâ or âYouâre so much fun to hang out withâ are meaningful statements that show interest not obsession    Give compliments Be real and make your compliments about the things that you genuinely like about the person Also since we are talking about a crush the compliments can be suggestively romantic but not overtly romantic or sexual For example you might not want to compliment their physical characteristics directly but you could say something like âYou look great in that dressâ Contact your crush for no big reason You might text or call for no reason other than just thinking about the other person You can check in just to say hi or to say that you saw something cool that reminded you of the other person Keep it light and thoughtful and your crush is prone to be flattered  Give thoughtful gifts Everyone loves gifts Just beware of coming on too strong with a big expensive gift Also beware of gifts that are too intimate or suggestive Instead give thoughtful gifts based on her interests or your shared history Examples could be flowers a small work of art or a favorite food your partner mentioned You might also think of a gift based on interest areas such

One good way to do a little research and get to know someone before you confess a crush is to be friends on Facebook or follow them on Twitter If youre waiting stop waiting and reach out online first to make contact Having a couple of online chats can help break the ice when you finally talk in person   To get a conversation started when youre in person you can bring stuff up that you already talked about online or reference something that everyone saw on Facebook that day Good icebreaker   One of the most important things to find out before you confess a crush is whether or not your crush is currently seeing anyone If they are its probably a good idea to hang back because you dont want to make things overcomplicated for someone that you like   Online is an easy way to check or you can also just watch closely and see whether your crush seems to be committed Talk to mutual friends or ask around   Reach out to friends and acquaintances if you want to learn more about the person youre crushing on Find a reason to hang out with people that are friends with your crush and just start asking about them What do they like Do they like anyone Do you think theyd be interested All good questions to ask   Remember if it slips out thats not the worst thing to have happen Might end up making your job and your stress a lot easier   Find reasons to hang out with your crush but not in the context of a date or a oneonone hang out Get to know them better by inviting them to do things with your group of friends   Organize a simple group hangout like a movie night at someones house or a group dinner somewhere and invite your crush If youre still worried about approaching your crush that way have someone else ask If you find out you dont actually like them good At least you didnt confess a little crush and make a mistake for someone you dont actually have that much in common with   If you want to learn more about someone and find out whether or not you might be good together part of it is to just start opening your eyes a little Who does your crush seem to enjoy hanging out with What is their sense of humor like What do they like to do in their free time Spend some time paying attention and watching not in a creepy way to learn as much as you can   Watch for signs of body language when youre around each otherIf your crush starts using closed body language arms crossed and not making eyecontact it could be a sign shes not interested in you You might save yourself some grief
Invite her along whenever you plan to go out Make her feel part of the group if you are going with other friends or make her feel special by suggesting that the two of you hang out oneonone   You can also try to relate the conversation back to her from time to time For example you might say something like Hey Ted did you know that Karen is into that new video game you got too Shes already on level 5   If youâre going to an event like a concert or movie that requires tickets or travel or permission from her parents give her plenty of notice Donât wait until the last minute Show her that youâre thinking about her needs For example âHey me and my friends are thinking about going to see the Rockâs new movie up at that theater in Brockport next Friday You interestedâ   If you only made your plans at the last minute consider surprising her with a ticket Only do this if you can afford it or if you know someone else who can use the ticket as a Plan B if she canât go Then offer it to her casually âHey I was online last night buying tickets The show was selling out fast but it was too late to call you so I just bought you one in case you want it No biggie if you donâtâ   Donât stare off at something else when the two of you are talking Demonstrate your interest in her by giving her your direct attention Make strong eyecontact when you are togetherAt the same time donât just stare at her without blinking which might make her uncomfortable Instead   Look her in the eye when she is speaking to show her that she has your attention When itâs your turn to speak shift your gaze to something else Gather your thoughts before you respond When youâre ready to speak look her in the eye again By doing this she will feel that you are drawn back to her face again and again This is much more flattering than being stared at   Create a deeper sense of intimacy between the two of you by touching her Remember though be respectful about it Start by simply standing closer to her so that you could easily touch without having to reach If she seems fine with you standing in her personal space make light casual touches as you talk For example   If youâre in a crowded space lean into her when people brush by then joke about it âDang Iâm starting to wish I brought my mintsâ Touch her elbow hand or shoulder whenever something new occurs to you âOh Hey I forgot to tell you   â Nudge her sides or her elbow with your own to underscore a point or tease her âI bet that one shot of Ewan McGregorâs butt was your favorite part of the movie ehâ   Once the two of you are used to making playful physical contact step it up Add hugs or even light kisses to the mix Even though this might seem like crossing the line between âsubtleâ and âobviousâ donât back down As long as shes receptive show her that you care with more direct signs of affectionWhen sheâs upset draw her into a onearmed hug around her shoulders Give her a polite peck on the top of her head If you havenât seen each other in a while throw your arms open for a hug Greet her with âThere she isâ Or just put on an act as if you havenât seen each other in forever and do the same thing even if itâs only been ten minutes If she has made a point of dressing up or even if she hasnât take her hand Bow give her a gentlemanly kiss on the top of her hand and tell her how smashing she looks Quit saying goodbye at nightâs end and just give her a hug instead   Attend events that she is participating in such as sports games plays concerts recitals etc Forward her links to posts stories and memes that you think she would like âLikeâ her comments links and posts on social media Donât go overboard on this last one though Avoid making her think that youâre just liking everything for the sake of it When she tells you that you should check out this or that band show book or whatever give it a chance Show her that you value her opinion At the same time use this opportunity to learn more about what she likes so you have that much more to talk aboutHowever donât take this to mean that you have to like whatever she likes Speak from the gut be your own person and share your honest opinions
It should work out about right if you cut an angle about three inches lower on the edges Each board should look like a point   ie if the saddle length is 30 cut the center support board 27 Since 2x4s are actually 112 inches wide twice is 3 inches therefore subtract 3 from 30
The first step in getting a boy to kiss you is to have utterly kissable irresistible lips Nobody want to kiss dry cracked lips so get a good lip balm and apply it frequently for perfectly hydrated lips Before the actual kissing you should apply a light layer of lip balm so your lips are smooth and perhaps delicately flavoured You should avoid bright lipsticks and sticky lip glosses however as these can get messy and even ruin your kiss   For moisturization petroleum jelly or a lip balm stick will work well You can also try exfoliating your lips by gently rubbing them with a damp washcloth or toothbrush This will get them extra smooth If you have a date planned try preparing your lips a couple of days in advance Otherwise you should keep some lip balm in your purse for emergency situations  Always try to look your best around the boy youre hoping to kiss Youll feel way more confident if your hair looks good or youre wearing your favourite skirt and confidence is super important when it comes to kissing Try wearing a top that brings out the color of your eyes or apply a little mascara to show off your long eyelashes   Just be aware that looking your best doesnt mean you should go over the top You dont need to wear a ton of makeup and you certainly dont need to wear skimpy clothes Guys tend to go for girls who are natural and feel comfortable in their own skin so try to let your natural beauty shine through Smelling good also helps  if you have a date planned make sure your hair is freshly washed and apply a little of your favourite perfume though nothing overpowering on your wrists and behind your ears   This probably goes without saying but you should always try your best to have fresh breath whenever theres a chance of kissing You can do this by brushing your teeth as often as possible especially after eating You should also keep a little tin of breath mints in your purse so you can pop one as soon as things look promising Dont be afraid to offer him one either he might take it as a hint which is exactly what you want   Try carrying a travelsize toothbrush and toothpaste in your purse if youre planning on grabbing a bite with the boy you like That way you can pop to the restroom for a quick refresher after eating If possible use a little mouthwash as well You should also try to avoid eating foods with a lot of garlic anything too spicy or anything that might make you burp not attractive before or during a date   You want to remember your first kiss with this guy as romantic right Then make sure to choose an appropriate location Large loud parties in front of all your friends are not a good idea Youll feel under way more pressure and itll definitely make things awkward Instead try going somewhere private  but not secluded  like a park the pier or the corner booth in a cafe   You want to be somewhere that you can talk and see each other so he can pick up on all the kissme signals so a movie theatre isnt the best option If youre already pretty close you could invite him over to watch a movie together  just make sure that no parents or siblings are likely to barge in at any moment awkward   You shouldnt work yourself up about the kiss too much Of course its normal to be nervous but too many nerves can cause you to act jittery or distracted which might send him the wrong signals Kissing should be a fun enjoyable natural thing not complicated or terrifying at all But if those butterflies are feeling more like carnivorous moths there are a few lastminute relaxation techniques you can try    Take a few deep breaths If you feel the panic rising take several deep breaths inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth Focus on the breathing and nothing else and you will immediately feel calmer as deep breathing is associated with decreased production of anxietyinducing chemicals like adrenaline and increased production of relaxing and moodboosting endorphinsAsk yourself whats the worst that can happen Really  think about what could possibly go wrong with a simple kiss Are you afraid that youre not a good kisser Or that he wont like you any more if its bad Remember that kissing is a natural thing so its very unlikely that youll be bad at it especially if you like him and he likes you And even if the kiss isnt so great if thats enough to turn this guy off an otherwise amazing girl then hes not worth your time anyway  Laugh They say laughter is the best medicine and that goes for nerves too Laughing will immediately make you feel more relaxed and happy and make the whole situation less awkward Try cracking a joke even a bad one making a funny face or whipping out some silly dance moves to break the ice and get both of you laughing Things will progress much more naturally after that
Your brain chemistry is responsible for who and what youâre attracted to In fact according to experts physical attraction works a lot like addiction both stimulate brain chemicals like dopamine and oxytocinEven if heâs not into you it doesnât mean thereâs anything wrong with you itâs all down to the chemicals   Research suggests that our brains can tell within one second whether weâre physically attracted to someone or not  When people are physically attracted to someone they often show it through body language Most body language connected to attraction communicates two basic messages âIâm availableâ and âIâm into youâ   âAvailableâ body language cues are actions such as smiling eye contact and arms and legs that are relaxed and uncrossedâFertilityâ cues the ones that signal that the person is a potential mate for guys include actions such as standing straight calling attention to the hands and squaring the shouldersIf he leans in while heâs talking or listening to you or tilts his head towards you itâs a good bet that heâs into youGood news women tend to be better at reading body language than men See how he holds himself when heâs around you Men tend to physically take up more space when they want to display themselves as powerful and attractive so if heâs sitting with his legs spread apart or standing with his shoulders squared it may be a sign that he subconsciously wants to impress you   If his legs and feet are pointed towards you it may also be a sign that heâs interested in you Men who are interested in a woman also tend to physically interact more with other guys If your crush and his buddies are hanging out with you and he playfully bumps shoves or elbows his friends a lot especially if they donât do the same he may be trying to signal that heâs the dominant guy in the pack and wants you to check him out When people find someone attractive their bodies undergo some automatic responses that display that attraction Knowing what to look for can help clue you in to how he really feels about you   Flushed cheeks suggest arousal This is the reason some women choose to wear blush it mimics the natural flushing of sexual excitement Some people also blush when theyâre feeling awkward or uncomfortable though so donât rely exclusively on reddened cheeks to tell you whether he likes youLips also tend to get redder and more plump if someone is aroused If he licks his lips when heâs around you he might be subconsciously signaling you that heâs up for a kiss Our pupils tend to dilate when weâre physically excited so if his pupils are bigger than usual it might be an unconscious signal that he likes you Winking is another cue that is often associated with attraction Smiling can mean that he enjoys being around you However pay attention to which muscles move when he smiles If only the muscles around the mouth move the smile probably isnât genuine and it could signal that heâs trying to hide discomfort or awkwardnessThereâs a reason why Tyra Banks is always telling her protegees to âsmile with your eyesâ Smiles that appear genuine will involve muscles around the eyes as well as around the mouth   People who are really attracted to someone will try to incorporate physical contact into their interactions If he casually brushes your arm while heâs talking to you or goes in for a hug without invitation he may be interested in you   Understand that some people are just naturally more into touching than others Some touching such as a handshake or a shoulder push may just be âfriendlyâ territory Other types of touching such as on the forearm around the shoulder near the waist or on the face are more likely to be connected to attraction
Accept the grief sadness loneliness regret anxiety guilt insecurity or other negative emotions in the order they come to you Let yourself be sad and let yourself heal Ultimately the surest path to getting over someone is to be honest with yourself  Dont bottle up your emotions Ask your support system for advice and try to understand what went wrong If you arent sure what to do next these people may have the wisdom and insight to guide you   Talk to parents older siblings aunts uncles grandparents â anyone that you feel comfortable asking for insight You may even feel comfortable asking a favorite teacher or a leader in your community Be careful who you trust If you are spilling your guts to someone for whom your crush is a mutual friend make sure that this person wont pass along what you say It may be harder to get over the guy if theres gossip floating around   Consider that there are hundreds of thousandsâeven millionsâof people with whom you can fall in love He may seem like the one but this doesnt mean that he is the only one Nor does it mean youll never find someone like him again   Think about why this crush didnt work out Maybe you were into him but he wasnt into you maybe he was in a relationship already or he had eyes for someone else maybe you said something to turn him off or he did something that made you decide that he was bad news Whatever the circumstances you cannot take back what has happened You can only absorb this learn from it and grow   Think about what you would have done differently You might be able to successfully navigate a crush situation in the future by analyzing what went wrong with this guy Think about the sort of person that you want to pursue Maybe this guy just wasnt right for you even if you found yourself attracted to him Consider which qualities will guide your future crushes and which personality traits you want to avoid   If you know where he hangs out at lunch avoid that area altogether Find a new way You may wind up thinking about him even more if you walk near him or you see him talking with someone else If youre going to forget about him you cant keep hanging around   If you have mutual friends consider spending less time with that particular group until youre sure that youre over him If you dont want to give up your social circle try focusing your attention on other members of the group instead It may be hard to avoid this guy if you have classes together you work together or you are frequently drawn together by other commitments clubs teams etc Again try to focus your attention on other members of that group or try to interact with the guy in a platonic way   If he tries to talk to you dont let yourself fall under his spell Try not to fully engage in the conversation give him short answers and slip away as soon as you can You dont need to be rude â you just might have an easier time forgetting about him if you arent always talking to him Bear in mind that if you have mutual friends or mutual obligations you may eventually need to learn to interact with him in a platonic way   Its hard to forget about someone if theyre constantly popping up in your peripheral awareness Facebook stalking this guy will keep you emotionally attached to him but it wont make him feel the same way â and it isnt healthy to fixate on something unattainable This will take discipline but it will keep you grounded in the long run   If youre friends with him on Facebook but you dont want to unfriend him consider stopping notifications on his posts This way none of his photos or statuses will show up in your Newsfeed Train yourself not to wonder about him Whenever you catch yourself reading one of his updates stop yourself and keep scrolling Let go of him and focus on the next thing Eventually you may be able to completely disengage your interest from him   This might include pictures of the two of you together or a CD that he gave you or a pen that you let him borrow â anything that keeps you thinking about him If the things belong to him give them back If the things belong to you give them away to a friend or a donation center Let these reminders slip from your life and you may find it much easier not to think about your crush   If you are constantly fixating upon what your crush is doing you will find it much harder to forget him Think about what demands your focus right now maybe you have a big test coming up or an exciting trip or a big game this weekend Try to divert your attention away from your crush so that you can move on Throw yourself into your hobbies your passions and your obligations and try to keep your mind engaged in the present   If you cant think of anything big thats coming up try to focus on things that you can look forward to each day Think about how lucky you are to be able to eat lunch with your friends on a daily basis Think about the satisfaction that you get from practicing music or practicing a sport and feeling yourself gradually improve   If you have an especially rough time getting over this guy you might want to take at least a few weeks to bring your emotions back into balance Focus on school on sports friends hobbies â focus on anything that you love Try to bring yourself back in line with your nonrelationship goals   When you find yourself drawn to a new guy ask yourself whether you are ready It can be a wonderful experience to let yourself fall for someone but make sure that you are prepared for the emotional ride Be careful not to simply replace your crush with another guy Ask yourself and be honest are you shifting your feelings onto this new guy without giving yourself time to get over the first guy If so consider taking it slow Some people advocate the rebound strategy find a guy for whom you have a purely physical attraction and dont let it get too serious You will need to decide whats best for you â but be careful not to play with someone elses feelings as a way to deflect your own pain   You will know that you have fully moved on when you can hold a normal nonselfconscious conversation with this guy Try to change your emotional association with him from crush to friend You may not work well as romantic partners but you may find that you become great friends If you are already friends with the guy and you dont want to throw that friendship away you will need to learn how to be platonic
The success of training a capuchin to be quiet will depend on whether or not your capuchin respects you and bonds with you Here are a few important things to keep in mind to increase the strength of your bondEvery time you go near your petâs cage stop and speak to your monkey Call it by name Offer it food or a treat Make sure you care for your capuchinâs needs and play with them daily Be patient because capuchins are known to be wary of strangers Donât expect to bond with them and train them overnight To get your capuchin to listen and follow your commands to be quiet you need to show your pet that you are in a dominant position   Feeding caring for and playing with your capuchin will show them you are in charge of their care and they will depend on you Be kind but firm Do not use physical force to emphasize your point because your capuchin might respond aggressively and lose trust   When your capuchin is quiet and calm make sure you offer positive reinforcement in the form of a treat or praiseMarshmallows yogurt covered raisins mealworms or another favorite food works well You can also use a new toy or object your capuchin will find interesting   If your capuchin is behaving badly and wont be quiet put your pet in their cage and walk away Do not look at your capuchin or interact with it for about 15 minutesThis teaches your capuchin that their behavior is unacceptable Because capuchins are social creatures they will find this time out upsetting and try to avoid it in the future   Physical punishment is not effective since capuchins often interpret this as a threat and respond aggressivelyTaking these actions jeopardizes your relationship with your pet Physical discipline often results in more negative and violent behavior such as biting If you feel yourself getting frustrated with your capuchin itâs best to take a break so you donât lose your temper Use the same commands or words with specific actions so that your capuchin will associate the action with the command   For example use âQuietâ when you want your capuchin to be quiet Donât change things and start using the command âSilentâ   If your efforts to quiet your capuchin donât seem to be working and they are unusually loud itâs a good idea to ask for help from an expert   Get in touch with your veterinarian to make sure your pet is not ill or injured Contact an animal trainer Although specialized trainers might be difficult to locate in your area it is worth researching online For additional resources and communication with experts join the Simian Society of America a nonprofit organization established to improve the welfare of primates in captivity
The best time to confess a crush Right now Theres no use in waiting because youre only giving your crush the opportunity to start dating someone else or find someone else to crush on and forget about you If you know someone and like them the perfect time is now   The only time you should wait is when your crush is currently dating someone Telling someone that you like them while theyre in a relationship can make things kind of complicated Its best to find someone else to crush on for a while and return to the person later when theyre single   Despite what you may think telling someone that you like them shouldnt be a big deal Even if they dont feel the same way itll be such a nice thing to say Especially if you approach them in a calm and cool way being gentle and humorous in your approach Make it easy and try to take the pressure off yourself   Build yourself up before you do it Look in the mirror and say I got this Im a cool person my crush should want to be with Then go put yourself out there Look your best on the day you decide to do it Wear clean stylish clothes that fit you well and flatter you and make sure youre freshbreathed and cleanhaired If you dont know your crush very well it can be kind of difficult to confess a crush The last thing you want to do is to take the risk of saying so and having them say Wait who are you If youre not sure whether or not the person knows you go up to them and introduce yourself   It doesnt have to be complicated Hey I dont know if you know me real well Were in the same grade I think we had Mr Robinsons class last year Well Ive wanted to tell you something for a while   The best way to have this conversation is in private Its important that both of you feel as comfortable and calm as possible to avoid making this a superbigdeal but its also good to have a little privacy so its less embarrassing   Passing between class periods can be a great time to catch someone really quickly Right after class or when youre leaving the same class is a good time too Or you could try to sit together on the bus Just hang back and say Hey can I talk to you for a minute Never go up to a crush while theyre in a big group or try to confess in the middle of the lunch room while everyone can hear you It can be really awkward if it doesnt end up going well Its a private conversation so do it oneoneone   If you say I like you and your crush says I like you too then what Are you just going to say Wellcool No Its important to have a specific date in mind so you can follow up   If a dance is coming up say Cool I hoped maybe we could go to the dance together Would you like to If theres nothing school related or youre not in school say I hoped we could get a bite to eat sometime Want to go for pizza this Friday Say around 7 In some cases it might be better to not rush it Dont expect much of an answer if you tell someone that you like them They may want to think about it for a while Thats a good thing Dont worry about waiting   The big moment doesnt have to be a big deal Theres no point in making it complicated or supercreative when the content is I like you Just introduce yourself smile and say You know Ive wanted to say this for a long time Ive always noticed you and you seem really cute and sweet I find myself thinking about you I like you a lot   Dont follow a script when you Try to talk Lots of people who feel awkward in this situation think it will be better if theyre reading from a script but thatll just make you sound like a robot Talk naturally as if you were talking to one of your oldest friends   You know what It happens Its happened to everyone Being rejected might sting a little at first but its a whole lot better than wondering what might have happened if youd have said something but didnt Youll grow up youll move on and so will your crush Just get out there and go for it   If you get rejected just smile and say Well Im glad to know at least Have a good rest of your week Never complain scoff or do anything dramatic Even if youre feeling upset at least you know now and can move on
Your horse should be haltered and tied before attempting to put the bridle on Keep them tied fairly short on the lead If the lead is too loose they may have room to avoid you However you dont want to tie the horse so that it cant move at all For many horses this will increase their hatred of the bridling process You want the lead just loose enough that they cant lift their head out of your reach  If your horse keeps throwing its head you can keep it still by resting your hand on its head Hold the bridle in your left hand and reach over the horses head with your right so that your hand is sticking between its ears If the horse tries to move its head gently press down on the top of their mane to encourage them to bend their head towards you Hand the top of the bridle to your right hand and take the bit in your left hand resting it against your flat fingers Use your right hand only to hold the bridles weight Gently press the bit against their lips If the horse doesnt take the bit then you can encourage them to open their mouth Keep the bit resting against your flat fingers on your left hand and slip your thumb into the upper corner of their mouth Rub the gums until they open their mouth Gently slip the bit in their mouth Keep gentle pressure against the teeth but be sure not to knock the bit against their teeth This is painful to the horse and it will make it more difficult for you to bridle themYou may want to practice putting your thumb in without the bit first Make sure that you are reaching in the side of the mouth where there are no teethThis will prevent biting and injury
Body language can go a long way in helping you see whether or not the girl really likes you Her words may not tell you that she likes you but her body can give her away If the girl really likes you then she may turn her body toward you and try to lean in when shes talking to you so she can get a little closer Here are a few more signs that shes into you   See if she twirls her hair or looks down at her feet This means that shes feeling shy and nervous about talking to you because she likes you See if she shuffles her feet or plays with her hands or jewelry This is another sign that shes fidgeting because she likes you See if she breaks eye contact If you share a moment of intense eye contact and then she looks away it may mean that shes feeling shy about talking to you Check out her smile Does she smile when shes talking to you even you dont say anything that should make her smile This may mean that she likes you  Do you notice that she dresses up more when she knows shell be around you If you know youll be running into her at the mall and shes all dressed up and wears more makeup than usual it may be for you If she knows shell see you on the weekend and puts on a new dress she may be trying to look good for you   She may also put on a hint of perfume if she knows shell be around you If you dont think she wears perfume during school but suddenly puts it on when youre at a group hang at the movies it may be for you   This is a dead giveaway that she really likes you If you catch her blushing after you look at her or if her face turns bright red in the middle of a conversation with you then shes feeling shy because of how much she likes you Observe her for a while See if shes the kind of person whos just really shy or if she blushes only for you If she only blushes in front of you then she thinks youre special
Dont change things around otherwise it wont be confusing   or something like that This will be SO convincing   Say that he called you to ask you out and if you can show your call history and make it seem like he called you at those times to ask you out and you know it was only to have a casual conversation really   You can do all kinds of settings to make it look like you really did text each other Make believe he texted Will you go out with me and you replying YesÂ  You might want to avoid the banners that may appear on the pictures too that show where the picture was made from That would be a dead giveaway
If you have feelings for a friend you can start changing the relationship by taking the lead in changing your behavior So donât just wait around expecting them to make the first move Initiate a conversation or ask your friend on a date If you want to transform your friendship into something more youâll have to take the lead on changing that relationship In a healthy friendship people demonstrate that they care about one another in a lot of different ways but if youâre trying to move past friendship youâll have to demonstrate the fact that youâre feeling new feelings   You can demonstrate your feelings by writing a note or a card or buying your friend an unexpected gift with a note that says âthis reminded me of youâ You can also just ask your friend what you can do to make them feel loved or appreciated This indicates that youâre looking for ways to take the relationship to the next level without having to have a direct conversation One of the easiest ways to change your behavior and demonstrate to your friend that youâd like something more is to flirt Compliment their clothes or their hair or the way they do something â sing speak play an instrument Tell them they look handsome or pretty They should get the message pretty quickly that youâre interested in being more than friendsYou can say something like I really love the way that shirt looks on you  it brings out the color of your beautiful eyes You can also say something like I could listen to you play guitar all day long It melts my heart   If you want to change your behavior and change your relationship you canât rely on the same things youâve always done together Suggest a new restaurant â maybe something with candlelight â or pick a new spot for drinksYou can invite them to drinks by saying Theres a new bar downtown  it seems like a sort of romantic place I know its not what we usually do but I thought we could change things up a bit You can also invite them to do something you dont normally do like going for a walk by saying I was wondering you wanted to go for a walk with me Itll give us a chance to just talk and be alone
Your friend asked you out on a date but you donât want to join him Instead of lying and potentially getting caught in that lie just give him a quick reason why you canât Choose something that doesnât allow room for interpretation Just a simple explanation will suffice   For instance when he asks if you will go to the movies with him just say âSorry Iâm busyâ and leave it at that Eventually he will get the message  No one likes to be rejected Unfortunately the rejection can hurt even worse when it comes from a friend with whom you want to take things further The truth is the situation is going to be awkward no matter what Youâll just need to accept it and hope things return to normal   Bring up the weird feelings to your friend You could say âI hate that things are awkward between us right now I really donât want you to feel weird around me and I hope we can get back to how we used to beâ Saying this lets him know you are aware of the awkwardness and that you want to retain the friendship Now the rest is up to him You owe it to your friend to be up front about your feelings Simply tell him youâre not interested but do it in a kind way especially if you want to keep the friendship intact He may not be able to only be friends with you but youâll feel better knowing that at least you tried   You could say âIâm flattered you feel like that but I donât want to risk hurting our friendship You mean so much to me that it would break my heart if we broke up and then werenât friends anymore I think thatâs how we need to keep it just friendsâ Because of your relationship you will likely see and talk to each other frequently Therefore it is even more important that you draw a clear line in the sand Let your nonfeelings be known so that he doesnât continue to ask or try to pressure you into a relationship   You can say âNow that weâve talked about it I donât want to discuss it anymore I think itâs best if we just close this topic for goodâ
This includes apples oranges strawberries and so forth If you want get some lettuce as well   Try not to mash the pieces together or it wont taste as good for the guinea pig   You may have already put some apples and oranges in your salad but this will help bring out the flavor This step is optional   Note By natural this mean squeezing the juice straight out of the orange or apple Do not use the orange juice or apple juice you would usually drink
You dont need to be a brain to find things to talk about but you do need to have passions and interests A person who can talk naturally about things hes interested in is always better conversation than someone armed with prewritten prompts and a vague hope of getting a date   Make a short list List everything youre interested in Go for more detail rather than less For example instead of âmusicâ write âplaying classical guitar going to concerts collecting old funk LPsâ Expand the list into topics Using the example above you might think about what brand of guitar you own or rent versus the brand you wish you could have what concerts youve been to and what funk bands you enjoy Make a mental note of your opinion on each topic This will help you to know yourself better When you talk about any subject you have an interest in youll be able to speak confidently about it and explain why youre interested in it which makes for good conversation   Get used to talking or youll never be able to talk well One of the easiest and simplest things you can do to improve your comfort level is simply to say things aloud to yourself This helps you get comfortable with the sound of your own voice and with speaking rather than simply responding to others   Find a time and a place Whenever youre home alone is a great choice It doesnt have to be regularly scheduled just seize opportunities as they arise Say something Try to talk a little bit about something rather than just mumbling a few words Tell yourself about the plot of the last TV show or movie you watched If you cant think of anything to say find a book and read aloud from it  When reading from a book try to make the words sound natural rather than the stilted sightreading drone that many people lapse into Read a sentence or two in your head first then say them aloud as though you had just thought of them yourself Books of poetry are ideal for this Poetry is almost always meant to be read aloud and the concentration required to be able to read a poem naturally will help distract you from feeling silly   Keep talking for a little while Try to speak out loud for at least a minute Over time this will help you get used to initiating conversations and speaking your mind which are important skills for making a good impression on your crush   Wherever you interact with women on a regular basis â work school clubs or elsewhere â make an extra effort to engage in small talk with them This will teach you that there is nothing to fear about talking to a girl even if you have a crush on her   Start with people you already interact with a little bit like coworkers Ask them how their week has been going and use short questions to encourage them to talk more Most girls will be glad to talk with you for a moment  If a girl asks about your week after shes told you about hers do the polite thing and tell her in about the same level of detail she used when talking to you Leave out the fact that youre trying to get better at talking to girls   Be friendly with project partners At school or during community service you will often be paired with a partner When your partner is a girl you dont know very well a little geniality will go a long way towards making things comfortable for both of you  Try talking about the project rather than asking about her If she responds well continue on and mix in small talk and simple questions as you go along  Dont ask her about herself or her life Instead ask her what she thinks of another person such as the teacher or an upcoming event you both know about   Dont talk too often Show that youre primarily interested in being helpful and completing your project together Speak as thoughts come to you rather than pushing the conversation along     If you want to make a good impression on a girl the very least you can do is control your behavior and your hygiene   Keep up a daily hygiene regimen of bathing face cleaning tooth brushing and hair care Wear deodorant Clip your fingernails regularly  If you wear cologne remember less is more Spray enough onto your wrists and the base of your neck that you can smell it from a foot or two away at most but no more Good cologne will dry down and last several hours there is no need to overdo it   Always dress your best Use clean clothes and plan outfits the evening before you wear them so you dont have to make lastminute substitutions Be on your best behavior You dont have to stop being the class clown if thats who you are but you shouldnt say or do anything that you wouldnt want your crush to know about You never know what might get back to her Be kind and forgiving with others and avoid getting into trouble with higherups   Whenever you see a good opportunity to speak to your crush alone for a moment even if other people are around step up and do it   Get her attention Call her name and wave at her while smiling Look happy to see her Meet her Start walking up as soon as shes acknowledged you Dont wait for her to come over to where you are Show youre proactive and confident by closing the distance yourself  If she looks upset or bothered by your greeting or tries to pretend she doesnt hear you she is most likely not interested in getting to know you Cut your losses and move on You deserve someone who will be glad to see you     By now you should be comfortable talking to girls and confident that youre an interesting person with things to say on a variety of subjects This is your chance to make a great impression with the skills youve developed   If you dont know your crush introduce yourself and tell her where youve seen each other around Once she recognizes you shell probably ask you a polite question like âwhats upâ or âhows it goingâ Dont answer dismissively instead think on your feet and say something in response that will move the conversation along  If all else fails say that you just saw her and thought youd come over and catch up for a bit This allows you to jump into a conversational lead with the next statement     Ask her about people and places you both know Respond lightly when she answers your questions and use gentle humor to offer your opinions   For example if you both had a class with a teacher named Mr Smith who always seemed tired you could ask her about Mr Smith and respond with an observation about how tired he always looked when she answers your question   Smile and dont be afraid to look at her while shes talking Remember the old saying âlaugh and the world laughs with you cry and you cry aloneâ We make our best impressions when we make others feel happy to be around us   Leave serious and sad topics out of this conversation If one has to come up for example if she asks about someone and you know he just died be honest but dont let the conversation dwell in that spot   If theres a lull in the conversation but its otherwise going well tell her about a recent event in your life that has to do with one of your personal interests Continuing with the musical example from previously you might bring up a concert you recently attended or an album you recently bought   Dont get too into your own interests Keep it general enough that she can follow whats being said without having any special knowledge Make plenty of room for her to interject or change the subject The important thing is to keep your conversation interesting and alive   Tell her it was great to talk with her and suggest that the two of you get together again soon then ask for her number Depending on how slowly you want to take things asking for a phone number outright might not always be an appropriate step but its a good middle ground between simply saying goodbye and asking her out on the spot   Alternatively just ask to be Facebook friends or request her email address This is less blatantly an invitation to date than asking for a girls number and most people dont mind giving out online information   Tell her youll call or otherwise contact her soon and leave her with a smile and a wave If all went well you should be looking at a gettogether or possibly even a first date within a week or two
If you really like this boy tell him that Figure out what you want this note to achieve Do you want him to give you his number so you can text him Ask for his number in your note Do you want to hang out with him after school Ask him to come over to your house to watch a movie Figure out what you want to achieve with your note and writing it will become so much easier   Be honest with yourself as well Dont tell him its okay if he doesnt like you youre okay with just being friends if thats not true Make sure whatever you put in your note is truthful otherwise youre starting off on the wrong foot Itâs also okay to say you donât know what to say Telling him âI donât know how to tell you this but I really like youâ is very endearing and heâll be flattered that you were even brave enough to try  Thereâs no right way to tell someone you like them so you can feel free to be as creative as you want Try writing a poem to let him know how you feelYour poem doesnât have to rhyme if you donât want it to There are many different types and lengths of poems so fool around and see which one feels right for you If all else fails go back to the classics You canât go wrong with a little âRoses are red violets are blue this poem is stupid but I still like youâ   If you have trouble putting what you feel into your own words use somebody elseâs Include a quote from your favorite movie or book or add a song lyric that makes you think of him It doesnât matter what you say as long as he gets the idea that you like him Use your note to express things you might be embarrassed to say in person Compliment his hair or his clothes or his personality whatever it is that makes him attractive to you tell him Even if he decides that heâs not interested in you heâll still appreciate the compliments   If you and your crush are already friends chances are you have at least one inside joke Include that joke in your note these details are unique and specific to your relationship and heâll appreciate that you thought to include it Your love letter doesnât just have to be a letter If you feel selfconscious explaining yourself in words try explaining yourself in song Make your crush a mixed CD or playlist of all the songs that make you think of himIf youâre artistic draw him a picture of you and him together   Whatever you decide to give him make sure you include some kind of note with your name on it You wouldnât want to give him a gift and make him guess where itâs coming from The note with your gift doesnât have to be highly detailed It can be as simple as To Jack From Jill The gift is what youâre explaining yourself with so the note accompanying it can be very lowkey   Before you can even start writing your letter you need to decide what stationary to use Notebook paper is always a safe option but itâs not the only one If you recently went on a trip with your family use a postcard from that locationOr if you have special stationary that you really love use that instead   To do this write your note on a 6â by 6â piece of paper or any squareshaped paper Fold the paper twice over so your paper is divided into four equal quadrants Fold the top point down to meet the crease in the center Fold the bottom point up so it touches the top point Fold your right side to meet the crease in the center and then do the same with the left side Flip the heart over and fold the top points down If youâre passing your note in an envelope feel free to gussy up the envelope as well You can add stickers or use stencils to write your crushâs name out If you want to be funny try cutting out your crushâs name using letters from a magazine and taping them to the envelope so it looks like a ransom note   Keep in mind that he might not like stickers as much as you do Less is usually more when it comes to decorating your note unless you want the note to look overthetop on purpose If the note is serious in tone its probably best to keep it simple just write his name in plain letters on the envelope   To make your envelope a little more colorful and fun try painting it To do this all you will need is your envelope some paint and a brush Try painting wavy lines in different colored stripesWhen painting make sure to keep your brush flat and drag it across the surface Let the envelope dry before you put your letter inside   If you frequently pass your crush in the halls plan on giving him the note during that time You wonât have too much time before you have to get to your next class so you wonât have to worry about standing around and talking awkwardly   If youâre too nervous or anxious to pass the note yourself give it to a friend to pass on Make sure you choose a friend that you trust just in case they decide to read the note themselves and tell others what it says You could also give him the note in class Heâll probably be thrilled to have something to do other than focusing on the lesson and studying of course Just make sure it doesnât fall into the wrong hands You donât want your teacher to find it and confiscate it or worse read the note out loud   If you donât want to give the note directly to your crush and you feel weird asking someone else to do it slide the note through the slots in his locker Just make sure youâre putting the note in the right locker   If you feel that you couldnât possibly give your note at school try sending it through email Some people believe that email is not romantic but thatâs actually not the caseAs long as youâre being honest and sharing your feelings your crush wonât really care how you send them over   You can also send your note as a text or Facebook message Whatever medium you feel most comfortable using do that   If youâre absolutely convinced that you couldnât possibly send your crush a letter with your name on it try leaving your name off Your crush wonât know who his secret admirer is but some people like a mystery Just know that if you want to actually pursue a relationship with your crush youâre going to have to come clean about it eventually

Most of the time if you are not happy or confident your feelings will show Look in a mirror and smile at yourself and make different faces Smile around him and be with friends so you look like you have a life outside of trying to get the attention of guys You dont have to ignore him completely but dont get obsessive either  Walk with your shoulders loosely relaxed Swing your hips but only a little otherwise it will give the guy the idea that youre trying too hard   Maybe youll get a compliment back If you dont brush it off Most likely he is not interested because for in most cases guys will look for every opportunity to compliment a girl who they are into   This will let him know that you are comfortable doing things for him and usually this starts conversations Dont become the guy in the relationship though If he is not sure enough of himself to do the same back like pick up a book you dropped in the hallway then dont try Or at least give him a year or two to man up   Make sure you laugh at his jokes just not all of them or else he might think that youre trying too hard Ask him about his interests and what he likes to do for fun   Talk to other boys and act independent and confident Boys go crazy when they like you and you flirt with other boys   If he really likes you he wont need the sexy side of you all the time Make yourself stand out but not so much that he will think youre way out of your comfort zone and trying too hard If he likes what you think is inappropriate or extremely uncomfortable to you hes not good for you   Just keep on being yourself Remember theres someone out there thats absolutely amazing and will love you for who you are and if you keep on looking you will find him
Dont stare at her for a long time but if she likes you she would be happy if you noticed her If you look at her and she looks back at you smile   If you are going to sit down sit next to her If you are standing in a room walk over to her and say Hi insert name   If you are standing outside a classroom waiting to enter go up to her and say hello or hi Ask her out and then ask her for her phone number But only if she looks like she is able to get out a piece of paper and write down her number If she likes you she would probably say yes   However make sure its just the two of you because if shes with a group of friends and she says no youll be humiliated   Talk to her but not for too long If she is in a group of friends never shake her hand first or talk to her first Talk to the group and go around Make the whole group laugh Have a friend with you so he distracts the group while you talk to the girl you like Dont talk for too long   When you leave say it was a pleasure talking to her and then leave As you are walking away look back to see if she is staring at you If she is smile with a little smile and turn around and keep going

Use the internet to look into your options to find the best movie to accommodate a good kiss session Theres plenty of apps for your smartphone that will also show you movie times near you  Try find a movie that youve both either seen or have very little interest in seeingThis can get tricky with the high price of going to the movies these days For a more enjoyable time wait until the movie you actually want to see has been playing for a month or two If you think or know she wants to see something suggest it yourself   The idea is to pick a movie that wont be too crowded Consider the duration of the movie You should decide if you think youll want a three hour movie or can settle with an hour and a half   It could be uncomfortable to smooch to a very serious movie Either go for a comedy romanticcomedy or a horrorThese movies also get less attendance than the bigger blockbusters   Be on the same page as your date One of the best ways to create chemistry is for the two of you to watch trailers together Be assertive if there is something you want to see but dont push it too hard In the end decide on something together   This will give you a chance to flirt before the movie starts Since shes already agreed to go out on a date with you you shouldnt be nervous at this part Be yourself   A great way of initiating chemistry between her and you is to play an arcade game Make eyes at her intermittently   Dont be overly competitive A little bit can be cute but if you take it too seriously it could ruin your chances   It is a nice courtesy to offer to buy popcorn and soda for you two to share If this is one of the first dates with this lady you the guy should make the offer   Pick a seat that seems to be the most remote Try somewhere in the back row or in a cornerThe ultimate idea is to pick a seat that is not too close to other movie goers   Apply a thin layer of chapstick before your date to ensure your lips arent chapped Dont be too insistent in applying chapstick throughout the date You might seem nervous or too anxious for a kiss Keep your cool   You might have purchased a 24 oz Coke but just carry mints in your pocket anyway Youll be glad to have them   It could be weird to make a move right as the title credits are playing Give it at least twenty minutes into the film The ideal scene would be a slower one during the exposition   Do not sit there and stare at your date Just glance over from time to time Keep this up until you both meet eyes and then quickly turn back to the filmYour best bet is for her and you to blush after meeting eyes   If she has her hand in plain view on the cup holder that is a good indicator that she wants you to hold it Dont go too out of your way to hold her hand Put your hand gently over her hand and wait for her hand to respond to yours   If she is leaning on the opposite side of the seat she doesnt want you to kiss her Look for her to put her hair behind her ear This exposes her neck and is a good cue that she is interested Be sly when youre gauging her mood   Turn towards her and gently touch her chin with your fingerThis is a clear straightforward signal that will tell her I want to kiss you Once she moves her head towards yours slowly start moving your head towards hers   If she doesnt acknowledge your initiation you might just have to sit through the rest of the film disappointed   If she wants to kiss again youll know it Be charming and a gentleman after the first kiss Dont be cheesy and say things like Well that was nice or Youre a good kisser   Dont just keep on kissing her until the movie is over without a break Kiss for a little bit and then go back to watching the film Wait about twenty minutes and then turn towards her again She should be on board if she enjoyed the first kiss   Guys normally make the first move so make sure you are confident If you are confident she will feel comfortable   Once the movie is over say you had a great time if you mean it Drop a suggestion that youd like to hang out again Dont ask her if she had a good time Be smooth but dont be afraid to reveal yourself
Believe it or not boys get just as shy as girls do when it comes to making the first move Smiles are friendly and welcoming â a smile can make a guy feel instantly secure about walking over and introducing himself On the other hand a frown is sure to make him nervous and keep him away This goes hand in hand with smiling You can smile all day long but unless you make eye contact when you do it it wonât signal to him that you want him to come talk to youIf you make eye contact and smile as you pass him he will notice especially if it happens often If he smiles back all the better   Eye contact is great but avoid outright staring at him Glance over occasionally but donât stare too long   This is far more important than your hair or your clothes Having confidence is not only an attractive personality trait but it also makes you a more dynamic interesting person Someone with confidence will automatically attract people Radiate positivity When a guy sees you talking to his friends it makes him feel much more comfortable about approaching you himselfJust make sure you arenât flirting with his friends Heâll notice that too but not in a good way   When youâre around a guy that you want to talk to being buried in your cell phone is definitely not a signal that you want to chat Keep your head up and look alert ready to engage   Communication is so much more than just using words â your body language also speaks volumes even from across the room or hall   Donât cross your arms It definitely sends the signal that you are not approachable Watch your posture When you slouch you communicate to a guy without saying a word that you donât feel confident enough to have him approach you Keep your gestures smooth and firm Relaxed hands imply confidence whereas clenched hands can make you seem anxious and unapproachable Try not to squirm in your outfit or fidget with anything Doing so can make you appear anxious
Brush your hair teeth shower and get dressed taking a bit more time than usual to highlight your best qualities presenting yourself with flare strength and passion  Never fake your personality just to impress someone Be gregarious kind and leave a great first impression especially on your crush with a sweet smile and glistening eyes   Although you may have trouble doing it catch their attention in class by joking around with them of course if you are not very shy Otherwise you may want to accidentally drop your pencil forward so they can pick it up or smile when they answer a question   Although you may of not made a full impression on him yet often cross paths try not to be bluntly obvious in your advancements rather smiling at them This may or may not result in being asked to the dance   You may need to become friends with your crush Smile talk laugh at his jokes no matter how boringYou just have to wait a while and hopefully by the last dance of the year youll dance and go steady   Text and email your crush by getting his number Make sure to use a winking face winks occasionally Even if you think that is too much you could always use a smiley After getting closer use xoxo to represent hugs and kisses
It sounds hard but if you just act and do things the way you normally do when youre around him he wont see any reason to act differently The main thing here is to put him at ease  Now that he knows that you like him odds are he thinks thats pretty cool At the very least hes got some extra confidence in himself and he has you to thank so youve got a great chance of becoming good friends with him and more than friends if you play your cards right So get him to talk about himself find things that the two of you can both talk about It can be anything recent movies his and your hobbies teachers and classes music etc   It puts him at ease and lets him know you enjoy being around him If you dont think you have a good looking smile practice making faces in the mirror embarrassing yes but it really works until youre confident in all your expressions Once youve got the muscle sequences down youre all set   A really good one is to while youre talking look into his eyes for a second then look away and smile and blush if you can manage it Maybe twirl or fix your hair with one hand He already knows you like him anyway so what is there to lose   A reassuring tap a playful punch anything like that will definitely make him feel more masculine and guys generally like that Â Also things like playing with your hair or licking your lips a bit are great ways to flirt But dont do things like that too often he might think you are bored or need Chapstick or something like that   Also make sure youre talking to your friends as well as him or he might think youre not very social Dont forget he might be as nervous as you are   Be you Dont change your real self just because you are with the cutest guy in living history
If you are already somewhat comfortable talking to your crush it will be easiest just to ask them where they live Keep it light and ask them in a way that isnât too obviousTry framing the question around yourself Say something like âOh I live on First Street What area of the city do you live inâ If you know they grew up in your city you can ask âWhat area of town did you grow up inâ Then follow up with âDo you still live in the same placeâ Fit it into conversation Before you ask your crush where they live start a fun conversationUse it to flirt and ask them other questions too like what kind of food and music they like This will make asking for where they live just another fun question It might help to talk to your crush over online chat or through text message If you do this youâll be less nervous about starting a conversationPlus if they tell you their address youâll have it in writing with no risk of forgetting  If any of your friends know your crush first see if they know where your crush lives   See if you know anyone thatâs attended a birthday party at your crushâs house or studied with them If none of your friends have been to your crushâs house see if they have any friends that know your crush If they do they can ask their friends for you That way your crush wonât know that youâre trying to find out where they live   If none of your friends really know your crush you might consider asking some of your crushâs friends   First pick one of their friends who seems like a nice and trustworthy person It helps if this is at least an acquaintance of yours Donât pick their best friend as this person is most likely to tell your crush that you asked where they lived Send them a quick text or message Say something like âHey I really like Jessica but Iâm too nervous to tell her yet I was just wanted to ask you where they lived Thanksâ If you can include your reason for wanting to know For example âIâd really like to be able to mail her a cardâ Ask the person not to tell your crush that you asked
Have your crush notice you and if he doesnt notice youthen try to make him notice you Give a good first impression say hello in the hallways maybe walk with him to class and talk a little Form a little bubble in his mind about you  Sometimes boys can be confusing and some times they can be sad If you see your crush down and by himself or just on a wall looking sad go up to him and ask Are you okay Let him know that youre always there for him if he wants to talk and that he can trust you Remember to Give him some space once in a while or if he looks like he wants to be alone This will make him miss your comfort and hell think about you   To make a boy notice you you have to sometimes act in a way that hints you want to be noticed more If you find him looking at you make eye contact with him and give him a sweet innocent closed mouth smile Hold the eye contact for about five seconds then break off This will leave your crush wondering about your seductive smile   Guys will be guys and a little bit of flirting wont do you any harm Its okay to flirt a little bit leave your crush with a memory of a beautiful girl that has shown some interest in him He will come back to return the favor sometime and voila conversations will start rolling   Leave the girl talk to your friends Usually one way to get a guy to notice you more is to talk about him Ask him about his game if he plays a sport or an art piece if hes into art or whatever you find he has hobbies in Your crush will most certainly be flattered responsive and maybe even a tad bit embarrassed if hes shy when you ask about his day He might ask about you a bit too   A friend is always there but if you want your crush to notice you more then youve got to be unavailable once in a while Break off a conversation nicely and excuse yourself off or talk to another guy Have him wondering about the mysterious side of you   If he says looks then ask him why and say its all about the personality not looks Also keep on giving him hints about you
The goal is to divert their attention to anything else other than your crush Get your friends talking about what theyâre up to or the things that theyâre interested in   Make the conversation less about you and more about them Ask questions about their day any plans they may have for the weekend or about the latest movie they watched Be excited about what they are saying in order to encourage them to keep talking more about them and less about you and your crush Encourage your friends to open up Ask them about the love interest in their life or if they have their eye on someone Your interest can make them feel comfortable with expressing themselves about whats going on in their lives   If your friends insist on bringing up your crush you dont have to talk about the person if you dont want to When it seems like theyre about to start teasing you try one of these approaches   Tell your friends I dont want to talk about that right now Shrug then turn it around and bring up one of their boyfriendsgirlfriends Act like you didnt hear what they said and change the subject entirely   If unwanted teasing starts happening transition into in a more welcoming conversation If theres something you have in common that you could both talk about happily for hours jump straight to that instead of lingering on the subject of your crush   For example if your friend is a huge sports fan bring up their favorite playerteam or recap last nightâs sports highlights Friendly banter about whose playerteam is the best can help switch the conversation gears to more pleasant conversation
Talk to the boy you like and figure out some details about his personality Be careful not to sound as if you are trying to gain information Instead try to be interested and join in    Does he like frat boy humour or does he enjoy a drier wit This will be easy to discover as you spend more time with him and get to know what his favourite TV shows or movies are Having a night at his or your house is the perfect way to do this Once you get a feel for his sense of humour cracking a joke or preparing a witty comeback should be met with a hearty chuckle Dont do this too often or it will start to look a bit weird If he likes mean jokes then you can do some but be careful not to hurt others feelings     Nothing lights up a persons eyes more than a conversation about their favourite interests or hobbies A few of these should get you going Though you may not know much about cars entering a conversation with him about it and showing a genuine interest in it will surely bring a smile to his face This is perfect and even if you get bored let him stop the conversation rather than yourself   Laugh at his corny jokes Compliment him on his new shirt Making him feel good about himself will be one of many reasons hell want you around and often Be careful not to do this too often as some men might grow tired of constantly being complimented   Make him feel like you enjoy his company and he will begin to enjoy yours   Lightly touching his arm during conversation or holding his hand is a way to express your interest   Letting him know that you trust him and have feelings for him gives him an opportunity to reciprocate those feelings   This tells him that you are thinking about him   When he talks be active in the conversation Show that you care about what hes telling you   You have nothing to lose Smiling at a boy is the best way to show your interest and you can tell pretty quickly if he is also interested
Your boyfriend chose to be with you for many reasons Donât let your philandering friend get in your head and make you forget that Showing you are confident in yourself may make them back off It will also show your boyfriend that you know that you are a catch and that heâs crazy if he lets your friend get between the two of you   Tell yourself just how smart kind attractive and funny you are if you ever get down on yourself because of this situation  Laying on a few subtle and not so subtle hints to your friend reaffirms to them that he is yours Doing so may also make them feel guilty about their plans and help them decide to back off   For instance if your friend asks if your boyfriend is joining when the two of you make plans you could say in a joking manner âWhy Am I not fun enough for youâ This lets the friend now that you are aware of their constant desire to be around your boyfriend You could also make your friend know to back off by showing affection to your boyfriend particularly if they are flirting with him right in front of you You could smile at your friend and then plant a kiss on your manâs cheek This will definitely send the friend a message Walk up to the conversation with a smile on your face if your friend and boyfriend are having a talk You could place your hand on your boyfriendâs back and say âWhat are we talking aboutâ Acting in this way shows your boyfriend and friend that you expect to be a part of this conversationYou may want to be concerned if they stop talking or they move their bodies away from you   Bring the attention towards your relationship if you find your friend and boyfriend having a talk You can use subtle tricks to remind your friend that you and your boyfriend are a couple   For instance remember to say âweâ a lot when talking Instead of saying something like âI really like that restaurant say âWe really like that restaurantâ Talking about what you do together can remind your friend that you and your boyfriend are united
Healthy selfconfidence is great but theres a difference between being confident and being cocky If you think this guy seems a little too confident in his efforts to win you over it could be because hes had plenty of practice   Most people become at least a little nervous around people theyre attracted to A confident guy isnt necessarily a player but if he doesnt break a sweat while asking you out or seems rather aloof about the whole deal he might not be that serious about you  If the man is old enough to be your father it could be a bad sign Older players who are set in their ways frequently target younger less experienced women who are easier to trick   Not every older man is a player of course but if theres a huge age gap and he exhibits other signs of being a player that age gap may work against him Similarly not every player is an older man There are plenty of young players out in the world too   When hes texting someone lean in his direction and peek at his phone You dont even need to see the screen in fact youll learn more by keeping your eyes on him If the guys a player hell probably yank his phone away faster than you can blink   Moreover if hes always on his phone or looks at it more than he looks at you that could be another bad sign This piece of advice isnt an invitation to swipe his phone and look at his call log though Many people view that as an invasion of privacy and even guys who arent players might get upset at the breach of trust You usually wont need his text or call history as evidence anyway since being overprotective of his phone is a bad enough sign on its own   If he still visits the same spots he went to when he was single and picking up women theres a good chance that hes still in the habit of charming the ladies there   This does not mean that you should stalk him A healthier way to find out where hes going is ask around and find out who mightve seen him and where he was when it happened You could also try visiting the spot you met him on an evening he might be there   Honest compliments are sweet but you probably shouldnt trust someone whos quick to flatter you to an excessive degree Players often rely on this sort of âsweet talkâ to win over women   Pay attention to the types of compliments he gives you If theyre general overused compliments that could apply to nearly any womanâbeautiful hair gorgeous smile etcâit could be a sign that he isnt putting much thought into who you are and what makes you special You should also be cautious around men who specifically compliment your insecurities Similarly most players are quick to address you with one or more pet names like âhoneyâ âsugarâ and âbabyâ Pet names that develop after an extended relationship are usually okay but be wary around guys who use pet names from day one   Players are also liars Catching him in the middle of a lie can be difficult but when you do you shouldnt shrug it off This is especially true if hes lied to you more than once   Lies about his past where he spent time recently or who hes been with are some of the most common ones to watch out for If youre suspicious about something and confront him about it watch his reaction Players will generally try to laugh it off and change the topic When that doesnt work they may admit to the truth but somehow blame you for their lie   Most players are egotistical so theyll start talking about themselves before you even have the chance to ask If a guy hasnt shared much about his own life though ask him about it and watch for inconsistencies   Everyone wants to look good in front of someone theyre attracted to but the player will usually look a little too good If his life story seems scripted and too good to be true it probably is Pay attention to the details If some of the details dont match up it could be an indication that hes lying about who he is   Since most players are overly concerned with themselves they dont have much time to be concerned with other people A guy who is genuinely interested in you will want to know about your life and your passions but a player wont take the time to find out   Skilled players may know well enough to ask about your life but wont be interested enough to remember what you say Bring up things youve talked about in past conversations Its probably fine if he occasionally forgets about small details but its usually a bad sign if he makes a habit of forgetting   Ask about his past relationships and talk about yours These conversations provide the player with opportunities to manipulate your feelings   He may ask about your past relationships and fixate on the insecurities you felt during those times By knowing what makes you insecure he can figure out how to work that to his advantage When talking about his own past relationships he may leave out many of the details but stress that hes been hurt in the past A quick mention of past hurts may not be bad but if he plays it up to evoke pity from you it may be another manipulation tactic   Players will often accuse the women theyre seeing of cheating on them Usually this is done in an attempt to steer the attention away from their own guilt and their own cheating ways   Pay attention to how the guy asks you out and how he responds when you invite him Good guys will value your time but a player wont   Players usually ask you out on short notice Since they arent genuinely looking forward to seeing you they turn you into a backup plan and ask you out only when they dont have anything âbetterâ lined up for an evening If you always get a âmaybeâ from the guy when you ask him out it could mean that he doesnt want to commit in case another more preferable offer comes up A man who frequently cancels lastminute might do so for similar reasons   Players are inconsistent in their affections and may sway from one extreme to the other You may not hear from him in weeks and then suddenly hell start bombarding you with more attention than you can handle   During âcoldâ periods theres a good chance that hes spending his time with other women and is too busy with them to bother with you During his âhotâ periods hes either lost his other options or lost interest in them As a result he returns to you in an effort to fill the void   If the two of you always meet at night try asking him for a daytime date Most players will strongly resist and reject the idea and the excuses they give for doing so are usually pretty lame   If you cant change the time of the date try changing the nature of it Instead of spending time alone or going out for drinks go somewhere with plenty of people and very little alcohol The guys odds of getting you into bed will decrease when you do this so if hes a player he wont be willing to make the change   Try to maintain eye contact when youre together in a public venue Your eyes dont need to be locked the entire time but his eyes should be directed your way for most of the date   Note that the occasional wandering eye may not be a terrible sign but if his eyes are constantly wandering toward other people theres a problem Similarly a wandering eye that remains stuck on another woman is also a bad sign   A player only cares about your bodyâand more precisely whether or not he gets to enjoy it One of the best ways to weed out the players is to take things slow with every guy you meet Players wont have the patience to stick around   If youre in a relationship with a player youre probably not the only woman hes seeing Making your relationship public will make it easier for his lies to be exposed to both you and the other women and for that reason hell usually reject the idea of being public about it   The way he treats you in public will be one good indication If he refuses to treat you with any special affection or treats you just as affectionately as other women it might be his way of keeping your relationship a secret To that end he might also avoid spending time with you in certain places if he thinks theres a better chance of being caught there Check social media accounts too If he refuses to be âfriendsâ or âfollowersâ with you or if he never responds to any public comments you make toward him it could be a sign that hes trying to hide your relationship Refusing to update his ârelationship statusâ might be another social media clue   Most players wont want you anywhere near their friends and it wont be because theyre afraid of another man stealing you away   If he lets you meet his friends he takes the risk that someone within the group will slip and reveal information about his true self If you do meet his friends watch his behavior around them Some players will drop their guard and show their true colors when theyre hanging around their buddies   Invite him to meet your friends and family Since a player isnt serious about you he will usually refuse such offers or make excuses to get out of them at the last minute   Moreover friends and relatives with a keen eye might be able to spot a player when they see one A player who agrees to meet your loved ones would have to take the risk of being discovered by someone like that   Ask around about the guy and find out if there are any rumors about him People in his own social circle might cover for him but anyone who isnt attached to him wont have a need to do so   Ask your close friends to do their own investigating on your behalf as well They probably have a few connections you dont have and one of those connections might have helpful information You could even consider talking with the guys exgirlfriends but do so with caution Some exes will intentionally paint a bad picture as an act of revenge Additionally an exgirlfriend who believes that you âstoleâ the guy away from her may take out her negative feelings on you   Players lack respect for you but thats because they lack respect for everyone It can be difficult to tell when a guy is disrespecting you but itll probably be easier to detect disrespect he shows toward others   Pay particular attention to the way he treats and talks about other women Even disrespect he shows toward female relatives can indicate an overall sense of disrespect toward women in general Watch how he treats workers at the places you visit too Players may relish in the authority they have over these staff members
Use any available sources Also decide whether you want to research any kind of wolf or just a specific breed like a timber wolf or an Arctic wolf  A wolfs main prey is ungulates such as moose deer elk etc and things like musk oxen and bison They are opportunistic feeders though and will sometimes eat smaller prey plant buds berries etc   Wolves are normally social animals with strong bonds courage and loyalty although they are afraid of humans They are not the bloodthirsty killer many think them to be They do not kill without reason if a wolf attack seems unprovoked assume there are reasons only the wolf knew  such as the human was on its territory   Every wolf is different too so some are submissive and others more dominant Its just like with dogs the temperament varies depending on the individual animal   A wolf is born blind and deaf but with a strong sense of smell and the ability to crawl around in a pack usually made up of two wolves and their other offspring   As they grow their eyes open and turn blue Their eyes turn yellow orange or amber or in rare cases turn green or stay blue when they get older When they are puppies they will drink their mothers milk as newborns then be weaned off of it to eat meat When they are first weaned off of it they will eat half digested meat the adult pack members regurgitate Then they move onto actual raw meat For a few weeks the puppies play fight until they determine who is more dominant than the other however adult wolves still play with each other To invite another wolf to play a wolf will use the same play bow motion as your average dog They may also make dancing movements which are also used in courtship Once they get older the pups will begin to follow the adults on a hunt but not join in hunting Then later they will join pack hunts The ways a wolf pack hunts can vary One method is to have several wolves chase the prey to where other wolves are hiding Another method is to surround the prey and then close in on it until it notices the wolves then charge at it When the prey falls before eating it a wolf will do something called a jaw punch to ensure the prey is dead It does this by walking towards the carcass nudging it and jumping back If the prey doesnt move the wolves eat The two parent wolves eat first Some younger wolves may try to interrupt but if they do they are snarled and barked and and have to wait their turn After a meal is over a wolf pack will cache the leftovers where they may return to eat them later Also a wolf pack will engage in group howling both before and after a hunt Wolves do not actually howl at the moon but they do howl on lighter nights since those are better nights to hunt on When landing after jumping their toes splay for balance and grip They also have two methods of grooming themselves licking themselves and nibbling the fur between their toes There is much more about wolf behavior though it doesnt end there   Wolves unlike dogs bark rarely They will however emit a soft bark or low woof sound to alert other pack members of danger sometimes They will growl and snarl with the hackles raised fur bristled lips curled and body tense to show aggression They curl their tails between their legs with flattened fur and ears to show fear Also they will lower their ears and narrow their eyes to show suspicion and a head tilt for confusion They have submission exactly like that of a dog there is either active submission where they roll over curl their tail between their legs flatten their fur and ears whimper a lot and avoid eye contact or passive submission where they curl their tail between their legs and lower their body very close to the ground If a wolf ruffles its fur stares at another wolf raises its tail and possibly growls it is showing dominance Just like dogs wolves sniff each others rumps to gather information They do it in the same position too In courtship a male wolf will hug a female wolfs neck the two will dance around each other and put their muzzle on each others muzzle and lick and nuzzle a lot Theyll also sleep side by side and walk side by side bumping their bodies against each other Then when the time finally comes wolves mate in winter since young elk are born in spring and so are their pups the female approaches the male and tries to be very playful while the male stands still Also a puppy will lick nudge or nuzzle an adults muzzle to ask for food Research their anatomy especially if you want to draw a realistic one Wolves have feathery shoulder fur a blocky muzzle and blocky paws clumpy belly fur rough leg fur fluffy tails rounded triangle shaped ears circular eyes and dull claws They usually have a pelt of black brown orangeish color grey or white White is either an Arctic wolf or a very old timber wolf   Try going to a place where they have captive wolves like Wolf Haven International Some captive wolves are fed berries and bits of cheese and taught tricks Remember though captive wolves behavior is very different from wild wolves This is part of the reason that terms like Alpha Beta and Omega were debunked   If you feel you dont have enough to be considered an expert do a lot more research
Do you know for sure that the guy doesnât like you back Try giving him subtle cues that you like him If heâs giving you mixed signals in return donât take it personally Middle school age can be confusing for everyoneThe guy may be shy Even if he acts confident around certain girls it may be because he feels comfortable around them as friends For example wait for the right moment than give him a compliment like âYouâre a great listenerâ Try sending him a text with a cute nickname that lets him know youâre thinking about him and his interests Say something like âHey hun How did your baseball game goâ  Itâs possible that this guy doesnât even know that you like him If youâre not sure whether he knows you may want to tell him that you like being around him Use the term âlikeâ not âloveâTry saying âI like studying with youâ If you want to be even more direct try sayingâI like being around youâ   Whether he is in your group of friends or is your best friend if you really think you will be able to outgrow and move past crushing on this guy you could always try to stay friends This will be even easier to do if you work through your crush just between you and the guy without getting mutual friends involved That way if he doesnât like you back you can continue hanging out without it feeling as awkwardIf you donât feel that you can remain friends you can tell him the truth but donât be angry or act like he did something wrong Try saying âItâs just difficult for me to hang out with you because I had a crush on you you know Itâs not because of you â youâre a great guyâ If you donât want to tell him directly that itâs too painful to remain friends you can ease yourself out of his life gradually by making yourself less available For example you may be too busy with studying afterschool activities or family obligations to meet up   If your crush doesnât seem to want to talk or is acting like he feels uncomfortable it is best to distance yourself You may also want to back off if it feels too difficult for you to be friends It may be hard to do if you share the same classes but try to avoid your crush during social times like lunch and recessStop visiting your crushâs social media pages Unfollow them or change your settings so that you donât see their posts Itâs painful but you have to respect his feelings You donât want to make him uncomfortable â even friends shouldnât do that to each other If you do things to try and make him like you back then you arenât being yourself People should like you for who you already areDonât change your look or the way you act to get someone elseâs attention Guys who like you will notice you on their own   When you have to be around this guy keep a cool head Instead of focusing on him and what heâs doing tell yourself positive affirmations about yourself in your head Ignore him Think about how much you are improving be positive and choose not to suffer   For example think to yourself âI feel confident and secure I accept and love myselfâ   Donât keep trying to text or talk to the guy A crush shouldnât take you away from doing other life activitiesIf you are spending a ton of time thinking about your crush and you canât stop yourself you should talk to a parent or guidance counselor to get help dealing with those feelings
When it comes to making a beekeeping suit the shirt is the trickiest part Its helpful to have a shirt that opens in the front so you can fasten it securely around your veil but you will need to alter it so bees cant crawl into the holes between the buttons Look for a shirt with the following qualitiesThe fabric is thick look for a heavy cotton or denim The color is white or another very light color Bees feel threatened by darker colors which remind them of bears The fit is loose Choose a size or two larger than what you normally wear rather than getting a shirt thats skin tight That way if a bee inserts its stinger into the fabric it wont be right against your skin  Youll need to make a few alterations along the collar sleeves and opening in order to create a tight seal that will keep bees from crawling in It helps to have a sewing machine but if you dont have one you can certainly make the alterations by hand Heres what you needA roll of oneinch wide white velcro Stickon velcro works fine or you can get the type that doesnt have adhesive backing You need enough to line the shirt opening the collar and the sleeve openings so you may want to take measurements before purchasing velcro A needle and white thread or a sewing machine if you have one A measuring tape and scissors   Use a small pair of scissors to snip off all the buttons Take care to snip the threads just underneath the buttons without cutting a hole in the shirt Snip the buttons from the opening of the shirt the collar and the sleeve openings Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread Insert the needle from inside the shirt near the edge of a buttonhole Stitch the buttonhole tightly closed then finish it off by tying another tight knot Repeat until youve sewn every buttonhole closed including those around the collar and sleeve openings   You might want to doublethread the needle if youre working with thin or weak thread Neat invisible stitching is not the goal just make sure the buttonholes are tightly closed and wont pop open when youre handling bees   Measure the length of the shirt opening Place the measuring tape along the edge of the shirts opening Measure the length of the opening from the tip of the shirttail to the bottom of the collar Write down the measurement then use it to cut two pieces of velcro that will stretch the entire length of the shirt opening on both sides   Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces Sew a piece of velcro over the length of the opening where you cut off the buttons Sew another piece of velcro along the underside of the opening where you sewed up the buttonholes The two pieces of velcro should seal firmly together when you close the shirt   If you have a sewing machine you can quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle If youre sewing by hand make tight neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while youre wearing your bee suit   Use the measuring tape to measure around the collar Cut a length of velcro according to your measurement and sew it around the inside of the collar Cut a second length and sew it around the outside of the collar This will allow you to adjust the collar to make it tight enough to keep bees out Use the same method to add velcro to the sleeve openings   Again a sewing machine makes it easy to quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place Stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down You can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle If youre sewing by hand make tight neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while youre wearing your bee suit   A cowboystyle hat with a wide brim makes the perfect base for your beekeeping hat It will keep the veil from touching your face as you work making it easier to see and less likely that a bee will get close enough to your skin to sting Look for a hat with these qualitiesThe fabric is thick enough to keep out bees but thin enough to pierce with a sewing needle Felt and tightlywoven straw hats work well leather can be too thick The hat is lightweight enough that you wont overheat Youll be doing most of your beekeeping in the summer so keep that in mind when you choose your hate The brim is stiff not floppy It should be firm enough to keep the veil several inches from your face   You can use stiff nylon mesh tulle or wire mesh to make the veil You need enough veil fabric to fit around the brim of the hat and fall at least five inches below your shoulders One yard should be sufficient   Be sure to use a clear or white fabric so that youll be able to see through it easily If you find a thin tulle you want to use you may need a double layer to make sure your veil keeps the bees away   Measure around the brim of the hat then cut your fabric about an inch wider Youll need a bit of overlap to make sure the bees cant get through the seam Make sure the fabric is long enough to drape down five inches below your shoulders   Overlap the edges by half an inch Stitch the edges closed to create a large tube of fabric with the same circumference as your hats brim Make sure the tube is sturdy enough to keep out bees before moving to the next step It doesnt hurt to add an extra row of stitches along the seam   Working by hand carefully sew the top edge of the veil around the brim of the hat If you are handsewing be sure to use small whipstitches to keep all openings too small for the bees to enter and get underneath the mesh Continue until the veil is tightly secured to the hat   Your beetight shirt and hat are the most important parts but in order for your suit to work youll need a few more items Remember that everything should be white or light in colorThick white sweatpants or work pants Make sure they have tight elastic around the waist and ankles You can also wear white workout pants if sweatpants are too hot Tall socks Thick gloves Dishwashing gloves work just fine Some beekeepers prefer to be barehanded Sturdy work boots Look for boots that are ankle or calf length and made of leather or other durable material There should be enough room around the opening of the boot so you can tuck the bottom of the pants into them   Set the hat on your head and drape the veil down over your shoulders bunching it around your neck Pull up the gloves so that they cover your hands and wrists   Put it on so that the end of the veil is tucked under the shirt Secure the shirt opening by pressing the velcro closed Secure the velcro around the collar and sleeve openings Check to make sure there are no gaps   Make sure the elastic on your pants is tight around the bottom of your shirt   Pull the elastic at the bottom of your pants over your socks Put on your shoes and tuck the bottom of your pants into your shoes before tying them You are now ready to handle bees   This option is more expensive than making a suit out of a shirt and pants but some find it easier to have a onepiece suit make sure the coverall you purchase is white or light in color   Dark colors can aggravate bees since these colors remind them of their predators like bears and skunks Make sure the coverall fits loosely in order to keep the material from directly contacting the skin This helps to avoid stingers that might pierce the fabric   Measure elastic to fit the neck hole and wrists then cut the elastic to the correct measurements Sew the elastic pieces around neck opening and wrist openings   This is important to prevent bees from gaining access to the inside of the coverall Dont make the elastic too tight but it should be tight enough to offer protection from bees   When putting on the beekeepers suit put the hat on first then the coveralls Make sure the mesh of the hat is securely tucked in at the neck of the coveralls Add gloves socks and boots to the ensemble

The key to flirting and conversing with your crush is confidence Your crush canât see how incredible you are unless you truly believe that you are awesome You donât need to strive to be perfect the most beautiful the coolest the smartest or the funniest person in roomâjust be the best version of yourself   Instead of criticizing your appearance identify your best attributes Write them down and repeat these positive qualities to yourself whenever you feel insecure When you look in the mirror you will start to notice your favorite features instead of focusing on your least favorite features Make a second list of your best characteristics Are you a great friend a hard worker an awesome teacher or a talented musician Do you show compassion and kindness to everyone are you willing to give others second chances or do you have the ability to make unbiased decisions Your best characteristics are some of your most attractive qualities It is difficult to accept compliments when you lack confidence You may struggle to accept that someone thinks youâre attractive or talented Instead of thanking them you might say âIâm really not ____â or âThanks but Iâm not that_____â Give your selfconfidence a boost by accepting these positive comments   When you start receiving compliments from others you will start believing that their comments are true Instead of saying âThanks but ____â simply say âThanksâ and smile As you grow more comfortable and confident you can expand your reply It is way easier to make the excuse âI have nothing to sayâ than it is to actually talk to a crush This excuse however is not valid You donât need to have an arsenal full of bizarre facts funny anecdotes insightful comments and probing questions to talk to someone Instead you just need to be genuinely interested in what your crush has to say and have a few stock questions in your quiver to jumpstart the conversation These questions may include   âWhat have you been up toâ âHave you seen the latest episode of _____â âWhat did you think of the testâ âDo you know when the English assignment is dueâ âAre you going to the game tomorrowâ Our fear of rejection is often crippling and debilitating This fear often prevents us from taking risks like talking to our crush Instead of allowing the fear of the unknown to control your love life step out of your comfort zone and talk to your crush   Donât assume that if your crush really wanted to talk to you they would start a conversation with you Your crush may be feeling as insecure shy and unsure as you Instead of waiting for your crush to make the first move take charge and talk to your crush with confidence If it turns out that your crush isnât interested in you at least youâll never spend time wondering about what could have been When you talk to your crush you want to present the best version of yourself Speak with confidence keep your emotions in check and act appropriately   Avoid gossiping about others Try to control your nervous ticks like biting your nails or twirling your hair Donât act pushyâif your crush isnât interested in you move on Avoid making offensive comments Do not tell lies about yourself
Although Capuchins do make some vocalizations they communicate largely through their body language Learning their body language can be a great way to understand what your monkey is saying allowing you to work with them to meet their needs Looking for signs of distress can help avoid any serious issues such as an attack or aggression Smiling is not a sign of happiness Monkeys smile or show their teeth when they are scared Jumping up and down or banging objects together can be a show of strength and intimidation Your monkey will likely have its own methods of expressing itself using body language You will need to pay careful attention and learn what your monkey is trying to tell you  While body language is the main method that your Capuchin will use to communicate your monkey will also use vocalizations Learning what these vocalizations mean can help you to understand and work with your monkey to keep them happy and manage their behaviorLoud screams can indicate a bad mood A kind of purring is used when Capuchins meet and are comfortable with each other Your monkey may seek to make contact with you if you are out of sight with a âikâ or âfuehâ sound If your monkey feels alarmed they may make an ika or itschgk sound A sharp whistling can also indicate your monkey feels threatened Your monkey may make sounds that are unique You will need to pay careful attention to what your monkey might be trying to say when making noises   Although Capuchins are highly intelligent they lack impulse control and can also become upset or scared easily Learning the common causes of inappropriate behavior in your Capuchin can help you and your monkey avoid these situations and improve your relationship Review some of the most common triggers for poor or dangerous behavior when working with a Capuchin monkeySocial status Your monkey may feel insecure in their social standing or try to challenge your rank as âalphaâ Territory Capuchins may claim items or spaces as their own and will defend them Fear Monkeys can easily become frightened by loud noises or fast movements Unfulfilled life Monkeys need a large amount of space and lots of social interaction to be happy   Although you may offer your monkey a good home excellent care and training they may still never behave as you want them to Each monkey will have its own personality and it is impossible to predict or fully control the behavior of your monkeyYou may need to build a permanent large shelter or cage for a monkey that is unsafe to be around As monkeys age their behavior will also change This is most obvious during puberty While you can provide a great environment and care for your monkey this is no guarantee that they will be safe to be around   If you monkey is acting aggressive or fearful you should not demonstrate any fear yourself If you show fear to your monkey it may cause them to get even more aggressive and agitated Remain calm and resist any feelings of fear or discomfort that can result from your Capuchins behaviorAlways move slowly and confidently If bitten or scratched try to remain calm Never react with quick or jerky movements even if your monkey is acting aggressively towards you   If your monkey is behaving in a way that is dangerous or unacceptable you must work quickly to let them know that you dont approve of that behavior The best way to let your monkey know that you are in charge is to issue a stern command that they stop any aggressive behaviorIssuing a simple command such as âNoâ or âStopâ is enough Say your command quickly and clearly speaking loudly without screaming the command   If you monkey is unable to calm down or is not responding to your verbal commands its time to put them in a time out Placing them in their cage will keep both of you safe and can also help send a message that their behavior was unacceptable Give your monkey a time out to manage poor or dangerous behaviorPlace your monkey back in their cage if they are misbehaving A time out will allow your monkey time to calm down or escape whatever was making them nervous or aggressive A cage for your monkey should be around 7x7x4 to provide plenty of space for them   Hitting or violently handling your Capuchin in an effort to get them to stop aggressive behavior will only destroy trust between you both Your monkey will come to view you as a threat instead of a friend and may still continue to act in a dangerous fashion regardless Use only verbal commands or temporary separation to train your monkey and maintain trustOther options such as surgically removing the finger tips or canine teeth will not calm your monkey down or build trust Hitting your monkey will only cause it to become more aggressive or fearful Shock collars confinement in a small cage or other restraint wont help with behavioral issues   With proper care and a good home your Capuchin monkey can live for up to 45 years During this time your monkey will require constant care and attention

monkey will require a great deal of care and attention Getting a Capuchin monkey as a pet will be a long term commitment   Capuchin monkeys are social and intelligent animals In the wild they normally live with a group of other monkeys and enjoy a complex social life You will need to provide as much social interaction as possible for your monkey in order to give them a happy and fulfilling life in your careYoung monkeys will need almost constant contact with you As monkeys age they will require less contact However you will still not be able to leave them alone for more than eight hours a day   It was once thought that pet monkeys needed to be given a simple pellet based diet Today it is understood that monkeys diets should be as varied and nutritious as our own Try to feed you monkey a balanced and nutritious diet to keep them happy and healthyFruits such as mangos pineapples apples pears and grapes can be great parts of your monkeys diet Carrots cucumbers and sweet corn are examples of some vegetables you can include in your monkeys diet Boiled poultry and fish can be good sources of protein for your monkey Trying to recreate the natural act of food scavenging can be a

Fruit is a great source of vitamins for your guinea pig However while your guinea pig might enjoy fruit you should only use it as a snack or a treat As a result you donât need to buy nearly as much fruit as vegetables And for many people fruit you have around the house already may be used When shopping for fresh fruit consider   Apples Blueberries Oranges Pears Peaches  Unlike fruit you can feed your guinea pig large amounts of vegetables every week When buying vegetables consider   Carrots Green peppers Radish tops Cucumbers Brussel sprouts Pelleted foods are a mix of hay vitamins and other food sources that serve as a staple in your guinea pigâs diet They are much healthier for your guinea pigs than other types of food because they are not dyed with artificial colors and flavors   Focus only on cornfree and seedfree pellets Pellets enriched with vitamins are okay While your guinea pig will be getting some hay in his or her pellets fresh hay is an important element of a guinea pigâs diet and overall health This is because guinea pigs need hay in order to keep their teeth from overgrowing In addition hay keeps their digestive system clean   Be aware that a lot of hay sold at large chain stores is not high quality hay Try to buy fresh hay at pet stores or at farm supply stores Timothy hay is perfect for adult guinea pigs Baby and pregnant guinea pigs will need alfalfa hay which has a higher vitamin and mineral content in it At the start of every day you should put out fresh vegetables for your guinea pig And since vegetables are an important part of your guinea pigâs diet you need to make sure that he or she has plenty of vegetables throughout the day   Feed your guinea pig about one cup of vegetables for every two pounds he or she weighs Break your vegetable servings up into at least two This way your guinea pig will have fresh and unwilted vegetables throughout the day Whenever you provide new vegetables remove any old uneaten or spoiled vegetables from the previous serving While fruit is important and can provide your guinea pig with badly needed vitamins you need to limit his or her consumption of it Fruit should be served to your guinea pig as a treat not as a main course   Limit fruit treats to once or twice a week Try to only feed your guinea pig one or two tablespoons of fruit for every two pounds that your guinea pig weighs Only provide fresh and washed fruit to your guinea pig Providing fresh hay throughout the day and week is extremely important for your guinea pigâs health Since hay can accumulate bacteria guinea pig waste youâll want to remove old hay periodically and replace it with fresh hay   Donât be afraid of giving your guinea pig too much hay More is always better than less Make sure your hay has not been sitting around the house too long At around the same time you serve your guinea pig vegetables you should also serve fresh pellets This is important as pellets are the foundation of your guinea pigâs diet   Provide 14th to 18th cup of pellets per day Amount fed will vary based on size and age of the guinea pig Feel free to divide pellets up into 2 or 3 servings if your guinea pig tends to overeat or eat it all at once Serve the pellets in a ceramic bowl You also need to make sure that your guinea pig has plenty of fresh water Fresh water is essential to your guinea pigâs diet and will help with digestion of hay pellets and the other food you provide As a result monitor water closely   Consider using a plastic drip bottle Provide a water bowl too Check your guinea pigâs water at least once a day Change and clean your guinea pigâs water bowel and drip bottle a couple times a week   Guinea pigs of different ages have different dietary needs As a result when thinking about and formulating a wellbalanced diet for your guinea pig you need to think about their age   If you adopted your guinea pig as a baby then you should have an accurate idea of his or her age If you donât know your guinea pigâs age consult a veterinarian or someone with specialized knowledge When establishing your guinea pigâs age you donât need to be exact Just be able to classify your guinea pig in one of several stages of life including baby youth adult or senior Depending on sex your guinea pigâs dietary needs will vary Sex is also important when determining your guinea pigâs age While for the most part male and female guinea pigs require the same nutrition there are a couple things you should consider   If your guinea pig is pregnant youâll need to alter her food mix If you are trying to breed your guinea pig you should probably alter the breeding pigâs diets to increase their vitamin intake Your guinea pig might have special individual needs that will impact his or her dietary needs As a result you need to consider any special or unique factors that could influence your guinea pigâs health or diet   Does your guinea pig have any chronic medical problems Does your guinea pig have any disorders or other unique factors that might impact his or her dietary needs

Hanging around your crush can make you look creepy if he or she gives obvious signals theyâre not interested Examples of signs that convey lack of interest are delayed responses failure to make eye contact and crossed arms Staring can seem aggressive and predatory and make your crush feel scared or uncomfortable in your presence Try to casually glance over at your crush from time to time or admire him or her using your peripheral vision   Try smiling or winking when you do make eye contact with your crush These are common ways to flirt with your crush from afar using eye contact   Facing your eyes torso and feet toward a person can make him or her feel cornered and uncomfortable especially when the interest isnât mutual Instead face your body in a slightly different direction so your full attention isnât centered on your crush Constantly frowning and maintaining a serious expression can make you appear too intense and creepy while smiling and laughing are more effective at lighting up the mood and making your interaction seem more friendly and casual Hanging around your crush at every possible moment can make you appear needy clingy and creepy as a result especially if youâve just met Instead say hello to your crush when you cross paths or make definitive plans to spend time together   While itâs important to be honest and upfront about your feelings toward your crush to prevent misunderstanding sometimes being overly direct can scare him or her away depending on how you present your feelings For example inform your crush that youâre interested in getting to know them better rather than professing your love and intentions to marry and bear their children   Feelings of nervousness and fear around your crush can lead to trembling sweating a shaky voice and other signs that could make your crush feel awkward and uncomfortable in your presencePractice deep breathing smile and laugh to help yourself stay calm when spending time with your crush   While you may constantly look for opportunities to make physical contact with your crush touching him or her at the wrong moments or too soon after meeting can make you seem creepy and predatory Try to maintain a respectable physical distance and avoid seizing moments to touch your crush whenever given the chance   This is helpful if he or she misinterprets your intentions and avoids spending time around you as a result For example apologize for staring at your crush and explain that you allowed your gaze to linger because he or she looked especially attractive on that particular day Poor hygiene illfitting clothes and clothing with derogatory logos and sayings are examples of things that could make you seem insensitive scary and creepy from a physical standpoint   Improve physical hygiene if necessary and avoid wearing clothing that offends your crush For example if your crush openly announces his or her distaste for gun laws avoid wearing tshirts that advertise your views on progun laws   Showing up at your crushâs favorite hangouts or place of work can seem creepy especially if you run into him or her repeatedly on more than one occasion Keep a fair distance and avoid going out of your way to run into them during staged meetings
If theres no question that your guy friend is suddenly getting butterflies in his stomach every time he sees you its time to let him know you dont feel the same way before things get out of control But if you want to deliver the news in the best way possible you have to pick the right time and place so hes comfortable and receptive although you dont want it to seem like a date   Pick a place that is not romantic If you tell him the news at a nice restaurant or while the sun is setting on the beach hell be thrown off guard Tell him at a place where you would never go on a date Tell him in the morning or during the day The nighttime is more romantic Pick a place where youll be relatively alone and away from his friends You dont want him to be embarrassed if other people hear you deliver the bad news Pick a time when hes not likely to be busy or stressedout Dont tell him the night before a big exam or when he has an incredibly busy day at work Dont dawdle Once you know he likes you dont wait too long for the perfect moment to say something The longer he doesnt know how you feel the more hurt hell be  If you want to tell him in the most effective way possible then you should prepare what youll say in advance If you dont know exactly how youll explain that you dont like him romantically youll be much more likely to make things more awkward or to get caught in a web of excuses that make everything worse   Prepare to keep it simple You wont have to go into all of the reasons why you only like him as a friend Practice your tone Say everything you plan on saying aloud so you feel more comfortable when the time comes   Before you tell him you should predict how hell react Will he be shocked into silence or hurt If the guy is your friend you should have some inkling of how hell react so you should prepare to react accordingly   If hes a shy and sensitive guy then he may not have much to say afterwards Think of a few reassuring words you can say or even a few lighthearted comments that can make it easier If hes going to be really hurt prepare to support him You dont have to apologize for not liking him but you can be there for him and tell him not to be so upset Hes a great guy and hell definitely find someone else
She doesnt mind you touching her Try bumping into the girl stand so that your arms touch any kind of Kino will immediately be noticed trust me shes a girl Once they notice the touch they have two choices to either move or stay If they stay she is at least comfortable with you 5 Points She is willing to hold eye contact Assuming of course that this girl is not incredibly shy if you can look her into the eyes while you are talking to her and you find her staring directly back only turning away occasionally to smile then you are definitely making a good impression 2 Points She always seems to have lip gloss on Ok so this is very key As subtle as this one is pretty much every girl does it When a girl fantasizes about a guy usually there is a lot of kissing involved Whereas guys tend to skip the kiss and jump to the ravaging If a girl is always keeping her lips nice and glossy around you she is hoping that by the off chance a kiss does happen she will be prepared 2 Points She always keeps you in her vision range The average persons field of vision is about 150 degrees This means that at any time a person sees about 40 of the activity around them If you somehow always end up in that 40 well She probably likes you â1 Pointâ She brings up things you guys have talked about Yea you forgot that you mentioned how much you enjoy fishing last week when you saw her Now she is trying to invite you on a fishing trip with half the people on her contacts list 1 Point She tries to get you to hang out with her best friend and her best friends Boyfriend AKA she wants you for a double date but is too shy to ask for the date Even if it is just with her best friend youre still pretty in Think about it would you show a horribly unattractive girl off to your best friend Bonus points if this happens shortly after you meet her 4 Points She is naturally competitive with other women around you Practice complimenting people often just in general not exclusively Youll notice that girls who like you will pay a lot of attention to any compliments you throw out and subconsciously adjust themselves accordingly If you tell someone you love it when a girl wears blue and the next week she starts to look like a smurf you are in 5 Points She seems like she is always having a good time around you When it comes down to it This is the best indicator Most girls in their 20s now start to realize that their lives arent the exciting fairy tales they always thought theyd live No daddy is around to love and care for them No more boys are leaving love notes in their lockers No more all day hikes and spontaneous camping trips But wait every time she is with you all these childhood delights seem to be coming back She is in that naive bliss once again and you have done your job as a man She has checked you off as a possible Provider Protector and Partner 10 Points She never seems to have anything to do after seeing you You know why Its because she made sure of it She didnt need an escape plan because she didnt plan on escaping She cleared up her todos because she wanted to spend the entire day with you If you didnt have to go home to save the world from an endless horde of Nazi Zombies she would still be hanging out with you 3 Points After she said she has no plans she turns out to have a few If for some reason you bump into her later in the day or go back because you forgot your phone and it turns out that she is hanging out with somebody That means that she had a bunch of people she wanted to see but kept putting them off to spend more time with you alone 3 Points  However use common sense there is a difference between being persistent and being needy for example if the girl is saying No again and again but still smiling and talking to you then asking her again with another angle could be beneficial On the other hand if she is saying No again and again with a serious tone and body language this is a cue for you to back off and leave her alone

If heâs happy and upbeat when heâs saying goodbye to you but quiet and withdrawn when youâre together it may be a sign that heâs seeing another girl Balancing more than one relationship is difficult so it may start to take its toll on your boyfriendProblems in one relationship can carry over to the other so if your boyfriend is fighting with his other girlfriend you may deal with the fallout in your relationship   Thatâs because he may no longer have much emotion to invest in your relationship if heâs putting all of his feelings into another relationshipSee how he reacts when you say âI love youâ If heâs reluctant to even say âMe tooâ thatâs a big red flag   If heâs no longer as affectionate as he used to be it can be a sign that heâs seeing someone else and saving his affection for her A noticeable decrease in kisses hugs and other physical displays of affection can be a sign that heâs cheatingAll affection doesnât have to be physical If he stops using his favorite nickname for you or doesnât use your special emojis in texts you should also pay attention   Sometimes guilt can cause a guy to overcompensate so if heâs cheating he may try to make up for it by being overly nice Showering you with gifts taking you to your favorite restaurant or allowing you to choose what you watch on TV can all be signs that heâs trying to ease a guilty conscienceGuys are usually plagued by guilt and become overly affectionate in the early stages of cheating As the relationship with the other woman continues the guilt  and the increased attention  may diminish He may try to start arguments with you so he has an excuse to leave and go see another girl If your boyfriend suddenly starts picking fights every time that youâre together and you didnât use to fight that often itâs probably a cause for concern If your boyfriend starts accusing you of cheating even though thereâs no credible evidence it may be a sign that heâs seeing someone else Thatâs because he may be projecting his own behavior onto you  he knows that heâs cheating so he assumes you must be too  or he may simply be trying to deflect the guilt that he feels
In particular see if thereâs a change If you two used to hang out all the time alone and sheâs suddenly reluctant to do that itâs possible that she has a crush on you and is feeling nervous about it On the other hand if you usually only hang out in a group and she starts seeking out time alone with you she may have a crush on you   A tomboy may be more willing to make it clear that she is seeking out time with you than other girls would Boys are often socialized to ask directly for what they want instead of being coy Itâs likely that sheâs modeling her behavior on more masculine flirting so she may be very direct  This one is a little tricky because good eye contact could also just mean good social skills If you observe that sheâs making eye contact a little longer than what seems normal thatâs a good sign that sheâs into you Alternatively if you notice that sheâs refusing to meet your gaze especially if this is different from before this may be a sign that sheâs feeling shy about looking at you because she likes you  Particularly if it seems like youâre flirting with someone else does she look put off or angry Does she tend to avoid you or act aggressively after she sees you do this   Especially if you have a crush on her too donât flirt with other people just to make her jealous This is confusing and mean both her and the person youâre flirting with Just interact normally and see if a normal interaction makes her appear jealous   Is she âaccidentallyâ touching you a lot For example does she bump into you with her elbow at the lunch table when thereâs plenty of room to avoid you Do her fingers brush against yours when she hands you a pencil If so thereâs a good chance sheâs âaccidentallyâ touching you on purpose because she likes you   Touch is often key in tomboy flirting style because masculine flirting tends to include more touching than feminine flirting Does she hit you more than usual Unfortunately one way that boys are socialized to show affection is through wrestling and punching A tomboy or girl who emulates more masculine behavior might do the same thing if she has a crush on you If this is the case and it makes you uncomfortable itâs okay to discourage this behavior or tell an adult if you think itâs gotten out of hand In particular does she laugh even when your jokes arenât even that funny or when other people donât seem to even notice youâre joking This is a pretty good sign that sheâs into you especially if she hasnât always laughed at your jokes or given any indication that she thinks youâre funny In particular pay attention her reactions to some light teasing Donât hurt her feelings or be mean Just tease her enough to let her know youâre paying attention to her and see if this causes a bit of blushing or extra laughter   Leaning toward someone is a sign that youâre engaged and paying attention Particularly if the two of you are part of a larger group of people if she leans in toward you thereâs a good chance sheâs inviting further conversation with you because sheâs interested in you On the other hand she could just be having a hard time hearing what youâre saying so be look for other signs of attraction too   Blushing is a sign that sheâs either nervous or excited either of which can be a good indication that she likes you In particular if this girl has been your friend for a while pay attention to whether she has recently started blushing when you talk  Head tilting indicates that a person is paying good attention to what youâre saying and that theyâre engaged in thinking about your conversation This action combined with other signs of attraction can be signals that she likes you Of course if youâre talking about her favorite sports team itâs possible that sheâs just engaged in the conversation and doesnât actually have a crush on you Are there any other signs of attraction also present   Does she mess with her hair a lot Adjust her clothing Touch her face Some of this could be nervousness which may be an indication that she likes you and is feeling shy This could also indicate that she wants to be sure she looks okay in front of you Particularly look out for preening that seems out of character If this girl rarely cares what her hair looks like which may be common for tomboys but is suddenly invested in smoothing out her ponytail all the time thatâs could be a clue that she wants to look nice for you   Some studies have shown that if a person points their feet in your direction while you interact they are attracted to or at least interested in you If a person points their feet away from you particularly in the direction of an escape route itâs less likely that theyâre attracted to you One interaction wonât necessarily give you all of the information you need here If her feet are pointed toward the end of the hall instead of toward you while youâre chatting at your lockers itâs possible that sheâs just in a hurry to get to class Take some time and observe her feet in several interactions   Does she ask you a lot of questions Does she seem overly interested in what you did this weekend or what you had for breakfast Though itâs possible that sheâs just being polite thereâs a good chance that sheâs just trying to keep talking to you for longer because she thinks youâre cute  Are there lots of jokes that you two would make a cute couple Have any of them asked you if you have a crush on her Do they bring her name up to you a lot Itâs possible that she has confessed to some of her friends that she likes you so listen up   Tomboys tend to have friends of all genders Be sure to pay attention to each group of friends she hangs out with   If this girl has been your friend for a while youâll probably notice when sheâs acting differently all of a sudden Ultimately if you suspect that she has a crush on you youâre probably right   If she likes you sheâll respond positively to some light flirting Bring up an inside joke âaccidentallyâ touch her elbow with yours laugh at her jokes or just smile at her more than you usually would If she reciprocates she might have a crush on you   If youâre on a sports team together or tend to join the same pickup basketball game after school this is a great time to get in some lowstakes flirting   A single elbow bump at your lockers might not mean that she has a crush on you But if she bumps elbows with you more than once always angles her body toward you when you talk laughs at even your dumbest jokes AND seems worried about how her hair looks in front of you then that all may add up to a crush  When all else fails if you really want to know if she likes you itâs time to ask Try to ask her in private because you might feel embarrassed if you ask in front of others and she might be too embarrassed to tell the truth   Beware that asking could put a strain on your friendship if she says no That doesnât necessarily mean that if she rejects you you canât be friends anymore It just means that you will have to work extra hard to bring things back to normal Take the risk if youâre pretty sure she likes you If you like her too the payoff of having your friend become your girlfriend would be worth it   Particularly if this girl has been your friend for a long time itâs possible that her attention to you is nothing more than a sign of friendship If you have a crush on her if you think she might also have one on you and if you want to pursue it give it a shot Just beware that things could be a bit awkward between you if it doesnât work out
Is she acting differently around you lately or asking for your input on major life decisions Some people might read this as a sign of a strengthening friendship but it could also be a sign that shes ready to take things to the next level   Does she consistently return your phone calls and text messages Does she show up at important events that you ask her to attend Someone who consistently makes times for you could be interested in being more than just friends   Ask your friends what they think about her attitude towards you If the general consensus is that she likes you you can feel comfortable about trying to move forward If they all think she just sees you as a friend you may want to back off from making any strong advances
Talk to her in a friendly and casual way You dont have to make it obvious that you like her try just being friends first While talking be confident Most likely shes nervous too Most girls will appreciate a guy that takes the lead That way they dont have to stutter and mumble their way into a conversation  Dont dress like a slob in a baggy chili stained sweatshirt and sweat pants but dont wear a suit and tie everyday either Its also important to smell good Wear a scent that isnt too strong and dont spray it on too heavy Theres nothing worse than the girl you like being covered in your cologne after she talks with you   Some girls are more confident than others and some will take them well and some wont If your girl is on the less than confident side dont attempt a joke about her appearance She might take you seriously and think youre a jerk Also make sure that your jokes are actually funny If you are talking about that hard math test dont relate it to your friends pet turtle It not only be a mood killer but just plain awkward   Maybe youre both book or band geeks or love the same movie If your girl is into something that youre not try to be open minded about it For example if she likes painting grab a brush and try it with her You could also try something new to both of you If you both have never tried photography take a class together Something you thought of before as stupid or boring could actually turn out to be really fun Another thing to try would be dancing classes Dancing is classically romantic and taking a class will set the mood without being too obvious   Its pretty embarrassing to show up without a present or at least something to say when its a special day   Go to her sporting events recitals concerts art shows and performances Its important to encourage her hobbies and interests by attending to show that you care   It doesnt have to be anything fancy just a stuffed animal or a card Maybe you dont have a lot of money to spend Thats okay Just a heartfelt letter can be enough Dont make a big deal of it either Just slip something in her locker or send her a text or an email Even a cheery Happy birthday the next time you see her will make her pleased that you remembered   It comes off as annoying or even conceited when guys constantly brag It doesnt hurt to mention something about your football practice the other day but dont constantly say things like Since Im the star on the football team this will be no problem   When guys always follow whatever the new trend is they start to be less like themselves and more and more like other people Its good for the world to have differences because if everyone in the world were the same life would be really boring Dont be someone youre not just to impress her If she doesnt like you for you shes not the right girl for you   Sports are fun and healthy activities to be involved in and help make you a well rounded person But remember that its good to be involved in more than just sports There are a wide range of activities to choose from including music theatre dancing photography visual arts singing playing an instrument book clubs environment clubs wood shops writing workshops and countless others Being involved will show your girl that you know how to live life to the fullest   Its good to remember to stay focused on schoolwork because it will benefit you in the future Girls also enjoy studying with guys and its a good way to spend quality time with the girl you like   Dont talk with your mouth full and remember to use a napkin When meeting her parents say please and thank you Don burp pass gas sneeze or cough dont do it in front of her If you absolutely have to leave the room for a moment Sometimes this happens accidentally and that can be really embarrassing Just say excuse me and move on Try to avoid making a joke unless she laughs Then its okay Otherwise Its just rude and disgusting   Treat the girl you like as if she were any other friend at first Dont be afraid to punch her on the arm give her a high five or give her a hug None of these things have to be romantic so there shouldnt be any difference Once you and your girl start to become closer than you can start with the romantic stuff   Dont go crazy and start bringing her flowers but try to be subtle When you two are alone and happy lightly brush your hand against hers Look at her face to see if she responds well If she still looks happy gently take hold of her hand Be gentle and dont make a big deal out of it If she seems uncomfortable let go Most likely she will be happy that you were brave enough to map the first move and might be more comfortable seeing you as a romantic partner rather than a friend If your girl is still responding well put your arm around her If she likes that its all downhill from there   Eg do not tell her GMtomboymade Nissan or Nissanrecallesque GM Thisll get her NOT to like you

In many cases you can allow the pregnancy to proceed normally but make sure you have a vet on hand in case there are complications which are more likely if your pig is older or younger or has not given birth previouslyTry to find a vet who specializes in rodents and other small animals rather than just a generic vet   If you have multiple sows remove the male pig immediately to prevent others from becoming pregnant Even if this is the only sow you own you should still remove the male pig before she reaches 60 days in her pregnancy It is best to house the male in an adjacent cage where he can still be close to the female A male guinea pig who can not see or hear his mate may develop stress making him susceptible to illness   Male guinea pigs will continue to mount pregnant sows which can cause stress or pain to your pregnant sow late in the pregnancy after the 50day mark She could also become pregnancy just two hours after she gives birth   Youll want to make sure your pig is getting sufficient food water and nutrients since these things are also helping the fetuses develop   Feed your guinea pig alfalfa hay instead of timothy hay so that she gets more protein and calcium Your pregnant sow will also need more vitamin C after 4 weeks about twice as much so incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables high in vitamin C into her diet In addition you may want to increase your guinea pigs fiber intake Increased fiber intake can prevent hair thinning which is common in the last stage of pregnancy   You should weigh your guinea pig twice a week to make sure that is gaining weight and not losing it and is generally healthy eg eating all her food still social and interactive etc and check shes healthy   If at any point her weight begins to fall or if she begins to show signs of illness consult a vet immediately   Try to make your guinea pigs life follow a routine so as to minimize stress which can aggravate the dangers that accompany guinea pig pregnancy   Avoid making changes to a pregnant sows cage like removing toys or putting the cage in a totally new location This could increase her stress and affect her eating and drinking habitsReduce her exposure to loud noises or bright lights including direct sunlight Reduce handling to a minimum and dont handle her within two weeks of the birth Note that the gestation period is usually 66  72 days
The easiest and most effective way is to just ask your friends crush about their feelings If youre having trouble working up the courage to ask such a personal question theres a few ways to make the process easier   Consider the time and place youre going to have the conversation Make sure the crush is in a comfortable area probably out of earshot from anyone who could listen in Be gentle Dont use confrontational lines such as Everyone knows you like Ryan Just come out and say it Instead you might say You seem really happy around Ryan Do you think you might have feelings for him Dont pry too much if they seem uncomfortable If the crush seems to get embarrassed during your conversation back off a bit They may need time before theyre willing to divulge such sensitive feelings   Instead of asking the crush directly about your friend try starting with their love life in general Ask to see if theyre dating anyone or if theyre currently looking to find a love interest   Ask your friends crush less leading questions about your friend and see if they naturally bring up their potential attraction Try questions such as So how did you and Cayla meet or How long have you known each other
This might take a while and you shouldnt force yourself to like someone right away In this position of depression you are very vulnerable to emotional attacks Just go with the flow and avoid her Go different ways  She has her boyfriend because she likes him   Youll just be digging a deeper hole for yourself   Go for it Theres plenty of fish in the sea   Dont just stay at home thinking about what shes doing with the boyfriend   There is always someone better   Seeing her and her boyfriend there will just hurt   Shell just be suspicious   Thats just not cool   After all your degree is more important   It will only make the situation between you and the girl worse If you fight one of you might get injured whether or not you fought It may lead to having the authorities called andor a restraining order Be Careful   Maybe shes not lucky enough to have a guy like you   If you find this difficult consider relocating if the option is available
As you start planning for a project or work youll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches While everyone has a strategy there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to refind the cool idea you saw three months ago Try out   Dedicating 1 notebook preferably with insert folders to each project Making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration Tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace Very few artists simply dive right into large projects Almost 100 of the time they instead work on related smaller projects called studies to prepare for the larger work You might practice the face of the portrait youre making sketch our different composition ideas or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture Keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills ideas and supplies needed for the final project   At the end of the day artists are visual people and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process Of course neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies Find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use and leaving a little bit of essential clutter Its okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio  just make sure its the inspiration you need for the current project   Just because you arent organized is no excuse not to make an attempt Dont feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess there is a middle ground   Nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize youve run out of white paint halfway through a section Once a week or more frequently if possible check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem   A simple spreadsheet or notebook marked at the end of each artistic session is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff   Deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking But sketching the idea transposing the image onto the wall painting the basic colors then adding shadingdetail are four separate and more manageable projects Organization is key to big projects even if it feels constraining to your creativity In reality organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative instead of worrying about logistics   Figure out the building blocks of each part of the project tackling each at once Dont jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly

If you want to forget your crush then the first thing you have to do is to admit that you have strong feelings for this person If youâre in denial about how much your crush means to you then youâll just keep all of those intense feelings inside instead of letting them go Take the time to cry to talk to a close friend about it to admit how much youâve been hurt and to acknowledge your feelings   Write down what youâre feeling if that helps If you donât want to open up to a friend opening up to a journal can make you feel better too If youâre going to be upset for a little while because things didnât work out with your crush thatâs okay Let your friends know that youâre going to lie low for a little while and donât force yourself to be super social if youâre just not feeling it That being said after a few weeks or so itâs time to stop wallowing and to start having some form of social interaction If you spent too much time being alone with your feelings you may only feel worse  You may have many reasons for feeling angry or bitter Maybe your crush really hurt you Maybe you were so sure things would work out and they didnât Maybe your crush ended up dating one of your friends and youâre feeling mad at both of them These feelings will naturally accompany the situation youâre in but that doesnât mean that they are healthy or that they can help you move on   Write down all of the reasons why youâre feeling angry and bitter Acknowledging your pain is crucial to forgetting it Once youâve figured out where all of your negative feelings are coming from you can begin to tackle them one by one If you come in contact with your crush donât let them see how angry or bitter you may be feeling The best thing you can do is act completely indifferent like you could care less about what your crush is up to If you keep faking indifference youâll be surprised by how quickly youâll really start to feel it   Stop thinking about how goodlooking funny or sweet your crush is whenever they pop in your mind Instead focus on all of the bad parts about your crush from their weird fashion sense or their ability to be mean to perfect strangers Make a list of all of these qualities if it helps When your crush comes to mind conjure up all of these negative thoughts instead of the positive ones This will help you remember that your crush isnât really such a great person after all   If you think that your crush is perfect and that you really canât think of one bad thing about them then guess what You donât really know that person all that well There is no such thing as a perfect person and everyone has flaws The more you think about all of the bad aspects of your crush the sooner youâll see that you two arenât right for each other after all   You may think that you and your crush would be the worldâs most perfect couple but thatâs just not the case If you really belonged together then it would happen wouldnât it For whatever reason it didnât work out between you and your crush and itâs likely that itâs because youâre simply just too good for them Your crush is not your soul mate and once you realize that youâll be able to find someone who you do deserve   Sure you may have heard all of your friends telling you that you deserve better than your crush over and over again but this wonât sink in until you realize it for yourself   If youâre feeling down in the dumps about things not working out with your crush then itâs likely that you need to pump yourself up You probably are feeling down on yourself and like youâre unworthy in some way because youâre not dating your crush but thatâs the farthest thing from the truth Remember your most amazing qualities focus on all of the great friends and opportunities in your life and remember your favorite personality traits Keep telling yourself that you are an amazing person who only deserves the best â and âthe bestâ simply does not refer to your crush   Staying positive is key here If you focus on all of the good things in your life and in your character instead of the things you donât have then youâll be able to move on much faster than you would if you only saw the worst in every situation   It may sound obvious that you should stop talking to your crush if you want to forget them but chances are that you may still be talking to your crush even if you know itâs not good for you You donât have to be downright rude but you should make a point of avoiding your crush and not talking to them as much as you can Stop texting calling or just stopping and saying hi to your crush The sooner you stop seeing your crush and hearing their voice the sooner youâll be able to really get your crush out of your life   If you have to be in the same place as your crush like a class for example then you should be nice and polite without making an effort Thereâs no need to be mean and it wonât make you feel better   Though talking to a close friend about forgetting your crush can help you move on if you talk about your crush to every single person you come across or every mutual friend you have then you wonât be feeling better any time soon You donât have to be denial about your feelings but if you keep mentioning your crush youâll only be opening up old wounds and reminding yourself of the very thing that hurt you   If you do have mutual friends avoid asking about how your crush is doing How will that make you feel better   If youâre only going on Facebook Instagram or any other social networking sites to stalk your crush and to see if theyve been dating anyone else or hanging out with that cute person in your chem class then you should take a social media break If you really do love Facebook then avoid the temptation to click on their profile and use it to stay in touch with the people who actually make you feel good Seeing pictures of your crush is guaranteed to make you feel worse so stop torturing yourself   Give yourself a time limit â say youâll only spend 15 minutes a day on Facebook If you want to spend that time stalking your crush then you wonât get to see what the people who actually care about you are up to   Though you donât have to change your schedule completely if you really want to forget your crush then you should try to avoid all of the places where you know youâll see them Donât go to their favorite restaurant or movie theatre if youâre pretty sure theyll be there on a Friday night If you know theyâll be going to a certain party and youâre still feeling really hurt then find something else to do   This does not mean that your crush âwonâ and that you canât do anything fun anymore it just means you have to avoid them for a little while until you feel better   If you want to get your crush out of your life then itâs time to switch things up Have something different for breakfast Meet a new friend for lunch instead of the same old friends Pick up a new hobby Drive to school or work by a different route Though these changes may not be directly related to your crush just making an effort to get out of the mindset that got you hung up on your crush in the first place can help you start to look at the world differently and to stop thinking the same thoughts that revolve around your crush   Think about it are there certain times of day when you think about your crush the most If so can you do something differently during those times so you will be more likely to forget about them instead For example if you always stare out the window on the bus ride home and think sad thoughts about your crush find a new pump up album and listen to that during your ride home so it becomes a positive experience instead of a time when you think about your crush   One great way to forget about your crush is to spend as much time as possible with the people who mean the most to you Your friends and family have been there for you through thick and thin and they will make you feel better about your romantic situation just by being there for you Though your social routine doesnât have to be so jam packed that you donât have a minute to yourself you should make an effort to spend more time with your loved ones so you can be grateful for all of the positive relationships in your life â instead of obsessing over the one relationship that didnât pan out   Donât spend your Friday or Saturday nights alone or youâll wish you were with your crush Hang out with your girl or guy friends instead and youâll be having so much fun that youâll forget all about your crush   Spending time doing something that means a lot to you is a sure fire way to banish any thoughts about your crush from your mind You should spend more time pursuing your favorite hobby whether itâs running or painting exercising reading or just doing whatever makes you happy Maybe you think youâre too busy to make time for the things you care about If thatâs the case then make the time by cutting something else out of your life if youâre committed to pursuing your passion then all thoughts of your crush will slowly drift away   Maybe youâre feeling so down in the dumps about your crush because you donât have a lot of things that you really care about It could be time to find out what your passion really is by taking a class out of your comfort zone signing up for a photography ballroom dancing acting or singing class or just trying something completely new that you have a feeling might make you happy   Though spending time with your friends and family and doing your favorite activities can make you forget your crush if you really want to find peace on your own then you have to be comfortable with spending some time with your favorite person â you If youâre really sad and upset the second youâre not keeping busy then you havenât really gotten over your crush yet Make weekly âme datesâ and spend that time doing something you really love â or just relaxing and watching your favorite TV show or taking a long hot bath It doesnât matter what you do â what matters is that you really enjoy doing it alone   Donât let lastminute plans with friends get in the way of your âme timeâ You should treasure your âme timeâ like itâs a hot date with your favorite celebrity   Donât hole up in your dark sad cave thinking about all the reasons why it didnât work out with your crush get outside and breathe some fresh air instead Just being out in the sun and breathing fresh air instead of hanging out at home will make you feel more alive alert energetic and happier If you have to do some work then donât hole up in your room and go to a coffee shop or park instead Just being around other people even if youâre not talking to them will make you feel happier and will make you less likely to dwell on your crush   Make sure to get out of the house at least once a day even if itâs just to take a half hour walk Staying inside for an entire day is guaranteed to make anyone feel unhappy whether theyâre trying to get over someone or not   If you want to really get over your crush then you canât just be miserable by yourself and wait for someone new to come along You have to be truly content with being on your own doing your own thing hanging out with your friends and doing some casual flirting that wonât lead anywhere You should appreciate the freedom that singledom can bring and know that while dating someone can be fun and fulfilling it should not determine whether youâre happy or sad   Give it time It can take weeks or even months to appreciate being single but once you do youâll see that you never really needed your crush after all â what you needed was an idea of your crush that you thought would lead you to happiness but it wasnât the answer you were looking for in the end   Once youâve done all the right things â adjusted your perspective gotten rid of thoughts of your crush and moved forward to do the things that make you happy â then you can really congratulate yourself for forgetting your crush You have seen how great your life is without your crush how amazing you are and how lucky you are for the life you have If youâre really over your crush then you can slowly start to open up your heart and start crushing on someone new   If youâve really moved on then celebrate your victory and get excited about all of the love that will come your way
Ask a friend that she is not entirely unknown to her to ask her if she likes you Like Do you like this personÂ  I was just thinking that the way you look at him And the way you smile at him That youve been hitting on him  Your relationship with your crush may feel awkward and tight after she discovers your feelings for her Not only may she avoid you but she may also refuse to talk to you for a while However know that it is not necessarily you she doesnt want to see but she may be only trying to ignore the awkward feelings in order to prevent herself from making stupid mistakes If you dont believe in yourself and have confidence that youll get through this with her it makes the situation harder to solve and you may not have enough courage to rescue your relationship with her   Although things may not feel the same act as if they are It will cause her to relax and slowly let her guard down because shell know that youre still the same person she is friends with even though she now knows you have feelings for her You may need to crack a few more jokes than usual in order to get her laughing but making her feel comfortable with you should be your top priority right now   It may be hard to act as if the awkwardness doesnt exist but after a while it wont exist at all if you try hard enough However avoid going overboard and acting fake A fake smile and stiff words will take you nowhere and it may worsen the situation       Make no mention of your feelings for her Although you may be curious dont ask her how she feels about you At this point she may feel very confused insecure and uncomfortable You dont want her to start avoiding you because this could lead to the death of your relationship with her Keep romance out of your conversations and interactions with her While the temptation to flirt with her remains resist it at least until she settles down and is relaxed with you once more   Despite the circumstances and how insecure you both may feel act happy and go about your life normally Happiness and smiles tend to be contagious and you may be able to smooth out your relationship with her even faster if you have a joyful bright attitude that makes her smile and laugh However avoid going overboard and acting extremely crazy Unless if she is used to your insane behavior you should refrain from this behavior at this point because you might unintentionally scare her off   This will show that you have an interest in the conversation and what she is saying Also it will make her feel comfortable because she has the assurance that someone is listening to her However avoid staring at her or she might feel uncomfortable but remember not to look bored or look away too often Find a healthy amount of eye contact in order to benefit both you and her   Although you have the option of sitting directly next to her you may also choose to occupy the seat behind her or in front of her Dont feel limited when it comes to your seating options While you may believe that sitting next to her is the only way to get her attention remember that sitting behind her and in front of her hold their own advantages as well Use your seat near her as an opportunity to talk to her and work together with her However be familiar with the appropriate times to speak in order to avoid getting her in trouble   One way to get her attention is to immediately take the blame if the teacher catches both of you talking Not only will she feel grateful towards you but shell also think of you as a kind person especially if you already are kind towards her However avoid treating her as if she is helpless because shell only feel annoyed       If you sit near her youll have the chance to ask her to work with her on group projects and assignments However avoid asking her too frequently in order to give her the chance to work with her friends and other students she may want to interact with  Even if she rejects your offer know that the thought counts Try again another time when she seems in a good mood Having a good relationship with her can increase your chances of being accepted If she constantly rejects your offer know when to stop asking her This shows that she may not be interested in you Stop before she has to ask you to stop     It helps if you perform better in those classes than her but remember not to act as if you are better than her or know more than her Although one of the two may be true you should never make her feel bad about herself You want to make her feel good about herself when she is around you Then shell want to be with you more often   Only offer to tutor her if she asks you or complains about the poor grades she is receiving in the class Depending on the type of person she is she may take your kind offer as an insult and she may refuse to speak to you afterwards       If she accepts your offer to study with hertutor her make your times with her comfortable and memorable Treat her as if she was a good friend Avoid staring at her or inserting romance and flirting into your interactions with her Youll make her feel uncomfortable and she may not want to study with you  She may feel surprised at first if you treat her like a good friend but shell eventually get used to it and enjoy it Use this method to become good friends with her quickly     You may have to start most of the conversations at first but once she gets used to talking to you every day shell eventually start the conversations without you having to approach her first However if she is shy she may enjoy talking to you but she may not have enough courage to approach you Know that it is not you she is avoiding but she may be too shy   During these conversations subtly read her body language Note how comfortable she feels and the physical contact she makes with you ex touching your arm or shoulder while laughing at your jokes Run her words through your mind and search for any hints of her feelings for you       Remember to have a healthy amount of eye contact with her End the conversation before it turns into an awkward silence While you dont want to abruptly end it at the wrong time make sure you finish it in a polite manner when it is still good Although you may not want to end it its best that you may her look forward to the future conversations since they all end on a good note It may take a few conversations and some practice before you know when to perfectly end it but keep persisting till you understand  Have a good excuse when you end it so that suspicion and hurt feelings dont rise within her when you leave Always end it in a friendly manner while showing you enjoyed talking to her and would like to have another conversation with her ex It was nice talking to you but I have to finish my chores now or Lets continue this conversation another time I dont want to be late for class     This step should be performed only when you two have gotten to know each other well enough Invite your friends to the movies along with her but make sure she is not the only girl in order to avoid making her feel uncomfortable or insecure Select a movie you know she would enjoy or ask her to choose one Before the movie starts purchase a separate drink for her if you wish  do not share a drink with her  and a bag of popcorn for you both to share If you offer to share the popcorn with her before the movie starts the chances of you being able to sit next to her increase During the movie make sure you occupy the seat next to her One way to ensure that the seat is yours is to follow her behind That way youll know where she is sitting and youll be close enough to immediately sit down next to her   Avoid selecting romantic movies because it may lead to her to remember that you like her and she may feel extremely uncomfortable Select a comedy or an action movie to get you all laughing       Act like a gentleman This includes opening the doors for her and allowing her to go ahead of you However avoid acting as if she is helpless because this will only annoy her and make her feel bad about herself Your conversations with her afterwards can consist of the movie and whether she enjoyed it or not Afterwards invite her to other group outings but make sure they dont occur too frequently in order to give her the opportunity to attend other outings she would like to go to If you play sports invite her to your games even if you know she doesnt enjoy watching sports She may appear at your games just to support you if she has feelings for you   However make sure your gifts for her are not sappy or romantic They should be the type of gifts that make her smile and enjoy them An example would be to purchase her the CD album she has always wanted   If you want to give her a gift on Valentines Day make sure your gift isnt romantic Avoid going to elaborate lengths and making her feel uncomfortable Instead purchase an object as simple as a cute teddy bear         Not only is this sweet but this will make her feel more comfortable She will have enough time to respond as she pleases and shell also have more time to sort through her thoughts and feelings She may be able to come up with an answer that is better than the answer she may give you if you ask her right on the spot Shell be able to think logically and ask for needed advice and the choice that she makes will be much wiser and healthy for both of you depending on her personality   Add a small spritz of your cologne onto the letter so that it leaves a faint pleasant smell This will instantly make her think of you and itll be harder for her to get you out of her mind       Avoid adding too much cologne so that it creates an overwhelmingly powerful smell Annoyance may prickle her and she may dislike you     This requires a lot of courage and bravery which will make her think twice before answering you She might feel impressed if you yourself approach her and she wont think of you as a coward However make sure you ask about her feelings for you in an area where she feels comfortable but make sure no one is listening to your conversation   because it is less intimate and she may think of you as a coward since you have a screen to hide yourself behind   Not only will you appear as a coward but shell also feel more intimidated because your friend might tell others about her answer Pressure may influence her into making a bad choice or sharing her true feelings for her This may lead her to come up with a lie or a sharp answer to discourage you from pursuing her   Not only will she be unaware of who her secret admirer is but shell also be uncertain of who to reply to Leaving yourself as anonymous tends to be cowardly and it can make her feel annoyed She may end up trashing the letter or leaving no response because she wont know who sent the letter or how to answer   If you send her another letter in the future and sign it she may connect the dots and instantly know it was you who wrote the anonymous letter She may dislike you because of your cowardly move and you will not leave a good impression upon her
Are you going to break up with him because hes not treating you right because youve lost interest or because youre both too busy to make it work Whatever your reason you have to figure out exactly what youre going to say and how youre going to say it If its something like you falling out of love or falling for someone else then you can find a nice way of ending it that would cause the least damage   Though honesty is important you dont have to tell him everything if it would only hurt him If youve fallen out of love you may not want to be so blunt about it  You dont want him to completely break down if it comes as a shock Though you shouldnt be too obvious about it you dont want to throw your man completely off guard with the breakup That means that he shouldnt think that everything is peachy keen the day before the break up or even the week before Once youve made up your mind you should break up with him as soon as possible but if you have to wait a few days to do it then try to act more cold and distant in the meantime   Dont tell him how much you love him or kiss him or act affectionate with him   Dont be a coward and send him a note email text or phone call Unless youre in a long distance relationship or he has a reputation for being violent when he gets bad news you owe him the courtesy of meeting him in person one last time If you dont do it in person hell reach out to you anyway and youll have to rehash the same painful conversation but it wont be on your terms as much   If you dont do it in person he will hold it against you after the relationship is over   Its important to break up with the boy as soon as you can after making your decision That being said you shouldnt go and break up with him the second you you know it or you might end up blurting it out in public or at an inopportune moment Just pick a time when youll be alone and will have some privacy but nowhere romantic so he wont get the wrong idea   Dont go to one of your favorite hangouts or he will be even more crushed with the bad news because hell be thinking of all the great memories youve shared Dont do it the second he gets off work or right before a big test Pick a time when hell be reasonably relaxed and wont have anything else to think or worry about   Tell him the truth as much as you can Dont be mean or tell liesâtell him simply that you dont think that the relationship is working out Try to avoid lets just be friends or its not you its me as these cliches will make it sound like you havent put much thought into his feelings Let him know that its time to move on that it just isnt working and that you hope the two of you can do this maturely   Look him in the eyes when youre talking Let him see that this is hurting you too   Its likely that he will want a bigger explanation even if he doesnt say it right away Be open to talking to him It will show him youre open to talking and thus that youll work to be a good friend when hes ready It will also give him the closure that he may need to move on   He may not want to ask questions or talk at all though he may come to you with questions later Thats fine If he really doesnt want to talk dont push it   There are a number of ways he can react if hes stunned into silence or just wants to leave right away then fine But he might really really want to know why And you might just have to tell him  to the extent that you can without hurting his feelings If you think he doesnt care about you give him one or two concrete examples as long as it doesnt sound accusatory   Usually you wont need to go into it that much If you have an idea that its not working then he will probably be on the same page   Though you may be angry hurt or crushed theres no need to go into it by calling him names being rude or making him feel even worse You should go into it with your head held high and have him think of you as positively as he can when he looks back on the relationship No matter how bad things are things were probably pretty good once and theres no reason to ruin all that just because youre angry or hurt   If he really hurt you of course then this doesnt mean that you should be super nice to him Just avoid cursing slapping him or being excessively mean   Once youve said your part and have answered a few of his questions then its time to say goodbye Theres really no point in lingering sitting around crying and holding each other and generally making yourselves more upset The more youll sit there the more all of those feelings will come rushing back and the more hurt sad confused disappointed and heartbroken you both will feelOnce theres nothing left to say say goodbye   This is not a negotiation but a notification Dont let your boyfriend convince you that you should really be together that youve got it all wrong or that hell change completely and be perfect for you Youve made up your mind and theres no turning back now You had good reasons for breaking up with him and you should stick to them no matter how hard it may be   Its important to be firm and to make it clear that you are breaking up not that you need some time apart Let him know that it is OVER with a capital O   Be sure he knows that you want to give him time to get over you though Let him know that youre not going to make the first move at the friendship but that once he feels ready to be friends he should give you a call This will help give you both time apart to get over the relationship Follow up on your promise to be friendly when he does call you   Though you both obviously wont be grinning ear to ear and hugging passionately as you say goodbye you should try to make things as amicable and polite as possible even if you feel like screaming your head off Be kind dont look like youre dying to get out of there and tell your boyfriend that youre sorry for how hes feeling Make it clear that you want things between you to be as positive as they can even if you need some space in the beginning   Namecalling flinging insults or shouting at each other wont lead to anything but more pain   This will not work no matter what good friends you were before the relationship or how amicably it all ended Theres just no chance you can go from BFGF to BFF so spare yourself the heartache of trying Spend some time apart and even go a week or two without really talking if its possible with your schedules Try to avoid places where hell be so you dont have to have awkward painful conversations Take the time to heal before you can decide whether friendship is on the horizon   If you do see him theres no need to be rude or to run in the other direction Be polite but keep things brief   Though you were the one who broke up with the boy you will still be feeling confused sad and hurt Thats only natural Both parties in a breakup have hard feelings no matter who ends it You may not be prepared for the fact that you might miss your boy and your relationship but part of you will So take it easy the next few weeks Lean on your girlfriends lay off the booze and get some muchneeded alone time   Dont jump in to a new relationship or start dating right away Youll need some time to deal with it   Just because the two of you are broken up doesnt mean you can go spreading his deepest darkest secrets You would want him to respect your privacy too wouldnt you Even if youre hurt or angry you shouldnt lash or make yourself look like a gossip just because the relationship is over If you do then other guys may not be too excited about being your boyfriend   When you talk about the relationship to others remain respectful   A breakup is not a contest and youre not going to win by hooking up with more people than your ex If you cant help but enjoy the single life keep the publicity to a minimum Dont post statuses or pictures of it on Facebook and dont parade around school with a new boy two days after the breakup This will only make your ex feel worse   Even if you have jumped in to a new relationship pretty soon after the breakup you shouldnt make it public right after the break up   If enough time has passed  and that could be months or even a year or two  and

problem your vet will need to determine the exact cause of the illness and how serious it is To do this they will perform a physical exam that will include listening to your guinea pigâs lungs Your vet will also take samples eg nasal swab discharge from the eyes or nose to identify the specific bacteria causing the respiratory infectionChest xrays can also help your vet diagnose your guinea pigâs respiratory problem Chest xrays will show whether your guinea pig has pneumoniaDental disease can cause respiratory problems in guinea pig because the roots of the cheek teeth premolars and molars are so close to the nasal passages If your guinea pig has dental disease skull xrays will help your vet see the extent of the disease If left untreated your guinea pigâs respiratory problem could make him extremely sick For example if he has a cold it could quickly progress to pneumonia which may be difficult for him to recover from The sooner you get him treated the better his chances

weakInjectable medications usually work faster than oral medications   If dental disease caused your guinea pigâs respiratory problems then your vet will need to treat it at the hospital Your vet will

bronchiseptica and Streptococcus pneumoniae â are the primary causes of respiratory infections in guinea pigsYour vet will use diagnostic test results to select which antibiotic will effectively treat your guinea pigâs respiratory problem Follow your vetâs instructions carefully to ensure all the bacteria is killed   The medication may come in liquid or pill form If the antibiotic comes in liquid form you can use a medicine dropper to put the prescribed number of drops into the corner of your guinea pigâs mouth If he resists that you could place the drops on his favorite foodTo give your guinea pig a pill place the pill back by your guinea pigâs molars so he wonât be able to easily spit it back out Consider putting the pill in a hemostat clamps that look like scissors to place and then release the pill in his mouthHemostats are available at your local drug store Contact your vet if you are having trouble giving your guinea pig the antibiotics   Some antibiotics can cause

important in preventing respiratory problems in guinea pigs A wire cage would provide more ventilation than a solid glass cageMake sure the cage is not in the direct path of a vent or draft â a constant draft of cool air could make your guinea pig sick If you have multiple guinea pigs they should be in a cage large enough to house all of them comfortably If the cage is too small your guinea pigs could develop respiratory infections from the stress of overcrowdingThe stress would weaken their immune systems and make them susceptible to infection   If you have 2 guinea pigs their cage should be at least 30 inches x 50 inches 76 cm x 127 cm Rabbits can harbor Bordatella in their bodies and pass it on to guinea pigs In addition a rabbit can bully a guinea pig causing the guinea pig stress if it cannot find a safe place to get away To prevent a respiratory infection house your rabbits and guinea pigs in different cagesThe stress from bullying could cause a respiratory problem by weakening your guinea pigâs immune system   Adequate amounts of vitamin C are essential to preventing respiratory problems in guinea pigs Guinea pigs cannot produce vitamin C in their bodies so they must get this nutrient from food Examples of vitamin Crich foods are broccoli parsley green peppers and mustard greensVitamin C dietary supplements are also available Talk to your vet before giving

One of the biggest differences between jaguars and leopards is their physical size Leopards are generally smaller than jaguars though size discrepancies exist within each speciesJaguars can grow up to 625 feet long 19 meters Adult jaguars can weigh up to 211 pounds 96 kilos and stand 25 to 30 inches 76 centimeters tall at the shouldersLeopards can grow up to 63 feet 192 meters in length and weigh up to 198 pounds 90 kgLeopards are taller than jaguars with adult leopards standing up to 31 inches 7874 centimeters tall at the shoulders  Another physical distinction between jaguars and leopards is the size of each animals head Jaguars typically have much larger heads than leopards which makes sense given the overall body size difference between these two cats The size and patterns on each animals tail can be another distinguishing feature The tail of a jaguar is typically shorter than the tail of a leopard A jaguars tail patterns are also unique the rosette patterns on the tail may appear to merge forming a band around the tail Though jaguars and leopards have very similarlooking coats there are some noticeable differences between the two Close examination of the patterns and coloration can often reveal which animal is whichWhile both animals have rosette patterns on their coats a leopards rosettes are solid A jaguars coat will have spots inside the rosettes setting it apart from those of a leopard The rosettes on a jaguars coat are usually much larger whereas a leopards rosettes are typically very closelyspaced togetherA jaguars base coat color is usually a shade of yellow but it can also be reddishbrown or even darker The throat outer legs underbelly and lower flanks are usually white though they may have spotsBoth animals can have an allblack coat but a black leopard will still show a rosette pattern on its black coat A black jaguars coloration can also appear more like a mix of blueblack and purple
If youâre not used to taking care of yourself itâs a good reason to start improving something about yourself First of all try not to look messy or sloppy itâs a huge turnoff for any guy unless he doesnt mind it Abandon that old dusty pair of jeans and huge Tshirt for something more flattering Wear something that makes you feel confident    Have a sense of style Okay you may not be the kind of girl who pampers herself all day long but dont be afraid to take fashion risks Do you like bright colors Show him just how fabulous you are Express your individuality with earrings scarves or whatever makes you feel pretty Dont worry about fitting in youre a trend setter Dont go overboard with sexy clothing Show him you are beautiful without having to give away all the goods Sexy is good Trashy is risky  Everyone likes the girl who acts like a tom boy but dont let the boys forget that you are also a lovely woman Say kind things to him laugh at his jokes make him feel like hes awesome Itll get him asking for your number for sure   Dont try to impress him by cussing like a sailor Remember act like a lady Speak to him in gentle tones Remind him of how feminine you can be  Compliment guys An honest compliment can go a long way If you like somebody compliment them on the particularities you like about them Dont compliment them too much or gush Act romantic and sensitive Let guys know you need to get affection Sometimes if you dont tell them directly they may even forget you have feelings too Speak your mind    Even if guys often donât understand friendships between girls they will respect you if you show them you have friends of your own Dont be afraid to show your social independence   Girls little secrets are fascinating for guys Dont give away too much information you want to keep that boy wanting more   Mean girls may be popular but they often end up alone Believe it or not guys find cat fights quite scary and theyll back off when they see how mean you can be at times Theres nothing wrong with being nice Surely you can stand up for yourself without being mean right
You shouldnt change yourself for a guy because then he will like the fake you and not the real you and thats not good That is taking the wrong direction Dont go there Do whatever you feel like doing and act however you feel like acting Dart if you feel like If you usually pick your nose pick your nose Wear what you like say what you like act how you like Do whatever you feel like If youre genuinely a quiet calm serious sort of person be like that If you are really kinda crazy be crazy If he doesnt like you for who you are hes not worth it  He would rather see your face and real body then all that fake glob on your face and clothes that show your body off Its okay to put on some makeup maybe even a little blush or something else whatever you want but  dont use what you feel is too much Its for your own good He wont see the real you if you put fake stuff on you when your really beautiful inside and out Do not care what other people think of you say about you or anyone who doesnt like you in a mean way Again if he doesnt like you for who you are he is not worth it   A guy is not going to like you right away just because he sees you walking in the hall to class Try to get him to catch you glancing at him at least a few times  Get him to stare at you through sheer willpower   As said earlier if you arent the bold chatty type who finds it easy to talk to guys dont do this as you wont be being yourself if you talk to boys just to get another guy to be jealous when you wouldnt normally When around him such as lunch in the halls or before and after school let him start seeing you either talking to another guy flirting with another guy staring at another guy or just with guy friends in general Before you do that be sure he knows that you know he is around by force of will Dont glance at him as you do this He may think youre trying to make him jealous and thats a turnoff   For example say youre in lunch and he sees you with friends Do a dance move randomly if you are the kind of person that does this normally or go to a guy and put your arm around him Do something like similar to this Other ways to make them want your attention include having something noticeably in common Notice what hes into and if you are into it too advertise that If you have a band teeshirt he does wear it If you have a book youve noticed him reading let him see you reading your copy or something similar Wear his favourite sports teams colours or some supporters gear carry your binder decorated with Greenpeace symbols if he has one take your flute to school if he plays flute or join the chess club if hes in it Look for things you like that he likes and use them to make a connection Again do not change yourself for him   This will just mess you up unless you are being true to yourself doing so Lots of people are conceited do think they are all that and believe that they are incredibly popular when they actually arent If thats you dont change be yourself   Be nice to him if the opportunity arises even though you dont know home Be polite hold the door for him say hi let him go in front of you in a queue these acts are about all you can do with a boy you dont know and hardly see Also smile Happy girls are the prettiest   Dont notice him and let him see you with other guys as much as possible Hell be eating out the palm of your hand in no time
If you want to show that you are interested in someone you need to show that person that you are interested in the things he or she says Even minor details like the name of a pet or a childhood phobia should be recalled and dropped into conversation from time to time   If you have a hard time dropping details like this into conversation naturally remember habits and demonstrate your recollection by appealing to these habits For instance if your crush orders the same drink without fail order it for him or her before your crush shows upYou should also remember the obvious things birthdays things you spoke about in your last conversation and so on  When you are with the apple of your eye focus solely on that person and that person alone Do not text other people or look around for other friends Make sure that your full attention is on your crush   Find excuses to meet your crushs friends or close relatives These are the people he or she loves If you want to be among their ranks you will need to demonstrate an interest in them first   Another important way to work your way into that persons life is to open up as many channels of communication as possible Get a phone number and call or text occasionally You should never become a pest about it but the occasional âgood morningâ âgood nightâ or âwhat are you up toâ text will let that special someone know that he or she is on your mind Likewise you should also casually invite this person into your own life Introduce him or her to your friends If your family is doing something fun that your crush might enjoy consider extending an invitation   You can be as kind as possible to this person but it still wont be enough to convey your interest if you are naturally the same way to everyone else You do not need to be nasty to other people but you should definitely treat this person with more care and attention than you give to others More importantly make it obvious to him or her that this is the case   For instance if you notice that your crushs plate or glass is empty offer to fill it Go out of your way to perform other random acts of kindness for the person you favor Give your crush a greeting card or a favorite candy bar if you know that he or she is having a rough day   No matter how busy you are if you want to let your crush know that you are interested you need to make it a point to hang out from time to time   Similarly you should purposefully seek them out when you are at a group event like a party Make sure to convey your desire to spend time with this person even when in the midst of a crowd of others Text or email back as soon as you get this persons messages even if you do not do that with other people   If you stumble across something that makes you think of the other person send an email or text to tell them about it By showing that you think of your crush even when he or she is not around you are demonstrating just how often that person is on your mind   Similarly if you go a few days without seeing this person send a quick âI miss youâ message Wait for days or events when you might usually see them thoughâlike a party they were invited to and couldnt attend   Locking eyes for three seconds can speak volumes especially if you conclude by slowly dragging your eyes away   Eye contact has even greater impact if you get caught staring at person you are interested in Make sure that when you get caught however you quickly look away In doing so you let him or her know that you were just caught in the act and not merely staring into space One thing to avoid doing of course is staring the other person down Eye contact conveys a certain level of intimacy and flirtatiousness when done right When overdone though you can quickly intimidate someone and ruin your chances for good   When you greet the object of your affection smile Smile while talking to him or her Smile when you part ways There is something warm and friendly about a smile and wielding one whenever your crush is around will help convey just how happy you are about the interaction you have   Another great thing about a smile is that it really demonstrates the excitement you feel whenever you find yourself around this person A smile that flashes your pearly whites and makes your eyes sparkle will leave very little room for doubt in the other persons mind   You do not need to dress up every time you see him or her but as a general rule put in a minimum amount of effort to look good Showing that you care about how you look in front of this person will hint at the fact that you have a reason to care about such things   On a similar note if your crush specifically said that a particular piece of jewelry or garment looked nice on you wear it frequently In doing so you can show that you really value how that person views you   Find excuses to make brief subtle touches A casual touch on the arm or knee while you talk can work wonders Even these seemingly innocent forms of touch convey a sense of intimacy and by initiating them you are telling the other person that you want to be close   Every time you touch this person you should use a very gentle light touch A hearty pat on the back can be a friendly sign but it does not do much to convey romantic interest If possible move in for a hug when you greet or say goodbye as well This form of physical contact is often reserved for people who are close so it could help bridge the gap between you both If you do hug when you say goodbye make sure that your hug lingers Do not let go immediately instead let your hands linger before hesitantly sliding them away This move will show that you are reluctant to say your farewells More precisely touch areas of the body that seem innocent while also hinting at intimacy Touch your face or hair or slowly stroke your own arm a bit Use your tongue to moisten your lips every now and then By touching yourself in ways like these you can hint to the other person that you really wish they were touching you instead   You need to make sure that you do not seem too suggestive or creepy when you do this though Act like your selftouching is subconscious and casual rather than making it obvious that it is entirely for his or her benefit One of the worst things you can do is to have your hands all over yourself while staring the other person down with a hungry look in your eyes   Another great way to demonstrate how interested in you are in someone is to demonstrate an active interest in learning more about that person Ask anything you can think of as long as you avoid questions that might make him or her uncomfortable   Ask your crush how his or her day was Ask about family friends dreams interestsâthere are a wide range of topics when you really stop to think about it If a certain topic makes him or her obviously uncomfortable drop it It may have been an innocent question at first and most people will forgive you for accidentally stumbling onto one of their landmines If you persistently drag that topic up afterward though you can make yourself into a nuisance and a bully quickly   This can be a bit tricky since there is a fine line between teasing gently and teasing mercilessly but if you pull it off it can have a lot of impact Playfully tease your crush about unimportant things like being late or having bed hair Never tease about points of insecurity though   You may not want to tell this person how you feel in direct terms but you should drop some pretty obvious hints from time to time to let him or her know that you really do like being around them   Tell him or her flat out that you enjoyed the time you spent together Try something simple like I had a great time talking with you tonight We should do it again soon This might seem fairly blunt but unless you spit it out the other party might find ways of doubting your reactions Leave no room for such doubtsMaster the art of casual compliments Let the object of your affections know how stunning they look today or sigh in amazement when they solve a difficult problem Show how much they impress you   This can be difficult of course since inside jokes are usually things that happen naturally Once you have something that counts though bring it up frequently Doing so shows just how much you value that bit of connection between the two of you   There is something intrinsically appealing about hearing your own name being called and the other person is likely to appreciate it if you make an effort to say his or her name several times during your conversations   You should also consider coming up with a nickname Nicknames express a special sort of connection between two people especially if you use a nickname that no one else uses with that person Once you settle on a nickname make sure to actually use it   Make a habit of turning to this person for advice or helpful opinions whenever you have a choice to make By asking for advice you can demonstrate that you are interested in what this person thinks   Ask for advice on everything from movie recommendations to solving disputes you have at work or with other friends You should balance both serious and lighthearted matters
Look for physical cues that may indicate how she feels about you Postures and motions may reflect what she is thinking and feeling and provide insight into how you should act around her Some possible body language cues may includeIf she mirrors your movements she is likely intrigued by you If she plays with her hair she is likely trying to get or keep your attention If she dangles a shoe off her foot it is a sign that she is comfortable with you If she locks eyes with you for several consecutive seconds it likely means that she wants the interaction to go further   Ask her what she likes to do in her spare time and if she has any regular hobbies Hobbies can tell you a lot about a personâs creativity social life talents and passions To really get to know her ask to join her for a class excursion or event to experience her favorite hobby firsthandFor instance ask if you can join her for a bike ride or yoga class   A personâs favorite music is closely linked to their personality so knowing what she listens to may give you more insight into who she is Ask her who her favorite bands or artists are or look for any preferences she might have listed on her social media accounts Use a digital streaming service to preview or download songs or albums that she likes and listen to them on your own or with her Understanding someones relationship with their loved ones can provide a great deal of insight into who they are Inquire about her family and friends indirectly by asking who the most influential people in her life are How she answers the question ie who she mentions and how she talks about them will tell you a great deal about her life
If he is constantly staring at you or in your direction it may be because he has a crush on you Try to pay attention to the difference between a normal stare when having a conversation versus a more intense lustful glare A lot of eye contact is one way he will try to gain your interest and get you to notice himWhen you catch him looking at you see if he pretends to look somewhere else This is a good sign he has a crush Try standing out of his sight to see if he moves in a way where he can see you again For example if you two are talking in a group of people stand behind someone so he cant see you Then watch to see if he positions himself in a new spot that allows him to see you  If he tries to stand close to you at parties or sits next to you at lunch chances are he has a major crush on you This is his way of getting as physically close to you as he can to express how he cares and enjoys being near you   People express their emotions with their body language and that includes hands Girls are known to flip their hair or gently touch the shoulder or hand of the person they are crushing on Guys tend to talk more with their hands when talking to girls they have a crush on because they are excited   If he blushes around you laughs uncontrollably for almost no reason cant look you in the eye or fidgets a lot then you have your answer These are all telltale signs of someone who is crushing A common sign of attraction can be shown through imitation When people do this they do not even realize it Watch for someone using common words or catch phrases you say or talking about things you are interested in to relate with you more
If you do nothing else remember thisyou should shower regularly and brush your teeth No girl is going to want to cozy up to a guy who has stuff in his teeth and smells like BO Bust out that greatsmelling body wash and deodorant and start thinking of your toothbrush as your best friend Of course there are plenty of other things you can do to get her attention with your wellgroomed looks   Going beyond the basics Find a cologne that will make girls swoon wash your face so that your skin is blemish free add a little bit of styling gel to your hair to get that âI just got out of bed but Iâm so manly that I just look this good all the timeâ lookthe possibilities are endless If its going to make you smell good look good and feel good itâs probably something you should try Considering body hair Clip that nose hair and pluck that unibrow If youâre rocking some facial hair props to you Just make sure to keep it in checkits generally better to have no beard than a flowing âIâve just been asleep for 100 yearsâ Rip Van Winkle look Clipping your nails Do it You donât want to be thinking about holding her hand only to cut her with your talons when you make a move While youâre at it scrape that dirt out from under there   This doesnât mean going out and buying a whole new wardrobe but you should definitely give your wardrobe some consideration Ditch any articles of clothing that are stained or torn Everyone has their own stylebut âslobâ style is definitely the least attractive Donât wear the same shirt every day of the week and try to put a bit more effort into your outfit instead of just throwing on a sweatshirt and sweatpants   Play up your style Whether you are a hipster jock or have some style all your own put a little effort into what you wear in the morning   Believe it or not your posture actually plays a big part in how girls perceive you If you have a tendency to hunch avoid eye contact and play with your hands a girl is going to be less inclined to come over and strike up a conversation Stand up straight keep your eyes up and get a smile goingyou will look much more approachable   Keep in mind that while you really should have good posture you should also carry yourself with ease Standing up straight does not mean walking around like a robot or holding yourself so rigidly that you look like Frankenstein If you donât know how to carry yourself with ease draw inspiration from movies or TV Watch how the lead guy holds himself and eventually charms his way into the lead girlâs heart   While this does not mean that you have to lift for your life you should keep in mind that if you want to get that drop dead gorgeous girl to notice you youâre going to have to keep your physique in mind She puts effort into her looks so you should too Start an exercise routine that combines both cardio and weighttraining for an all around toned look   Keep in mind that most girls like a guy who looks fit but not one that has muscles that are about to rip through his tshirt every time he raises his arm in class If your goal is to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was Mr Universe you may want to tone it back a bit
You will have the highest chances of success dating on vacation if you plan for it well in advance Look up the customs and social norms of the culture youre visiting and work on your charm Although a lot of this is easier said than done it can be accomplished with the right degree of selfawareness Go out and be social in your own area first dont wait for a vacation to turn on the charm   Dont throw money at socalled pickup artists and dating coaches Although some of the basic information may be helpful its seldom worth the exorbitant rates many of the coaches charge for their services   Although your dress should be relatively casual and applicable to the vacation setting you should emphasize appearance over pure comfort   A collared shirt and dress shoes work well for the majority of cases   No matter what stay busy during your vacation Although some people take a vacation as an opportunity to laze about youll only have a realistic chance of meeting new people when youre out actively doing things Check the weekly schedule for the resort youre staying at Read up on the events that are happening nearby If your resort has a bar or club check it out and see whats going on Just about any event will provide an opportunity to meet women so you should take up any opportunity when it presents itself   Check out party events in the areaParties entail a highenergy environment thats perfect for meeting single women Meeting women during the day increases your chances as opposed to the night Because people will be relaxing throughout the day while on vacation youll have more time to spend with a girl than if you were saving your advances purely for the night Most guys will only approach at night which also has the effect of increasing your competition You should be honest and authentic Even if a prospect doesnt share your postal code shell most likely be able to tell if youre being disingenuous towards her   This includes lots of smiling Just make sure not to stare at one girl for too long This runs the risk of being interpreted as creepiness   For instance if you have a decent grasp of magic tricks using playing cards you can approach a group of girls and ask if they would like to see a trick Some girls may even approach you for a cigarette if they see you smoking   Sunscreen is also handy as most vacationers will be in want of it if theyre spending much time on the beach
Physical attraction is often the first step in developing a crush Donât feel shallow for initially being drawn to someone because you like how tall they are or because their eyes make you swoonWhen it comes to attraction humans have biological impulsesLook around you at work or at school If someone makes your heart flutter on first sight try to meet them Find excuses to spend time around them like asking them to help you with a school or work project Donât discount people because they arenât your âtypeâ Sometimes crushes come in the least expected packages so dont lose opportunity by being closeminded   Not all crushes come out of initial physical attraction Look at the friends and acquaintances you already have Who do you find yourself wanting to spend the most time with Have you ever had an inkling of something more than friendship with any of them   Look for the laughs Genuine and frequent laughter is often a good sign of initial compatibility If someone makes you smile itâs worth a lot If you know a friend has a crush on you but youâre not sure if youâre physically attracted to the person ask yourself some questions about the emotional side of things Try writing a list of all the things you like about that person Ask yourself how the list makes you feel Often as emotional attraction grows physical attraction follows  Itâs simpleâif you donât put yourself into new situations you wonât meet new people Try attending events and joining activities that reflect your interests This will help you meet likeminded people and give you an automatic conversation starter  Itâs not for everyone but itâs an undeniable part of dating today Online dating can be an easy way to break the ice and find people with similar interests If you use online dating be sure to meet in person as soon as you can Thereâs no substitute for body language in conversion and youâll be able to determine if the spark is really there   Research dating sites Like dating in real life different dating sites are right for different people They all offer different types of services and levels of customization Donât overlook social media Social media can be a great way to reconnect with old flames or old friends or to meet new people It takes some of the risk out of online dating Through someoneâs social media profile you can see a slightly less curated version of their lives and check if you have mutual friends or interests Sending a quick personal message is painless and thereâs no pressure for the other person to respond if they arenât interested   Sometimes crushes are unavoidable Know when you should let your crush in on your attraction or keep it to yourself   If your crush is in a relationship of any kind let it go Period You donât want to break up your crush and their significant other and chances are they wonât return your feelings Even if they do itâs sure to become messy quickly It should go with out saying but only approach good people If you have any knowledge that your crush has done or said something violent cruel or illegal run in the other direction No matter how romanticized in books and movies the âbad girlâ or âbad boyâ never makes for a good partner If you do like a friend make sure itâs worth the risk Letting a friend know you want more out of the friendship might lead to awkwardness or distance Make a pros and cons list and think about how this specific person might respond if they donât return your feelings  If you decide your crush is worthy of your attention begin with small gestures of attention This way you can clue them in on your feelings without scaring them away   Invite them to group events You donât have to start out asking your date to a romantic dinner for two Try inviting them to casual hangouts with your friends You can show them how fun you are in a social setting without the pressure of private conversation Extend an openended invitation For example if you find out this person likes sushi say something like âWe should get sushi sometimeâ If they say âyesâ it leaves it up to them to make the actual plans and if they never follow up they probably werenât truly interested Use body language When youâre hanging out give them a small touch on the arm or sit slightly closer to them than you would one of your friends Gauge their physical reaction to your closeness If they return these small gestures unconsciously chances are good that they like you too Simple flirting can help you win over your crush Flirting doesnt have to be stressful or complicatedAdd emojis If youre texting try adding just a few smiley faces to your messages to let your crush know that talking to them makes you smile Tease him a little Dont be mean but little bit of playful teasing can go a long way Use your eyes Let him catch you staring and quickly look away   Being shy can make talking to your crush that much more difficultWork on your confidence so you can approach your crush   Its okay to be nervous Dont try too hard to hide it Your crush will think its sweet Focus on your crush not yourself Think about all the great things about them Shyness often begins when you are too focused on your own insecurities Start with a common interest Talk about something you love and are very familiar with This will help you avoid awkward pauses Text Communicating through texts can be a great way for a shy person to get to know someone It will help you become comfortable and make it easier to talk in person   After you have hinted your affections subtly for a while let your crush know how you feel Donât think you have to wait for your crush to make the first big move Keep your statement short and simple   Donât feel like you have to initiate in person Write a quick note or send a text message after a hang out sessions After this invite them to do something that is clearly a date Say something like âI have really enjoyed getting to know you better Would you want to go out to dinner with me on Thursdayâ Keep it simple and specific   If someone doesnât respond to your flirting or rejects you outright let them go Donât dwell on what you could have done differently and donât try to change their mind At this stage in the relationship take what your crush says at face value Look at a ânoâ as an opportunity to meet someone even better Remember this will take time Donât be discouraged if you continue to have feelings for your crush Just do your best to interact with new people and donât be tempted to continue trying to flirt with your crush Let yourself be sad Itâs fine to take a day or a week to wallow a little Vent to your friends Treat yourself to a nice meal   If youâve been flirting with your crush for a while but youâre still not sure whether or not they return your feelings it can help to ask friends Try to ask friends who know your crush fairly well Sometimes an objective opinion can help you understand what someone really feels   If your friends think your crush is interested it may be time to be more blunt with your crush about their feelings Just ask them like this âHey I have a confession to make I have been really crushing on you lately Just wondering if maybe you felt the sameâ   If your crush returns your feelings let yourself enjoy the moment Keep flirting and keep things lighthearted for a while Donât feel pressured to progress into the serious stage of a relationship too quickly

Pay attention to what your crush does for fun People generally enjoy talking about things that they know and like Look for common ground between you two for topics to discuss   For example find out what their extra curriculars are or what they do on the weekends You can ask their friends or just pay attention to what they say theyre doing  Are they shy Maybe they are very social and extroverted Taking cues from his or her social interactions will give you an idea of how to eventually approach your crush   For example if theyre shy talking to them around other people or being very open with your affection may scare them and this should be avoided   You can only have a conversation if you are both in the same place at the same time This information will increase the likelihood that you will have an impromptu runin with your crush   If simply paying attention doesnt help you can always recruit one of their friends to help you out Good friends will want to help their friend get a boyfriend or girlfriend Just make sure theyre trustworthy   You want to look you best to show your crush that you think theyre worth the effort Feeling comfortable with your outward appearance will also give you an extra boost of confidence Take special care with   Hair  Get a fresh haircut or style your hair in a nice way Dont go for a totally new hairstyle thoughit will look out of place

long way Check out information on grooming here   Depending on what you learned about your crush choosing the when and the where of your conversation could be very important If you want to have an intimate oneonone conversation start the conversation when your crush is alone If you are in a group or in a loud location the conversation can be more casual   Speak clearly and make eye contact with your crush Your body language says much about your interest A smile wouldnt hurt either   Remember that they are just another person just like you You dont have to be nervous and even if things dont go exactly as you plan everything will still be okay in the end   These are questions that cant be answered with a simple yes or no The goal is to get them talking and keep them talking because this will give you the most opportunities to have something to respond to creating a real conversation   Open questions usually start with why or how or deal with complex subject matters For example you could ask What was it like growing up in New York and then having to move here Why did you want to take this class or How are you liking working with _____   Try asking followup questions on topics that your crush seemed genuinely interested in Tone of voice and body language can give you an idea of how the conversation is going   If they seem very disinterested or distracted quit while youre ahead You dont want to give them the impression that youre super awkward Just excuse yourself Sorry I forgot I was supposed to call my Aunt for her birthday and try again another time   Once the conversation gets rolling express your opinions and interests while giving your crush space to express theirs Just make sure that youre focusing the conversation on them in the early stages of getting to know each other You dont want them to feel like youre selfcentered   You can start a conversation by talking about what youre guaranteed to have in common school or work depending on how you know each other   Have you taken Math with Heiser Im trying to figure out if I want to take it next semester Did you hear that theyre going to remodel the break room Im holding out for a new TV What about you   You can also comment on something thats happening nearby while youre standing near each other Just be sure it isnt critical of or insulting to other people since this will give your crush the wrong impression of what youre like   Did you see that I wish more people were considerate like that these days Its so nice to see Such a shame how hes talking to her She deserves more respect She works really hard   Comment on something that theyre wearing asking a question about its origin or story Try to look for things that theyre clearly proud of such as badge pins nice shoes or tee shirts with band logos   Thats a cool Burning Man tee Have you ever gone Ive always wanted to go Sweet Adventure Time button Whos your favorite character   Ask them a question about something that you think they might know about This is a good way to get yourself talking to them but the subject will usually need to be changed pretty quickly if you want a conversation to keep going   Do you know where the Smith Building is Do you know how to open this Ive been struggling with it but I cant tell if Im dumb or just have really weak wrists   Ask them for a tiny favor something that takes less than a minute of their time People like to feel useful and it will give you a way to start a conversation with positive feelings   I dont suppose you could help me reach the stuff on the upper shelf None of these chairs are safe to stand on Can you hold this coffee for a second while I put this away I dont want it to spill   Ask them about how or why theyre in a specific place For example if youre at a party ask how they know the host If youre at school and just hanging out in class or with other friends ask them if theyve always lived in the area   Talk about something thats happening in the news either nationally or in your local area This can be a good way to launch into more serious topics if youre really wanting to get to know them as a person   Did you hear about that protest rally for this weekend I was thinking about going Did you hear the city is planning on tearing down that highway Traffic is going to be murder   Comment on or ask about a recent movie or TV show either one that you like a lot or one that you havent see yet Get their opinion and use it to launch into a conversation Even if they havent seen it you can turn the conversation into a usable topic   Have you gone to see the new Spider Man yet Im trying to figure out if its worth seeing Oh man please tell me you watch Game of Thrones because I need someone to be excited with You dont You shouldits awesome etc   A compliment about something notcreepy is a great way to start a conversation Try to compliment them on something they control like their clothing choice or something theyve done or made instead of something that they dont like their hair or eyes Complimenting things like hair or eyes might as well be a compliment for just about anyone and isnt unique to them   Just tell them that you want to talk to them because they look interesting or fun and you want to get to know them Many people will appreciate the honesty especially people who are on the attractive side and are used to people trying to be manipulative or coy in order to talk to them
If you find yourself at a party or an event with her you should try to make eye contact Although you donât want to stare at her in a creepy way you should make eye contact with her to show your interest and hopefully strike up a conversation Although you may feel too nervous to approach her out of the blue you could express your interest in her by writing a short note Use a nice pen or pencil Write a short note and pass it to her at the end of class or after a shift at workIf you are writing a note in class you should try to give it to her directly If you have a business card you could write your note on it   If there is an opportunity for you to show your support for her you should take it Attend any performances she might be giving such as dance recitals concerts and theatrical performances It is a great chance to learn more about her meet some of her friends and express your feelings for herIf she is performing a concert and shared a group invite with you on social media go and show your support Donât go to her performances or events if you are not invited She may get the impression that you are a creep so stick to the events that she actually invites you to attend   If you are at a bar or a coffee shop try to remember what she orders The next time you are at the establishment with her you could order her the drink before she has a chance Sheâll likely be surprised and touched that you remembered and may get the hint that you like herWhen she is in line at the coffee shop you could jot down a note of her drink order It could also be a mental note If she goes to the bar to get a drink you could go with her and listen to her order The next time she needs a drink youâll know what to order
Its normal to feel upset and a little heartbroken when your crush rejects you but anger will not help anything Getting angry can be particularly damaging if your crush is a close friend as getting mad may ruin the friendshipWish your crush good luck and try to smile If you wereare close friends let your crush know youd like to remain friends and that you hope this wont change things between you Its the best way to save face and maintain the friendship after getting rejected  One of the best ways to get over heartbreak and rejection is to surround yourself with friends Whether you go to a movie get food go out for a drink if youre old enough or just hang out at home its important to be with friends during difficult situationsLet your friends know youre going through a rough patch and ask them if theyre free to spend some time together Some friends will make the effort to reach out to you but other friends may need to be invited If your friends dont immediately reach out to you try approaching them and let them know that you could really use some company If youre feeling the sting of a crushs rejection it can be helpful to seek out activities that make you happy Whether you enjoy listening to music reading a book watching a movie or simply going for a walk or bike ride doing things you enjoy can help you feel good and stay positive in spite of how youre feeling Some people may assume that journaling wont help but studies have shown that journaling can help people put their thoughts into perspective and remain positive after experiencing heartbreak  Invest in a new highquality journal This will ensure that the journal will stand up to any abuse from daily use and will make you more likely to want to use your journal every daySet aside time everyday to write in your journal Try setting a timer to force yourself to write for longer periods of timeAllow yourself to experiment Your journal isnt intended to be read by anyone else so let yourself be open and honest Give yourself permission to think things through on the page as youre figuring it out In other words it doesnt have to be a perfectly thoughtout and wellarticulated document It can just be a jumble of thoughts feelings or observations Maybe you were rejected in front of a group of people and youre feeling embarrassed or perhaps you just had really high hopes that things would work out with someone Whatever youre going through dont be afraid to talk about how youre feeling if youre really devastated over a rejection If you dont think your friends or family would understand try talking to a counselor or therapistMany schools and universities offer free counselors or you can search online to find a therapist in your area   Its natural to feel a little hurt after getting rejected but its important that you dont let yourself become afraid of rejection in the future That kind of fear and avoidance are part of catastrophizing which involves assuming that one experience is part of a larger more serious patternRemember that even though rejection may be inconvenient and even painful it is not a horrible lifeordeath situationKeep in mind that rejection is never permanent New opportunities will always present themselves eventually Many people respond to rejection by internalizing it Its easy to feel that someones rejection is a reflection of your own worth but its simply not true Youve no doubt had crushes on some people and not had feelings about others and it has nothing to do with how attractive or interesting or likable that person is Much of it boils down to compatibility Other times a person may just not be ready for a relationship Whatever the reason it does not reflect on youNever let someone elses approval or rejection define your own worth Remember that you are wonderful just the way you are Yes its unfortunate that your crush didnt feel the same way about you and its probably a little painful However its just one person and that person wasnt right for you Try to think of rejection as an opportunity to find a better situation with someone who will feel the same way about youIf your crush didnt think youd be compatible together that just means that theres someone else out there with whom youll be even more compatible   If your crush rejected you its possible you were more attracted to their appearance than their personality Whatever the circumstances of your rejection were now would be a good time to be honest with yourself and determine what you want from an ideal partnerThink about traits you would want from an ideal partner Perhaps you want someone who is warm and caring or maybe trustworthiness is more important to you Shared interests or worldview is also a common trait people seek in a partner Whatever it is that you think you want from a partner figure it out before you start having feelings for anyone else While ideal partner preferences shape the type of person you actively seek out you also have an unspoken emotional reaction to most people you meet Sometimes were blinded by our emotional reaction to someone because of their looks or charming personality but its important to learn to recognize the emotional reaction you feel in someones presence  Emotional reactions are typically unconscious and you cant change that reaction But as you analyze your emotions over time perhaps through journaling you can learn to recognize the emotional reaction that you have to a person Even if someone has traits that you find ideal and you have a positive emotional reaction to that person you may simply not be a good match when it comes to longterm compatibility Learning how to evaluate a crush for real meaningful compatibility can be the difference between frustrating relationship problems and a meaningful fulfilling partnershipThink about the personality traits you find most desirable Do you have a type Does that type typically work well with you Or are you only seeing the surface of people you have a crush onTrust your gut If you find someone attractive but dont have much in common with them it probably wont work out and you probably already know this Learn to trust your gut as you evaluate potential partners as this will help you avoid getting hurt and rejected in the future
You may feel disappointed sad or even rejected These are all perfectly normal feelings to have They may last for a little while but they will fade Express your sadness in healthy ways Let yourself be upset and even cryLet it out and then promise yourself to let it goDonât tell a bunch of friends though For example donât text your friends about what your crush said or did today Kids sometimes tease other kids who have crushesTry writing down your thoughts in a journal at home andor listening to music You may want to choose one best friend who you really trust to keep a secret Whoever you choose to talk to about your crush when you are done venting ask that person to stop you if you start talking about your crush after you decided to let it go   Your parents are adults and their judgment is fully developed You can trust and confide in them more than you can trust your classmates because your parents are more mature and want you to live well Help them to relate to what youâre going throughTry saying âCan you hear me out and be nonjudgmental I would like someone to talk toâ Ask something like âWhat mistakes did you make as tweens and teenagersâ and âWhat did you learnâ This will help remind them of what they went through and how they felt at your age If they canât think of any mistakes try asking something else to open up the conversation like âHow about any funny stories from when you were my about my ageâTry asking âWho was your first crushâ Ask what your limits are when it comes to socializing with guys outside of school hours It might not matter if your crush doesnât like you back if youâre not allowed to date yet Try not to get mad or defensive at your parentsâ answers â remember that are guiding you out of loveTry asking âAm I allowed to go to the movies with a group of friends that includes a guy Am I allowed to go on oneonone datesâ   Middle school relationships usually last just a few weeksThink about this imagine that he did like you and you got your hopes up only to be broken up with twelve days later That would have be bad for your selfesteemYou wonât have to deal with peer pressure to do anything youâre not ready for yetWhen you break up with someone in middle school you still have to see them in class which can be very uncomfortableYou arenât really ready for a relationship yet Your mind and body are still growing and so are your classmates If a guy approaches you and says that he likes you and wants to date you try saying âThanks for thinking of me but I need to focus on my studiesâ
Love and infatuation are two different things Love involves commitment and compatibility Before you can find this kind of love even in someone you are infatuated with you should learn to love yourself Loving yourself means that you do not have to look for love or affirmation in someone else to feel good about yourself You know that you are worth loving You are not looking for a partner to make you complete because you are already enough  If you do not love yourself and need to heal from something you may want to try to sort through it on your own before you get into a serious relationship Consider seeing a therapist who can teach you how to take steps toward healthy self love  If you love someone you work to support their passions and strengths You also acknowledge and accept the weaknesses of that person Love does not ignore the other personâs flaws but works to help that person grow and work through their problems   Make sure the other person complements you as well Before you commit to a longterm relationship find someone who challenges and brings out the best in you   Real love looks for opportunities to do things for the person they love The more shared positive experiences and hard work that the people in the relationship can share the stronger the attachment security and trust that will be built into that relationship   Do small things for your partner Wash your partners dishes leave a note for your partner or buy them their favorite candy Do big things for and with your partner Take off the weekend to do something special together plan a birthday party for your partner or take a class together Do things that require more time effort and love   This means that you both are focused on making things work for your relationship You donât work for your own wants or needs instead you focus on the good of your shared life For example instead of watching your favorite TV show alone rent a movie and buy popcorn Spend the evening enjoying each other and having real conversations
If he jokes around with you then he may like you however he just might like to mess with other people too When you are sitting at lunch pay attention to see if he is messing with you just to be funny or if he is trying to be funny and friendly If he   Is extremely nice to you never puts you down       Walks with you in the halls on your way to classes Acts shy  For example he might list all the sports he plays how much he can do of something or continually say how good he is at something Again this may be a part of the way he is around everyone Try to figure out if he is taking extraordinary measures to build himself up in your eyes   He might kick your chair talk loudly or act clumsy These are all signs that something is up and he has an interest in you   If he is making an effort to sit or stand up straight then he may like you If he may be pulling his shirt down playing with his hat you can assume it means he is shy and thinks youre pretty If he stands up for you all the time and is overprotective then he may like you   This is the simplest and most direct way to find out This takes a confident person unless you already are perfectly confident Youll also have to be able to handle it if he doesnt like you especially if you like him   By asking himher just to ask them or observe them further   This is something that is very important to look for If he does stare at you try to see what kind of a stare it is Is it a stare like he is lost in his thoughts or is it a stare meaning he thinks youre weird Sometimes his eyes can say everything   Do his pupils dilate when he looks at you Sometimes if a boy likes you his pupils will dilate Not many people pay attention to this but sometimes it can be a sign that he is crushing on you   Do his cheeks turn any shade of pink or red around you When you two are having a simple chat in the hall try to see what color his cheeks are Do they turn an unusual pink or red around you or do they stay their normal color If they are not their normal color it could be a sign that he is nervous around you and is afraid of embarrassing himself   Slightly look at him if he walks past you or are in lessons and see if he is looking at you Notice his reaction when he realizes hes been caught If he blushes or turns away quickly its a definite sign he is into you but dont be upset if he doesnt react because some guys like to act cool and make it seem they werent looking at you at all   Does he ever try to gently shove or touch you If he does this he could just be friendly or he could be trying to make an excuse to get closer to you   Does he ever hug you for no reason Making physical contact is a sign that he likes you         This usually means he is just being friendly but if he does it often it may mean that he wants to make an excuse for you two to get closer   If he panics more than your other guy friends would when you cry its a sign Ever had those kind of days where nothing seems to be going right and you break into tears Pay attention to his reaction Does he ask whats wrong and whowhat caused it and tries hard to make you laugh or at least smile If he does any of this more often than your other guy friends it means he cares about you and likes you   Have you ever talked to him about a TV show or a video game and a week later he is hooked on it It means he is either really into the same things as you or he wants you to like him more   Does he ever try to sit by you in class If your class does not have certain seating arrangements does he try his best every day to sit near you   Has he asked for your phone number yet and does he text you a lot If he hasnt got your number no problem it might mean he is shy or nervous   Have you ever caught him glaringnarrowing his eyes at a boy you talk to He might be jealous of other guys around you   Look at his expression when you are talking to other guys Does he look angry or act moody or even comes and interrupts you when you are talking   Do his friends laugh at him and look at you like they know something you should know This can be a dead giveaway It is usually the friends that let the boys crush find out he likes them Try to look for that when you walk near   Do they a giggle and nudge your crush and make lovey dovey noises or smirk at him Does he hang around your friends a lot This may mean he wants to get closer to your friends to help him find out more about you
Tell her that youre flattered that she seems to to like you but that youre not in a place to date anyone right now Help her to understand that this means youre busy and emotionally unavailable Some good excuses include   Im really focused in worksports try outs etc right now School comes first  Hopefully shell leave you alone If she does not continue with the remaining steps   Whenever she tries to come near you pretend like you cannot see her there and talk right through her to your buddies This might break her heart but thats what you want right   A smile will always be interpreted as encouragement   Never answer her messages not even to say youre not interested thats an acknowledgment of reading it and that gives her too big an angle   This will increase her hope and it will be too easy to put a false slant on your enthusiasm   If she persists and seems nice enough match her with someone else
If you want someone to be attracted to you the real you in a lasting way youll need to be attractive first You do this by being the best possible version of yourself bringing out all the qualities about you that are good and taking problems head on          Learn fun skills Learn the sort of fun skills that you always wanted to have This will make you happy but it will also make you more interesting to other people Passion and talent is attractive and this will go a long way towards making other people like you Help others No one wants to be with a real jerk Show your crush that you are a kind wonderful person by helping others You can help your friends and the people around you or you can help your community by volunteering Relax Be funny Have a good sense of humor Dont sweat every little problem And dont panic every time you talk to your crush People want to be with someone that helps them relax so if you seem wound up all the time youre going to have a harder time attracting them Change what you want to change for you and no one else If you have things that you dont like about yourself you can change them Theres nothing wrong with that But make sure youre doing it for you and not for anyone else Forcing yourself to be someone youre not isnt going to work out well longterm and you want someone to like you for who you really are  Eat a healthy diet dont starve yourself and get lots of exercise This will help you look healthy and strong a very attractive quality for most people You will also feel a lot better which will show in your everyday interactions          Stay freshsmelling by showering regularly and wearing clean clothes Dont forget deodorant Smelling bad can really turn a lot of people away even if you have a great personality          Wear nice looking clothes and take care of your hair and skin You dont have to dress like a movie star or even wear brand name clothes Just wear what looks good on you and thats really all that people will notice          Confidence is incredibly attractive to both boys and girls Of course you dont have to actually be confident people are rarely as confident as they seem just make people think that you are Do this by not constantly apologizing or being down on yourself and instead stick up for yourself and pursue the things that are important to you          Let your crush see the best side of you Be friendly and kind to them never complain about your hardships or be really negative around them Dont gossip or get really angry around them Let them see you doing things that make you happy and having fun with your friends          People want to date someone who can basically be one of their best friends You want to get along really well Show them that you can fill this role by being a good friend to them Support them when theyre having problems and help them to be their best self by encouraging them to reach for the stars          You cant get their attention and help them get to know you if you never spend time together Hang out either alone or in groups of friends groups is better in the beginning so that they can see how fun you are to be around You can go to movies play games at the arcade or go to special events like local concerts          Talk to them and get to know them for who they really are They wont take your attraction seriously if they feel like you dont know them or like them for who they are Talk about things that matter like what they want out of life or their ideas about current events This is a great way to get to know someone and much more significant than knowing their favorite color          Let them get to really know you All of the things that you want to find out about them let them find out about you Be open to questions and dont try to make yourself seem super mysterious You want them to see you as a whole real person          Find the things that you have in common These are things that you can bond over and share This will help you connect with them on a deeper level and begin to build lasting feelings on both sides Start with things like movies and music and move on to things like hobbies          Even if you dont like the things that are most important to them try to understand those things and see the significance Understanding the thing that matters most to your crush and maybe even learning to enjoy it with them is an important part of developing a relationship          Now one reason that a lot of people are reluctant to get into a relationship is because they think it will mean that theyre going to lose a lot of their freedom Show your crush that with you they have nothing to fear by not only letting them be their own independent person but also showing them that you can be independent too   Dont make your crush think that youre into someone else Make sure to project that you are single and you are looking to date Dont flirt with other people too much and dont spend a ton of your time with someone of their same gender   Start showing your interest in your crush by flirting with them They may not be asking you out or showing an interest because they dont realize that you like them so start dropping hints Just dont start flirting too early on You need to establish a basic friendship first if you want to help guarantee success   Not there Jeez A gentle touch to the shoulder or forearm or even their hand or face if youre feeling bold can show them your interest or even really get them to feel that spark These are very intimate affectionate gestures and their intent is difficult to mistake Do it casually in conversation and definitely not randomly Youll need an excuse or its going to seem forced   If they arent getting the hint you may need to just come right out and admit that you like them Its terrifying we know Our sympathies But you can do it Be bold and brave Taking the initiative may even make them like you more   If respond that they like you to or even if you want to skip that last step and go straight for this one you might just have to ask them out yourself This responsibility is usually going to fall on the guys but theres nothing wrong with girls taking the lead Find some time alone and find out once and for all if you have a chance   Dont sweat rejection If they just dont feel the same way they they arent the right person for you Youll find your special someone It just takes time
This will just leave a bitter taste in your mouth and is not a great way to end something that was good while it lasted  Both of you liked each other a lot or you wouldnt have become involved right So be thoughtful and make the break somewhere secluded and pleasant Try to pick somewhere you can share a local dish favorite drink or other pleasant memory And dont forget to pay for it   Tell him that the fling was fun but that living in completely different places doesnt bode well for your future relationship and that you are dreadful at keeping in touch Tell him that you really enjoyed the time together but that it was only a holiday thing and that it would be unkind to pretend it can continue back in everyday life   Hear him out It may well be that he feels the exact same way as you If not let him express his sorrow and be kind to him It doesnt hurt to ask him to Try to be realistic about the whole situation and to let him know how great he was and that youre sure jealous of his next girlfriend   Theres no harm swapping addresses if you want to Maybe someday youll cross paths again And as time passes it can be good to have a friend in another part of your country or even the world to drop in on and borrow a couch for a night or two
Sometimes we think friendships arent as important as other relationships such as romantic ones or familial ones You may feel like you dont have the right to grieve when a friend drops out of your life Nonetheless your friends are vital to your wellbeing and you are friends with the people in your life for a reason When you lose one of those friends youre going to need to grieve that persons lose in your life just as if youd broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriendIf you try to avoid the pain youll just hold on to it for much longer By acknowledging that you are sad you can grieve and start the process of moving on  Your other friends and your family are there to help you out When youre going to through a hard time its good to lean on your friends and family They can lend an ear to hear you out or just be a safe place where you can cry Dont be afraid to ask people for helpIt can be helpful to talk to a therapist about the breakup especially if the person has been your friend for a long time Its a natural tendency to want to be strong and to not cry too much However crying is a natural release of emotion and its important to let yourself feel that emotion Yes you eventually need to move on Right now though youre hurting and crying is a part of releasing that hurt You may find yourself thinking some irrational thoughts right now For instance you might be saying to yourself I dont think I can live without this person in my life or I must have something wrong with me if my friend doesnt want to be friends with me anymore The key is to change these statements in your head Tell yourself I can create a new life without this person I dont need her to go on living I do need food water and air but I dont need one person or I dont have anything wrong with me Were just in different places Take a moment to think about the good the person brought into your life Consider the ways she made your life better and think about the good memories you had together Despite whats happening now recognizing that the person brought good into your life can help you to move on You dont actually need to see the person again for this step but you do need to find some way to say goodbye to the person to help yourself move on It will help give you the closure you needOne way you can do this step is to write a letter to the person You dont have to send it just write it telling the person all the things you left unsaid and saying goodbyeYou can also have a conversation as if the person was there Say all the things aloud that you wanted to say to the person while you were still friends   You dont have to be an artist to use art to help you heal Doing something creative helps channel your grief into something physical Try painting or drawing what youre feeling or even going to an art therapy class It doesnt have to be good art It simply has to be a representation of what youre feelingDont think too much about what youre going to paint or draw Just start doing it letting your emotions take you where they will   Make sure you are getting your fruits and veggies Also make sure you are eating on a regular schedule Dont forget to include some healthy proteins lowfat dairy and whole grains Not eating healthy will just make you feel worse Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night You should be getting at least 7 to 8 hours at night and even more if youre younger If youre not getting enough sleep youre going to feel even more upset and anxious It also releases endorphins which naturally makes you feel betterTry for 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week One way to get your exercise in is to take a walk at lunch The sunlight will also help boost your mood   Alcohol may numb the pain for a moment but it could lead to a longer addiction Plus it doesnt allow you to face the pain like you need to do If you love painting spend time painting If you enjoy going to the movies do that Go out with your other friends and enjoy the people who are still in your life That is if you have mutual friends dont make them pick a side In fact try not to say anything negative about the friend you broke up with around mutual friends It will only drive a wedge between you and your other friends Now that youve had this experience you can be clearer about what you want in a friend If you broke up with your friend because the relationship was bad for your mental wellbeing consider the qualities that made it bad and what would be better in new friendsFor instance maybe your friend wasnt trustworthy or didnt respect your boundaries When youre making new friends you need to make sure youre not choosing people who are going to cause the same problems   If youre going to make new friends you need to put yourself out there Talk to people in the coffee shop Join local clubs that feature your hobbies Take a class at your local community college Try to meet new people everywhere you goYou cant just go to these events You have actually talk to people and try to get to know them
When you see him walk right up and start a conversationSpark his interest by showing him yours Demonstrate how confident you are by seeking him out right away rather than forever waiting for that perfect moment that may or may not comeDonât worry about declaring your undying love right away Simply get the ball rolling by showing him that you would like to get to know him better   Donât feel superconfident just yet That is all the more reason to go straight up to him Dawdling will just give you more time to overthink things and stress yourself outAlso you dont want to give someone else a chance to get in there first and hog his attention   Donât stress yourself about flooring him with the most clever thing that you could possibly say Instead start small and build from there Draw him into a conversation with you by posing an offhand question or asking for a quick favorWhichever you choose be sure the topic is something that will lead to an actual backandforth conversation instead of a oneword answer Open with something like   âIs that the new iPhone Could I take a peek at it I need to replace my phone and Iâm not sure what I want to getâ âYou have Ms Novak for first period right What was her test like I have to take it eighth periodâ âI like your Smiths tshirt Real quick whatâs your favorite album and whyâ   When you approach make direct eye contact and maintain it Even though youâre nervous stop yourself from glancing away to stare at your feet or something in the distance Gain his attention and keep it by keeping yours on him from start to finishSmile too Put him at ease with a grin as you approach Remember you want him to like talking with you so show him that this conversation is going to be a good thing by opening with a big friendly smile   Once you draw him into a conversation keep him engaged by sticking to a subject he knows about himself As you move from topic to topic show him that your main interest isnât the topic itself but what he thinks about it Flatter his ego so he feels eager to share At the same time avoid the stress of being in the spotlight by keeping it trained on himThink of yourself as an interviewer Ask lots of questions For example if he happens to have a book with him Ask him what he thinks of it so far Then ask what other authors he enjoys Quiz him with âWhich five books would you bring if you were stranded on a desert islandâ Then ask if he could only recommend one to read which one would it be   Donât overdo the questioning and make him feel like this is an interrogation Start peppering the conversation with your own opinions and anecdotes Even though you feel nervous at first share a small piece of yourself when he shares something with you As you grow more comfortable expand and offer him a wider view so the conversation grows to be equal parts give and takeFor instance if one of the books he picks to bring with him to a desert island is the same as one of your picks say so Then use that topic to direct more questions at him âWhich character do you most identify with What was your favorite part What did you think of the movieâ When he shares his answer with you return the favor by answering your own question By asking lots of questions and sharing your own answers you can control the course of the conversation and share exactly what you want to share   As the conversation builds stick to topics that the both of you enjoy Even though you may want this guy to be your shoulder to cry on when you need one save that for later For now show him that you are fun to be around by keeping the conversation carefreeIf he brings up a topic that stresses you out redirect the focus to something more positive Letâs say he brings up a flood that recently hit the city where your favorite aunt lives Instead of focusing on the flood use that as a segue to talk to about a happy memory of your aunt or that city From there shift the focus back onto him by asking about his favorite family member or city
Whether it be on a saddle stand or a nearby fence have it ready to be put straight on the horse so you do not have to make the horse wait any longer than necessary Make sure the top of the saddle pad is covering the horses withers A rule of thumb is to put the saddle pad a little more forward than it really should be so that when you put the saddle on top of the pad the pad can slide back a little You dont want more saddle pad on one side than the other Same goes for the girth if that is on the opposite side of where you are standing Western saddles are generally heavier than English saddles so you may need to swing the saddle to get enough momentum and get the saddle on the horses back Set the saddle on the horses back gently The front of the saddle should be about 2 12 inches away from the front of the saddle pad Make sure that the saddle in even on both sides of the horse and not lopsided Do not tighten the girth too quickly because this tends to lead to a horse learning how to bloat himself to make the girth loose when being saddled

Its more than likely you will never meet your celebrity crush and even if you do its also likely he or she wont take an interest in as you are just another fan to them But why would you set yourself on someone who doesnt value fans as real human beings Dont you want to be with someone who wants to get to know you intimately  Are you applying characteristics to your crush without knowing whether or not they actually have them Though a persons career may be interesting that doesnt necessarily make the person interesting Its likely that besides their work your crush is just like anyone else walking down the street They may be polite and funny but they may also be boring a snob or slob greedy or have many other faults that they just dont show in public   Take down all posters dont see a movie they are in or listen to a song they sing and dont daydream or talk about them with others Immerse yourself in something else that is pleasurable but healthy Until you either get over your crush or appreciate their work but not be obsessed with them take them out of your life   You may think that you could never get sick of your crush but youre more than likely wrong Once you see the same movie listen to the same song or watch the same interview so many times youll just be tired of it Soon youll realize how silly it was to have obsessed over a trivial person This doesnt mean you cant appreciate their work or talent but you certainly dont have to make them the center of your attention at all times   See how much more you admire someone who you already know or are getting to know closely then a celebrity who is constantly traveling working and doesnt have much time to chitchat If someone who is in your immediate life wants to spend time with you take the opportunity to distance yourself from your celebrity crush   Of course you can comment on how handsome or beautiful a celebrity is but once you start disliking or even hating their girlboyfriend or spouse or want to have a relationship with them while theyre taken dont take it too far Its obviously inappropriate  how do you know that it would benefit you or your celebrity crush more if you were in a relationship with them If your celebrity is taken know that they probably found someone right for them and be happy that your celebrity crush is happy in their relationship   Hope that they may find some peace and happiness but dont jump in thinking that its now your turn to snatch them
If you want to know whether your friend likes you or notâassuming you like your friend tooâthen you should give that person a chance to tell you how they feel This is easier than asking them yourself or even sharing your own feelings if you do have them Hereâs how to give your friend the opportunity to tell you   Isolate the person Arrange a solo hangout session and see if anything happens If youâre good friends this wonât seem like a big deal If you like the person try to set up a pseudodate Invite the person to a slightly nicer dinner or a semiromantic movie and see if they tell you anything afterwards Have a drink or two A drink will loosen the personâs inhibition and will make them more likely to reveal their feelings   If you have mutual friends who have seen you together then you can ask them if they think the person likes you Ask the mutual friends of your gender so theyâre less likely to go blabbing to your friend See if they have any insight into your friendâs actions or if theyâve heard anything   Ask them to be honest If you really want to know the truth they should tell you what they honestly think If they donât think your friend likes you in that way they should say so If youâre shy about asking them directly then you can mention your friend and just make an offhand comment about how theyve been acting different lately and see if your friends mention it on their own   This is a more gutsy move Asking your friendâs friends is almost the same thing as asking him if they like you themselves If theyre crushing on you their friends will know but itâs not likely that said friends would tell you You can try asking a close friend of theirs that you really really trust but be careful This plan may backfire   If youâre feeling bold and want to know the answer to your question then you should just ask your friend if they have a crush on you If youâve had the sense that they like you and have thought so for a long time then it may be better to have things out in the open Then againâif you donât like your friend romantically you may think about waiting for the whole thing to blow over But if you do really want to know if they have a crush on you donât make it a big deal and just ask   Donât be nervous about asking If youâre good friends then you should be comfortable talking about anything Just tell your friend that youâve noticed that theyve been acting differently First ask if thereâs anything they want to tell you If they donât take the bait then just ask them if they like you Be casual You donât have to set up an elaborate rendezvous to ask Just pick a private place and ask your friend how they feel about you while making eye contact and keeping your voice calm and steady

Making sure you have a great relationship as friends before moving onto anything else should be considered as much more than simply preparing for your big seduction If you are friends with someone already he is going to base your seduction on what he knows of you as a person moreso than the seduction itself There are friendships in all varying degrees but many things should be true for all of them   Try to make a regular habit of talking to him Even if its small talk it goes to show that youre interested in him as a person and care about the little things Make him feel good about himself People choose the people in their life usually depending on how they make each other feel This is true for relationships as much as friendships  You only want to make your move if you think the timing is right If your friend just heard some bad news and is looking for a shoulder to cry on a seduction might not be a good idea The same is true if there is a lack of chemistry between the two of you at the given time If you think things arent working at the moment its better to wait it out   Try not to wait too long however In doing so you might let someone else take your friend into a relationship thus ruining your chances at seduction   As a general rule the more two people of the opposite sex spend together the more chance there is for something to spark Before you go in for a direct seduction sometimes simply asking to hang out often says a lot on its own If you dont spend time together on a regular basis you should ask him to meet up Even if you are just meeting as friends its a great way to maximize the chances of something happening   Time in a group is okay but there is little chance of something special coming out of that One on one time is different however as it means the two people are there specifically for time with each other   A proper seduction cannot take place if youre in a crowded area To be intimate you need an intimate space This could be at the end of a night at a party together or after one of you has invited the other over A quiet private setting is important because you dont want any external pressures affecting the way the seduction is received Even if someone wants to be seduced he may feel shy about it if he thinks his friends will be there to see it happen   Even if your friend finds you physically attractive you will have a hard time of properly seducing him if youre bringing his mood down Emphasize your positive side This can be done as simply as making a conscious decision to be pleasant around the person you would like to seduce Being cheerful leads to opportunities to flirt more openly whether you consciously mean to or not A proper seduction is very rarely a serious thing Its the way thats going to break the two of you past the barrier between friends and something more Light touching can include anything from a hug to a brief touch on the arm These movements arent risking a lot and you can usually tell from the way theyre reacting to it whether theyll accept bolder gestures   You can try to keep your flirtations subtle if you want to save the chance of pulling back if you decide your affections arent being reciprocated While its normal to make eye contact with a friend while youre talking prolonged eye contact usually hints at something more Studies have shown that holding someones gaze for an extended amount of time can provoke intense feelingsEven if you normally spend time with this friend make a point of keeping eye contact while you seduce him   The reaction of eye contact can be positive or negative A lot of it depends on whether the other person finds you physically attractive If the friend you want to seduce is already close and comfortable enough with you regular conversation should come naturally to the two of you With the foundations in place youll want to work playful flirting into your talk Exchanging light teasing remarks into your conversation is a great place to startCompliments are a more direct way of showing interest especially if those compliments are aimed at things youre typically attracted to   An example of a flirtatious remark Your hair looks great today I think it really suits you   A simple but important thing to do before you make the final push is to reflect on the ways in which your friend has reacted towards your flirtations thus far If hes smiled when youve touched him or responded to your teasing with teasing of his own its probable your friend is inviting you to make a move On the contrary if your friend is looking uncomfortable its probably a sign you should back off   Everyones psychology is different If you are already friends with this person you should have at least a basic idea how you think hed react to someone hes attracted to   All seductions involve a moment of truth Most often this means a kiss although it might also mean an overtly sexual or romantic comment If your friend has responded well to noncommittal overtures you can move in Kissing on the lips is often seen as something that is reserved for more than just friends Once you think the time is right move in Dont be too quick about it either It may be stressful but its not an experience you want to rush   All bold moves are risky by their very nature Its a good idea to feel out your chances before making a commitment to the seduction   Women generally tend to play a more submissive role in seductions but women sometimes play it off as an active way to pull a man in If you think there is mutual attraction there he may well be waiting for the right moment to make his own move You should let him know that its a good idea to step in   Consequences for a seduction could be very good or very bad Your friendship could give birth to a onenight stand or even a longterm relationship On the other hand things can get uncomfortable and awkward quickly If this is the case the best way to repair a friendship provided you want to repair it is by talking openly about what happenedExplain what you felt and why you wanted to do what you did   Its usually best not to pry into questions like why he rejected you Focusing on the rejection itself can lead to bitterness on both ends If all is indeed lost you have to accept your losses Not everything is going to work out the way you want it to the same is especially true in pursuing relationships If the seduction has failed for whatever reason theres going to be a spot of awkwardness It is best to turn this into an opportunity for both sides to vent their feelings and say how they feel This may lessen the impact of the rejection but its necessary if you want to keep the friendship alive Be honest with how you feel If the other person tries to brush it off as a joke it may be best to follow through with that and move past the episode as quickly as possible Otherwise its a good idea to talk about what happened as friends Make sure to let your friend that you care about her as a friend in spite of any added attraction youve had for her   You might start a conversation with something like this I know how this might look While I am attracted to you I also value you as a great friend I hope you dont think I feel any less of you because of this   Following the seduction you need to move forward This is true whether the seduction worked youre staying friends or the friendship was ruined as a result The outcomes vary wildly but even in the worst case there is no benefit in letting yourself suffer over it An important part of life lies in accepting your decisions and learning from them Even if you regret making the seduction you should forgive yourself as soon as you can After all you were taking a risk and for that you should feel proud of yourself   If the seduction fails completely and your friendship is terminated fill the emotional void with something new and freshKeep yourself occupied The people who heal from emotional pain the fastest are those who stay busy Dont take it personally Move on and fuel your frustrations towards getting to a better place in life If the seduction fails but you manage to remain friends try to let things resume as they did Staying friends is easiest if you manage to talk things through when the seduction happens Accept that some feelings arent mutual while others areIf youre rejected at first and the friendship stays together he might begin to see just how much you value him If you let the subject be for the time being there is the chance he might change his mind and realize what a catch you are   If you are already friends with someone there is some chance you can figure out your chances of success based on your existing interactions Is there already some flirting involved in your interactions together Is she involved with someone else already Do you get the impression she already finds you attractive If you get a lessthandesired answer for at least one of these questions it does not necessarily mean there is no hope for you Rather youll have to play your cards right and possibly change things about yourself to suit her needs in a partner   Having expectations beforehand is an important part of making things work Even if you do successfully seduce your friend things can go sour quickly if you dont know where to go from there   Whether they respond well to your seduction is another thing but you should keep in mind that you friend may already have feelings for you that you havent noticed yourself If you go about it in a way that isnt weird or demanding the gesture can seem affectionate if anything   Unlike trying to date a stranger there is more of a risk factor in meaning to seduce a friend For starters you could ruin your friendship Even worse the fallout from it could affect other mutual friendships as well On the other hand a friendship that is strong enough can usually survive a failed seduction provided things are discussed openlyCrossreference your expectations with your expected chances and decide for yourself whether you should go through with it There is no easy answer to a question like this but it is important that you live with whatever decision you make Although going for the seduction may seem like the riskier move staying quiet can result in just as much pain if you really like the person   It should also be said that there are varying degrees of success that relate to your expectations If you want a relationship but think youll only get a one night stand at best it is up for debate whether it is worth it Likewise it is also dubious to attempt a onenight stand with someone you think may get emotionally tied to you after the fact   There are a lot of degrees by which you could seduce a friend You may want to get a full relationship with her and its possible you may otherwise prefer a friends with benefitstype situation If a friends with benefits arrangement is what youre specifically looking for its recommended you try looking for one of your friends that is already open and comfortable with sexuality
After the breakup it is necessary to minimize contact for awhile This does not mean that you should completely ignore the person as it will lead to hurt feelings Instead try to create some space and time so you both can heal But if something not break up related comes up feel free to share it with them This way you are maintaining a dynamic without the intensity  If that is not possible try to attach a positive emotion to it but instead of a romantic one try to think of it as something a friend or family member would have given you This will also help with shifting your feelings for the personTake some time for yourself to go through both the good and the bad moments together Really decide if this person is someone who you want to be friends with If you truly feel that you do want to be ONLY friends then you should reestablish contact again During this time work on yourself too and do things that make you happy   It is important to find a time frame that works for both of you When that time is up make contact with the other person decide who will contact whom and carefully ask them how they are doing If either of you needs more time then give it   Dont let them find out from someone else because that will definitely be the end of the friendship But you must also realize that just because you were friends before you can not discuss the details of your new relationship with them as it would hurt too much You may find you will never be able to do this again without jealousy coming from one of you   It takes time to heal so keep that in mind All you can do is be patient But you may find that you have both grown apart or dont have anything left to give If that the case then that is okay Just remember the good times what youve learned and move on Sometimes the best thing really is to let go and let other opportunities come your way
So your teenâs date demonstrates questionable behavior or has a disappointing reputation Keep in mind that you donât have to trust the date when you trust your child If you have instilled good values into your child and they know their selfworth you can depend on them to choose a partner who has similar valuesBeing able to trust your child comes down to knowing who you raised Have you had any reason to question your teenâs judgment before If not give them the benefit of the doubt Odds are if you have warned your child about a dubious character others may have too In fact they may get the sense deep down that their date is bad news but they may need time to come to terms with it   Your child is bound to encounter undesirable friends and partners Giving them the room to experience the relationship can help them learn how to successfully navigate these types of situationsBe sure that your child knows what they should expect from a healthy relationship Discuss this with them often so that they understand what they deserve If your instinct tells you to be on alert for your childâs new date try your best to monitor the relationship You may not be able to altogether keep them from spending time together but you can enforce rules that restrict their visitsSet ageappropriate guidelines and sit down to discuss them with your teen You might limit phone calls social media use dates or house visits Setting these limits gives you an opportunity to closely observe the relationship to determine whether it is harmless or toxic   If you have evidence that your teen is being mistreated or abused put your foot down Obsessive communication with the date unexplained marks or bruises and marked changes in your childâs attitude or behavior may clue you in to an unhealthy or abusive relationshipBeware that forcing your child to end the relationship will probably affect your relationship with your child for a while However you must do this in order to keep your child out of danger Say something like âIâve seen the marks on your arms I know heâs hitting you I forbid you from seeing or talking to him again I will also be talking to his parentsâ

Often one of the things a Christian girl will find most attractive in a guy is a heart for God A great way to display this love is to become a devout believer Youll probably want to attend mass regularly especially the masses she attends and to take an active interest in scripture However youll want to avoid extreme forms of dogmatism  dont use your religion to criticize her or impose limits on her Everyone hates condemnation  any conviction should come from HER conscience and if she asks you for advice listen and share   Shes a Christian girl so chances are shell want a boy who will treat her like a real woman Conduct yourself like a Christian should by treating her with respect Be a gentleman to her in whatever way you know how To some this will mean opening doors carrying her books and offering her your seat while to others such traditional displays of respect will seem outdated Never be casually lewd around her Talking dirty may impress your friends but most Christian girls will be offput by this sort of talk Some will show a wild side when theyre more comfortable around you while others never will   If you are both very religious you may want to pray for the object of your affections and cautiously ask her to do the same for you You may ask for general wellwishing prayers or for guidance from God for something specific you are struggling with in your walk with God This has the potential for awkwardness so try to avoid sharing intensely personal details until you are very close with this person Instead you may want to speak in generalities  sometimes just asking for a prayer with no other explanation is enough   Your Christian girlfriend should be a very important part of your life but not your reason for living If your love for Jesus isnât motivation enough to grow in maturity and pursue godliness then you are not ready for a Christian woman Your first goal as a Christian man should be to grow in your relationship with God and to keep him at the center of your life Do this before you think of starting a close relationship with any Christian woman Only when Jesus is placed in the middle of the relationship and more importantly your own life you can truly experience love as it is meant to be   Most Christian girls are very classy and they want classy men Open the doors for her pull out her chair and always pay for the date Remember to be polite and respectful around her family Most Christian moms and especially fathers look for this in guys They want a guy to treat her daughters right and be polite By doing that parents will probably approve of your relationship with her much more quickly and it might give you a better chance to be alone with her quickly
Keep him guessing by only providing a few details about yourself at a time instead of telling him your life story When he asks questions only provide half answers so that he has to keep the conversation going to find out what he wants to know By providing a little mystery you make yourself appealing to just about anyoneFor example hint at your favorite hobby by saying âThe last time I ate tacos was at the cast party for Romeo and Julietâ When your crush asks if you were in the play you could half answer and say âBeing part of the show was amazing I hope I get to do My Fair Lady somedayâ This will keep them wondering if you were the star of the show and will make you seem more exciting   Donât show how eager you are to spend time with him even if youâre not busy Make a show of running through your list of plans before committing to spending time with him especially if heâs inviting you to a group eventTry mixing up the days on purpose For example if your crush mentions a party that your group will go to on Friday night say âOh Saturday I already have tickets to a concertâ Then when they correct you say âThatâs awesome I can probably make Friday happen Thanks for reminding meâ Suggest alternate plans For example if your crush asks you to get frozen yogurt on Tuesday ask them if you can do it on Thursday instead because of a conflict This will keep them guessing about what youâre doing   One of the hallmarks of the mysterious cool girl is the fact that she sees herself somewhere special in the future whether itâs art school or running for president Figure out what yours could be Would you love to have your own makeup company or to move to the big city to work as a pastry chef Think about how you can make your daydreams come trueDonât explain your big plans to your crush Instead casually refer to it while youâre within earshot of your crush You could say âIâm so tired of taking classes that I donât need Thatâs why Iâm going to art school in a few yearsâ or âYou better enjoy my macarons for free while you can because pretty soon theyâll be lining up in the streets of New Orleans for a taste of themâ   Mixed signals are a classic tool for making someone jealous because they keep the person guessing While itâs a little mean sending mixed signals will allow you to get someoneâs attention while still avoiding embarrassment because whether or not youâre into them will be unclearTurn the conversation to serious topics after a flirty exchange After you talk to them for a bit at a social event focus all of your attention on someone else for awhile After texting them a lot take a break Wait a day or two before answering their last text This can backfire It can make you look mean or thoughtless or just like you dont like them Use this tactic with caution   When both of you are going to be at the same event donât rush to talk to your crush Instead say âhiâ to other people first and try to strike up a conversation with someone Think about which social justice or societal issue is the most important to you and write down a few comments about these issues that you could share with your trust Show them that you are a thoughtful intelligent personYou could also look at blogs and memes that deal with philosophical issues to help you figure out your own deep thoughts

Remember shy people are just like everyone else except with a wall like I said they wont run away if you make quick movements Small conversation is usually rather impersonal and can consist of the homework weather teachers something on the news or otherwise If he really likes you he wont be able to stop thinking about you   If you dont go to school with him maybe ask what he likes to do other then homework and school or even maybe ask for his number Remember if he doesnt text you first dont sweat it If hes shy in person with you hell be shy everywhere with you  It wont intimidate him as much and will give him a chance to think about his answer If you dont have social media just try asking for a simple number   By talking to him a few times a week you will begin establishing a bond and he may start to tear down his wall for you After small talk you should begin moving onto personal things like family travel summer vacation plans his hobbies and other casual but personal topics   After youve talked to him for awhile transition conversations onto a more personal level Perhaps talk about what you both are looking for in a person and drop hints that what youre looking for is him   Dont ask him if hes okay with being touched just do it once and see how he reacts A touch or pat on the shoulder is fine If he seems to dislike it then refrain from touching him until you know he is more comfortable with you However if he seems fine with it then you should continue to do it every once in a while Dont go too far hugs when needed small touches on his arm and pats on the shoulder are just fine   Make sure to do this in private and oneonone Dont even ask around close friends or else he might feel uncomfortable as well as feel pressured to say yes You want him to say yes because he wants to not because he thinks he needs to He might also be pressured to say no so be careful   Going out to public places is most likely not his thing Suggest a movie at your house though he might be afraid to meet your parents or something else thats away from people You could also suggest getting drivethrough dinner and parking some place quiet to eat and talk   If necessary find a way to increase his selfesteem Make him feel confident around you   It could be a homework problem or where to buy the latest gadget Whatever works   Because shy guys are guys too Find out his hobbies or passions Or talk about a common interest DO NOT PRETEND TO LIKE SOMETHING YOU DONT But ask openended questions about it It will make you a good listener get to know him better and you will have fewer chances to say something stupid If you do anyway as 99 of us do forgive yourself   Most guys actually approach cute girls over gorgeous girls because they find really pretty girls out of their league This applies particularly to shy guys who have little confidence to begin with Im not saying it isnt okay to be really really really incredibly goodlooking But dont draw so much attention to it Now is not the time to try cuttingedge fashion or overthetop makeup   Make it fun by trying some icebreaking games and whatnot
Regular exercise can help lift your mood and can help you keep busy This will give you less time to ruminate over what happened with your exboyfriend Try picking up a new exercise routine to help boost your mood and forget your exChoose a type of routine you like as youll be more likely to stick to it If you hate running dont commit to a weekly run Instead go for a bike ride after work Start any new workout routine slowly You may want to talk to your doctor first especially if its been awhile since you worked out regularly  Do you have any old hobbies you no longer do Now may be a good time to pick up that hobby If you can stay busy with a particular hobby or interest you are more likely to forget about your boyfriendThink about something you used to do that got away from you Maybe you used to be an avid knitter but got busy with other things Try taking up a knitting project again after breaking up with your ex If you cant think of any old hobbies try a new one Find something you enjoy that youve never tried before For example maybe you could join a sports league A new hobby can easily help you get your mind off your ex   Stock up on comedies and feel good movies Its a good idea to allow yourself to embrace something silly and lighthearted in the wake of a great betrayal Make a Netflix collection of comedies Marathon watch your favorite humor television show This will keep your mind off the pain and help you forget Theres no sense closing yourself off from others in the wake of a breakup As you attempt to forget your exboyfriend surround yourself with supportive friends A solid support system can help you forget how your ex hurt you You will also feel grateful for all the good people in your life even if your romantic relationship ended poorlyIn a relationship you get used to having someone around all the time With a significant other you feel like someone is always a text or a phone call away When things end you may find yourself wishing for that closeness again Remember you do have people in your life You have friends and family members who care about you Reach out to them on your bad days Do something fun that will take your mind off your ex   It seems counterintuitive but this will actually help you forget your ex Studies show if you try to not think about something youll just end up thinking about it more Instead of trying to obliterate your ex from your consciousness allow yourself to occasionally engage in thoughts of your exDo not panic if you occasionally think about your ex Instead of thinking I need to not think about this Why am I letting this get to me stop and accept the thoughts Think something like Its normal to still feel sad sometimes Im going to let myself experience these thoughts Instead allow yourself to experience the thoughts for a few minutes Remind yourself why youre upset but ultimately better off Remember this person cheated on you and broke your trust Youre better off without him   Dealing with a cheating boyfriend may cause you to start to evaluate your own actions and wonder if you could have somehow prevented the situation If you find yourself doing this take a moment to remind yourself that your boyfriend chose to cheat and that you had nothing to do with that decision   Try saying something to yourself like âThis was his decision I could not have stopped it and I did not cause itâ   This can actually help you feel better about the breakup allowing you to move on and forget faster When you start feeling sad about the breakup remind yourself of your exs bad qualities This can stop you from romanticizing the relationship You can acknowledge your exs imperfections in a healthy cathartic mannerObviously the infidelity is a major flaw However that is not something you have to focus your energies towards if it makes you sad You can think about small things For example I hate that he always made us late to movies or I hate that he clipped his toenails in the living room Allow yourself to be a little petty   If youre still in contact with him youre not going to be able to forget him If you dont want to continue the relationship then cut off contact Stop texting him calling him or interacting with him on social mediaAvoid the temptation to call him in moments of weakness If youre upset and need to vent turn to friends over your exboyfriend You should only reestablish contact when youre ready to have a relationship again Keep in mind however you may never feel ready for a relationship again Many people struggle to stay friends with their exes Its okay if you do not want this person as a friend   You do not want to emotionally unload on everyone in your friends group Having everyone know your business may make it hard to forget You also open yourself up to potentially unsolicited advice Pick one or two close friends and tell them about the infidelityTry to limit your venting however You do not want to end up upsetting yourself by making your ex the subject of too many conversations Talk a little about your ex to these friends Then discuss other topics that help you forget and move on   If your exboyfriend cheated you may want to know everything possible about the man or woman he cheated with However seeking out details is only likely to make you feel bad Nothing good will come of looking through old credit card receipts and emails or looking at your exs social media profile You do not need to know the details now that the relationship is overIf necessary have an action plan in place when you feel the need to dig up details You can think of something specific to do instead For example instead of going through your exs Facebook posts have a video game to play instead   Dealing with a cheating boyfriend can make you feel sad angry and confused You can use selfsoothing activities to help you to feel better as you experience your emotions Some things you might try include   Taking a long bath Listening to some of your favorite music Writing in a journal or drawing Reading a book or watching a movie Spending time with your pet or with family members   Selfcare should not be neglected in the wake of a breakup Make sure to take care of yourself while healing If you neglect things like healthy eating and sleeping you end up feeling worse This will make it harder to turn your energy away from your exAnxietyinducing thoughts get worse if youre hungry tired dehydrated or deprived in other ways Stick to your regular routine to keep your mood as good as possible You should also find healthy ways to deal with stress Avoid things like heavy drinking Instead get a small treat to eat Go to a spa for a day Treat yourself to a new outfit   If an ex cheated you may sometimes feel yourself trapped in bitter thoughts If you feel like youre drowning in feelings of anger and resentment stop and say I want to be happy This will help shift your focus to all the positive things you have instead of focusing on how one person hurt youRemind yourself you actually want to be happy in moments when you feel yourself getting sad This will help you tune out the small frustrations in favor of embracing the future For example you see a romantic Facebook post from your exs new romantic interest Instead of getting angry say I want to be happy You will remember your goal is happiness and youll find other things to focus on   Infidelity can make you feel invaluable Remember you decide how much value you have and not another person When times get difficult and you feel bad about yourself think about your good qualitiesWrite a list of all your good qualities Jot down everything in your life that makes you feel valuable and happy Then write down things you have to be grateful for Think about things like your friends and family members   Theres no sense harboring negativity when considering the future Say to yourself each day I deserve better Embrace the fact youre a good person who deserves a faithful partnerTell yourself youre going to meet someone better Everyone goes through breakups and everyone sometimes feels they will not recover However youre bound to eventually find someone who is kinder to you than your ex was Each time you start feeling bad about your ex say something to yourself like Its okay I can and will do better   If you were cheated on it can seriously affect your sense of selfworth Take steps to rebuild your selfconfidence in the wake of infidelity Prioritize positive selftalk and finding ways to feel good about yourselfMake a list of things you like about yourself This can help you remind yourself you have value Think about your current relationships Remind yourself youre lucky to have close friends and family members who value you even if someone else hurt you Remember everything you do right Congratulate yourself for your recent successes and take stock of your talents and abilities
Right after a break up itâs very common for women to blame themselves However instead of piling guilt on top of all the negativity you are already experiencing try your best to be positive and kind to yourself Remember that you want to reinvent yourself for yourself not to get your partner back or to prove something to the rest of the world   Cut out the negative selftalk Instead of dwelling on your failures and what you could have done differently comfort yourself as you would comfort your best friend Tell yourself you did what you could reflect on what youâve learned from the experience and give yourself positive affirmations If you are finding it difficult to get through your days try saying some daily affirmations in the mirror Look in the mirror and repeat a phrase several times to your reflection such as âI am worthy beautiful and strongâ It may sound silly but telling yourself positive affirmations and doing your best to truly believe in them can help reset your thinking and encourage a more positive outlook on the world  The extreme stress caused by a break up causes different reactions but regardless taking care of your physical health is of utmost importance especially when the break up happened recently You may have difficulty sleeping turn to food for comfort or have no desire to eat at all Regardless of how your body reacts do your best to maintain as many healthy routines as possible   You may crave chocolates or other unhealthy foods but try to maintain a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables Not only will this help you feel better but your body will also thank you and you will avoid the dreaded postbreak up pounds Eating healthy doesnât mean depriving yourself of all treats If all you want to do is eat your feelings in the form of a gallon of ice cream try spooning out a reasonable portion of ice cream into a separate bowl and enjoying it slowly Satisfying your craving can actually boost your psychological state but if you overdo it by binge eating youâll end up feeling worse about yourself in the long run   Any form of exercise whether it be yoga or even just running around the block for fifteen minutes can also offset some of the anxiety and sadness you experience through an uptick of dopamine and other feelgood chemicals in the brain A break up can be a great reason to treat yourself to a onemonth trial at a new yoga studio or even try out a new activity like pole dancing or Zumba that gets you working out in a supportive and upbeat community   You may not feel like leaving the house or moving at all If thatâs the case try doing some light stretches or just walking around the block until you are feeling better After all every little step counts Losing yourself in a new workout activity or sport can not only be a great way to distract yourself from the negative emotions you are processing but can also contribute to a fitter stronger body which could improve your confidence and contribute to the new reinvented you   In the aftermath of a relationship itâs always good to take some time to reflect on your life After all no matter how in love you were with the person your life is ultimately your own and this can be a great opportunity to reflect on your hopes goals and dreamswhat you ultimately see as your own purpose in life   If you donât have any concrete goals now could be a great time to start They can be as simple as âlearn how to salsa danceâ or âget a promotionâ If you already have some goals such as getting Aâs in school brainstorm what you can do on a regular basis to get to that point Coming up with regular todo lists can contribute to your success and also get you back into rhythm after the postbreak up trauma Many of us lose track of our goals when weâre in a relationship Whether this was the case for you or not try to keep sight of your goals as and think of them as an umbrella to shelter yourself from disappointment Pinning your hopes on yourself and working towards your goals in a concrete manner will help you move on and even potentially put you in contact with people who are better suited to you After all reinventing yourself is all about recentering your focus on your life including how you feel and how you present yourself to the world For some reinventing yourself may be all about getting on track with your life goals while for others physical alterations are more important   If possible have a friend tag along or even do a makeover with you Not only will you have more fun youâll also get some friendly guidance that will help steer you away from any potentially regrettable decisions If you and your ex had a shared social group reach out to a friend that is either outside of that friend group or is much closer to you than your ex such as a childhood friend who became friends with your ex much later You donât want to put anyone in the uncomfortable position of choosing sides   Theres nothing like a good pampering to ease all the troubles away so treat yourself to a massage facial or a manipedicure Or if spa treatments arenât your thing buy yourself a new perfume or even indulge in your favorite candy   If you canât afford expensive spa treatments doing facials or manipedis at home can still give you the same benefits Inviting a friend over can further help lift your spirits as well   Doing so will increase your self confidence and also help you psychologically adjust to your life in the aftermath of a break up   If you canât afford a new hairstyle or clothes donât despair You can always check out thrift stores for cheap interesting pieces or dye your hair yourself rather than going to a salon Even a change as small as parting your hair differently can have a dramatic impact on your look and more importantly how you feel about yourself If you usually wear a signature perfume try changing it up Many of us connect memories with scents and so continuing to wear a certain scent may remind you of your ex and bring you down Buying a new perfume will not only be a great way to treat yourself but could also help you begin a new chapter in life When talking about makeovers people usually focus on the outward changes in appearance but you should apply the concept of the makeover to your personality and emotional state as well Take some time to reflect on what you would like to change about your attitudes or behaviors and what you can do to implement those changes   For example many people suffer from low selfconfidence especially after a break up Try boosting your confidence by focusing on the positives in your outlook and your selfimage and changing your body posture to communicate confidence such as standing straight and keeping your shoulders down Many people give up activities they once loved or stop spending as much time on them when they are in a romantic relationship This is natural but now that you are newly single take the opportunity to take up reading your favorite books jumping back into your favorite sport or spending more time with your girl friends   Go through your belongings and get rid of mementos old clothes anything that you feel doesnât serve a purpose other than to remind you of the pain of the lost relationship   This includes truly letting go of the relationship you were in If you two have agreed to be friends be sure to have a set âtime outâ period so that things can cool off between you two If the break up ended badly do your best to just forget about your ex and move on with your life After a breakup is a great time to start a new hobby or learn a new skill All that time you once spent with your ex can now be channeled into doing the things you want to do Reflect on if thereâs anything youâve ever wanted to do but somehow never found the time or drive to act on that desire   Some women even take this as an opportunity to make an ambitious career or education change If youâve always secretly wanted to finish your degree or apply for a job abroad then take the break up as an opportunity to do it Trying something new doesnât have to be dramatic however For some women taking up painting getting through that stack of classics thatâs been collecting dust or taking an online course can be just as satisfying   After your initial mourning period itâs important to not get stuck in a post break up rut Whether itâs going to the park going dancing or just reconnecting with close friends itâs important to go out and do fun things Remember that at the end of the day you live life as an individual so get out there and live your life   Just be sure to not go out of control Many people resort to harmful or selfdestructive behaviors such as drinking too much or acting out during grieving periods You can avoid this by doing emotional checkins For example if you make plans to meet at a bar with friends but are really only looking forward to the drinks you should examine where that desire is coming from and plan to do something else with your friends or ask them to monitor how much you drink so that you donât lose control Donât go to parties or other events that your ex is also likely to attend You both need a substantial period of time apart in order to heal and move on If youâve already said yes to a party and only find out later that your ex will be there cancel and make new plans for the evening unless you are positive that you are emotionally ready for a possible interaction   This step may be further down the line but make sure to take what you have learned from your last relationship and carry the lessons with you Reflect on what kind of partner the new you would like and what you have to offer them   Remember you and your ex broke up for a reason and part of reinventing yourself is to have a happier more fulfilling life so look for qualities in other people that will make that happen
If you loved your ex a lot and had a happy relationship youre most likely feeling downright depressed If you pretend that youre fine and dont process your feelings though youre only causing yourself longterm emotional damage Take a week or two to mourn over the breakup but make sure your mourning period is not so long that it interferes with your ability to enjoy life in the future  Was the relationship a happy relationship or was it toxic If the relationship was toxic or manipulative breaking up was the right move If you find yourself still wanting your toxic ex back make a list of the negative qualities of your ex and the reasons why your relationship was poisonous Sometimes losing the worst relationships hurts the most   If your relationship was perfectly happy and compatible and the two of you decided to break up because you just felt as if its time to start seeing other people remind yourself that people change and grow especially during the teenage years Typically in middle school relationships are not longparing and breakups often occur at this stage Perhaps your ex broke up because he or she felt drained by the commitment of your relationship and desired for more time with friends and family
Do they seem to get more tense when they realize youre in the same room Do they cross their legs towards you and keep their shoulders pointed at you at the same time Do they try to appear goodlooking Do they every so often take a look in your direction to see if youre looking at them If so it could be a good sign that theyre into you Small things like this often can mean more than what it seems   Another good sign is if you notice them hanging around you even though youre not having a conversation with them Looking straight into your eyes although they may be a little nervous doing so means theyre paying attention to you If you feel like they are looking deep into your eyes that could also be a sign Most of the time if a crush likes you theyll jump at the opportunity to help you Even with small things theyll always be there to help out with your problems especially if you ask Do they sometimes show off and tell jokes around you to make you laugh Do they look straight at you when they deliver the punchline How do you feel around them  Do they ever tell you about something special theyre doing such as reading a book or playing a sport out of the blue Does HeShe tell you secrets and random stories about their day They might be trying to impress you   Do they give you semipersonal information when you didnt ask for it Giving people personal information is a sign that they trust you or want you to give them personal information back Do they talk about their family their ex or about the past These topics are all things people are usually pretty guarded about If your crush is letting you in on them it may be a sign   Whether or not its conscious someone who likes you more often girls will generally find excuses to touch you   They might put their hand on your shoulder or accidentally walk into you in the halls or wipe something random off your face Do they tickle you or tease with their hands Do they ask you for piggybacks or throw random things at you in an effort to get your attention Even gestures that dont seem playful or nice might mean theyre attracted to you Lots of people understand that their body language is giving them away and try to make the body language mean or impersonal Do they hit you lightly or play pranks on you It might mean that they want attention from you and theyre trying to get it without telegraphing their true feelings   Do you ever see them looking at you when they think you cannot see them If you catch himher looking at you and you look back do they look away If they do that could be a sign of nervousness   On the other hand do they always avoid looking at you no matter what Not looking at someone might mean theyre trying to keep their crush secret and dont want you to know Get a trusted friend to look at them during class or at recess have the friend see whether your crush looks at you and for how long If theyre constantly staring in your direction for minutes at a time theyre really crushing hard   Are they more shy or attentive around or when talking to you than with other people   If theyre normally a superconfident person and the sight of you turns them into blabbering mush its a pretty good sign they like you especially if theyre nervously playing with their hands Be careful however because shy people are usually shy all the time You could misread whether your crush actually likes you So its best to use this information along with the other steps when youre making the call about whether or not they like you   Does it seem that they make it a point to happen to be near you or walk back and forth in front of you Then it means that they are trying to get your attention but in a very discreet way   Does their voice get louder when theyre talking to other people around you It could be a sign that they want you to listen or pay attention to them Do they make little excuses to be around you Do they ask you for the homework problems or sit next to you in class or pick you to be on their team for recess sports It could mean something   If they act like a gentleman or gentlewoman to you its often a sign that they like you   Does he or she open the door for you or give you parts of their lunch that they usually never give to other people Does he or she stick up for you when you get in a fight or when someone badmouths something youre doing Do they say to their friends Stop saying bad things about himher Does he or she suddenly get along with a lot of your friends that they used to not care about Do they constantly look at you during class periods you have with them
While youve probably done a good job in asking her about her interests and learned a lot about her dont shy away from sharing information about yourself The more she learns about you the more shes going to find she has in common with you People tend to gravitate toward people they relate to and share interests with   Share your own favorite hobbies music and movies but also share the more indepth subject matter as well If youre passionate about a particular topic talk about it Chances are youre going to be very charismatic and truthful in what you say After all youre passionate about it   A great way to garner and maintain interest is to have more oneonone situations Develop as many chances as possible to get the girl alone to learn all you can about one another Human beings are pretty complex creatures a simple interaction and conversation isnt going to be enough Have as many as you possibly can   Where the date is isnt as important as what youre doing during the date Make sure its somewhere you both will be able to enjoy yourself and have plenty of opportunities to interact with one another A concert may sound like a great date idea but the focus will be on the music and band rather than each other   Never try to be anything more than you already are While there may be certain parts of yourself that you dont like that doesnt mean you should pretend to be something completely different Be yourself  you have plenty to offer anyone and everyone who comes in contact with you whether you realize it or not Just because youre interested in this girl doesnt mean you should change
Be absolutely certain that you arent interested in trying to pursue a dating relationship with this person it isnt a good idea to cast this person aside only to realize you did so because of nerves fears or because your friend felt jealous The reason to help a crush realize that youre just not interested must be because you truly arent interested period ever  Any normal person will be worried about inflicting emotional pain on anotherââbe reassured that this confirms youre emotionally attuned However it is important to realize that its far kinder to let someone down early on than to play games lead them on and then toss them away when it all gets too serious just because you were terrified of telling the truth initially   Feeling embarrassed is normal but not a reason to be callous or to withhold your own true feelings Dont ignore the issue Ignored issues turn into big problems that are much harder to deal with   This may feel like a way of diffusing the discomfort of the situation but laughing about it will likely be hurtful for your crush Remember that telling someone how you feel about him or her is a huge step a giant risk and being laughed back at is very alarming Stifle the desire to make a joke or laugh Instead   Try saying something like I really appreciate you telling me that you like me Im really flattered Jane Explain the way in which youre flattered according to the context of the conversation with your admirer   This could also be stated as Dont beat around the bush In other words tell your crush politely and kindly that you dont feel the same way After explaining that youre flattered that he or she feels this way from the previous step its important to go straight to this honesty   Say something simple like As I said Im really flattered John but Im sorryââI just dont feel the same level of connection with you I love our friendship and Im keen to stay good friends Avoid going into heavy details as to why youre not ablereadywanting to get involved such as getting over someone still or focusing on your career right now Sometimes too many details can give hooks for the listener to grasp onto leaving open a possibility that if X happens then I am in with a chance Dont leave yourself open to thisââit is just too risky   Just because someone you once shared good times with had a friendship with or had a good working relationship with has since declared his or her feelings for you doesnt mean the two of you need to maintain distance from now on or pretend that nothing happened Not only did something momentous happen between you for those of you still staying in regular contact through friends work or social relationships it is important to stay honest and open with each other Accept that things will feel a little awkward for a time but as time passes youll both be able to acknowledge this occurrence with friendly hindsight and you may even develop a stronger friendship for it   If you dont want to preserve the relationship with this person its fairly easy to doââavoid him or her dont spend time around him or her in the company of mutual friends and ask to be reassigned so that you dont have to work together But thats an awful lot of trouble to go to rather than simply acknowledging each other and being prepared to talk respectfully to each other   This goes back to the feelings of discomfort you may have felt initially when you were mulling over what to say in return to your unwanted crush The reality is that the feelings of this person belong to him or herââyou didnt make this person feel a certain way and you cannot carry the blame for how he or she continues to feel At some point in your own life you will feel strongly about someone who wont feel the same way back Realize that while you will be hurt by this persons lack of returning the feelings you also realize that youre fully responsible for your own feelings in the matter   See the episode compassionately Provided youve done your best to let down your unwanted crush politely and kindly you can move on with integrity
The simplest way to find out if she likes you is to ask her out on a romantic date Make sure she understands that this date goes beyond just being friends For example a dinner and a movie will seem more serious and romantic than grabbing lunch together   You need to tell her how you feel if you expect her to tell you how she feels If you think she may not understand where you are coming from when you ask her out on a date try telling her how you feel first Explain that you have romantic feelings for her and tell her the reasons why Once youâre finished you should ask her how she feels   If she says no thatâs okay Donât take it personally It may hurt your feelings but at least you went for it That requires a lot more bravery than most people can muster   Letters are pretty neat Everyone likes getting a letter If you donât want to talk to her in person write her a letter telling her your feelings   This is sort of a childish way to figure out if a girl likes you but it may work If her friends know the girl likes you and that she is waiting for you to ask her out on a date they may be inclined to tell you   If the girl wants to keep it a secret she may tell her friends to stay quiet Take what her friends say with a grain of salt
This allows room for both points of view and states your position as an agreement It also puts you on more equal footing in the discussion and encourages a more cooperative approach  A lot of times suggesting a break up is a sign of desperation when needs are not being met What does he need from the relationship that hes not getting And are these things realistic Does he maybe feel pressured by your wishes and are those realistic   Encourage him to talk about what he needs and listen to what hes saying Put aside defensiveness and try to understand where hes coming from Ask for specific examples of situations where he felt his needs were being neglected Examine any recent disagreements you might have had and try to identify the needs that were associated with them  Does he need more affirmation from you for his accomplishments and sacrifices Does he feel that you are contributing equally to the relationship Is he bored with his current routine Are some of the expectations from the beginning of the relationship not being met Do you have conflicting values about family and relationships     Let him know that you are willing to compromise and refocus the conversation on specific problems rather than having the whole relationship called into question   This also means that the next time he mentions break up you try to confirm what issues hes concerned about Make sure he understands that hes able to address issues without mentioning the breakup as a threat to you Mentioning breaking up without the urge to follow trough can cause lots of anxiety Rather than trying to figure out everything by yourself try to open up a discussion on finding solutions besides a break up Give him some suggestions for changes you can make to help him get what he needs These depend on your particular situation but here are some commonly applicable ones  Suggest rearranging your schedule and habits to make more time for him Suggest fun activities you can share that align with some of his goals Let him off the hook sometimes for some social obligations he doesnt enjoy Be realistic and compromise to make sure he supports you at functions where you really need him bu can bow out of nonessential obligations Set up a compromise for when you disagree about movies music or other cultural activities Try to mention out loud that its not necessary to have a discussion about this Say Its not important to have a discussion about that video We disagree thats all right Agree to give him more time alone to spend with his own interests family and friends if thats his wish     The goal is to find common ground so you can work together to solve conflicts You are each entitled to your opinions but ultimately the relationship depends on finding ways in which you can both be right   Remember that even if what you have to say is valid how you present it counts Anything that sounds oppositional or accusatory might be taken as the start of a fight especially if hes already agitated   Understand that you probably wont fix everything in your relationship over the course of one talk Allow yourselves time to express your thoughts   Exercise common courtesy Dont talk over him and dont interrupt Things might seem really urgent at the moment but its important that he feels that youre listening Take his emotional state into account Give him some time to adjust He might be angry and possibly confused Set the tone for fairness and give him room to cool off   Move past blame in order to find positive solutions Telling him what happened is his own fault can soothe your ego when hes threatening to break up with you but if you want him to stay let him know that you can accept the person that he is   Be careful when bringing up the past Aristotle maintained that the main purpose of the past tense was to identify where blame should be placed Be evenhanded in your recollection of past events And write down relevant past behaviours so that they wont interfere with everydaysituations Dont berate him over things he cant change Putting him in a state of permanent condemnation over things he has no control over makes it seem like hes incapable of pleasing you Dont assault his character Nobody wants to be around people who dislike their inner qualities If you feel you have to criticize emphasize that you are talking about his behavior And youre doing this to help him You would want the same from him Understand the difference between expressing feelings and assigning blame Yes you should respect each others feelings but starting a sentence with the words I feel doesnt mean you can say whatever you want without consequences  When you start a sentence with I feel make sure the rest of the sentence contains a feeling like happy frustrated or confused Be aware that its very common to say I feel to disguise an accusation I feel youre seeing it wrong is not talking about a feeling     Nobody wants to admit they can be manipulative but sometimes in the heat of an argument logic flies out the window and its easy to resort to childish tactics to trick the other person into giving you what you want   Learn to notice manipulation The main way to recognize it is that it unfairly limits the other persons choices Look for a good relationship counseling reference for more examples and discussion of manipulative tactics Here are some common ones  Namecalling Only a stupid person would think that Stonewalling Giving someone the cold shoulder in order to punish them Giving them time or taking time is different If you need some time mention this I need some time leave me alone for a minute I feel frustrated Threats Go ahead and leave but Im keeping the dog appeals to pity How can you leave me after everything Ive been through   Instead give positive reasons to stay Emphasize that you love him not that he cant do any better Manipulative behavior doesnt address the real problems in the relationship and can only breed resentment   As infants we can die if were abandoned and so if we think were being left behind we react with extreme fear and emotional outbursts These emotional reactions can persist into adulthood if they are not adequately addressed and can complicate relationshipsRemember that no matter how painful a break up is you can survive it Even if you dont want to break up remembering this can help you find the strength to make necessary changes and express your feelings without breaking down or acting childish If he needs to think give him the space he needs Tell him that you want him to stay but that you respect his decisions Doing this shows you are not desperate or clingy and that hes allowed to have his own feelings Dont let go of your position of strength This doesnt mean that you shouldnt admit that you might be wrong or that you cant show your vulnerability Just remember that whatever happens you can trust yourself   The overwhelming urge will be to panic become upset and lash out but this will only make things worse Take a minute to relax if you feel like youre about to say something you might regret   Think of anything that you do well and easily even just a routine task like doing the laundry and recall the sense of competence you feel when doing it If you get really angry or upset try counting backwards from ten and taking deep breaths   Remember you have a lot to offer and you can prove this to yourself and to him by acting your best Being friendly polite strong and loving is more effective than just listing the reasons why he should stay Remind him of why he fell for you in the first place

Having a vision of the appearance and abilities of the performers can help you to narrow down your search Of course you dont always have to stick to what youve written down a lot of people change their mind to suit a different person  Mapping out how much time and money you have for your search is crucial since this will give you an idea of which method you should use   This is the way to go if you have very specific criteria or if youre on a low budget Place an advert in The Stage or any other appropriate magazine commonly read by actors seeking employment   This is great if you dont have enough resources andor knowledge for the other methods Just be warned that many hopeful but untalented people will pass through the doors

If youâre new to pop culture youâve likely missed a lot over the past years or even decades Pay attention when people chat about older shows or movies and make a list of the ones that come up most often   If people just drop references without mentioning which show or movie theyâre talking about you may have to ask them If youâre trying to hide your lack of knowledge try to memorize the quote or reference and look that up instead   People love to quote movies and shows to get a laugh or make everyone feel nostalgic There are tons of online lists that rank the best movies and TV shows of all time Check out these lists as well as lists with famous quotations from TV shows and movies   You can also find lists of quotations from specific shows such as The Office or Buffy the Vampire Slayer Words and phrases can become part of pop culture too If youâre feeling confused when you chat with your friends go online to look these things up Urban Dictionary is one option or you can just Google the word or phrase   View your lack of experience with pop culture as a chance to bond with the people youâre close to Donât be embarrassed because theyâll probably be excited they get to bingewatch their favorite shows and movies with you   Netflix is a great place to look for older shows and movies   Thereâs so much that counts as pop culture and itâs impossible to know everything Thatâs ok Start with the most popular stuff and the things your friends are into and then develop your own tastes and interests from there As you become aware of older and newer pop culture youâll catch more and more references
Dont change things around otherwise people wont believe you   Putting in details will make it more convincing also   Youll have to make this up   Usually people would be very loud when seeing people kiss or you could even hear them kiss so it may be less convincing Try picking a place you know you and your crush like or a hangout place   Make sure it matches your story
You are being treated with respect by the man who is asking you out as he values you enough to want to form a more intimate relationship with him So be sure to return that respect Listen carefully and look attentive as he explains his wishes  Smile and nod if its appropriate to do so but wait him out When he finishes and makes it clear that he is waiting for a reply offer your reasons for turning him down
If the horse is inexperienced or untrained its best to attach the lead rope in a round corral This is an easy space to handle the horse where it still has some room to walk away   If the horse is not used to ropes let the animal sniff and investigate it first It may help to rub the rope against your body demonstrating that it is not harmful Let the horse chew on the rope and rub it gently against its nose Praise the horse when it relaxes   If the horse doesnt calm down raise your arms and calmly shoo it away Once the horse calms down and starts chewing or dips its head turn your body and invite it to approach Repeat the exercise with the rope until the horse calms down   If the horse presses its ears back or tries to back away calmly stroke the horse and speak in gentle tones Be gentle and patient until the horse relaxes and lets you put on the halter or clip on the rope Always convince the horse to cooperate instead of forcing the halter on youre never going to win a contest of strength with a horse   If the horse is not fully relaxed after youve clipped on the rope unhook it again and let the horse move away Call it back to you quickly snap the rope on again and praise the horse if it stays calm Repeat until the horse accepts the rope without pulling away   Do not chase after the horse in this situation Its easier to develop trust if the horse comes to you   If the horse will still not relax during this process try attaching a very short rope instead that the horse cant step on while grazing Let the horse walk away with this short rope attached then once theyve calmed down remove the rope and let the horse walk off Repeat until the horse is no longer scared of ropes
This is the easiest and most personal way to make contact with your crush as their secret admirer You can either buy stationary or create your own personalized card that will contain your romantic message   The first time you contact your crush as their Secret Admirer you want to make it clear what your purpose is Pick out a Valentines day card or when making your own use reds and pinks to accentuate the romantic theme  Write clearly and to the point Explain in your own words how you think theyre fantastic and why you admire them so muchDonât talk about yourself This is their time to shine and youâre making that happen by telling them why you think theyâre so special Donât simply say âI like your hairâ or other generic platitudes You want to be sincere unique and specific   Even your handwriting is an detail that might give away your identity For example if you sit beside them in class or in meetings they may know what your penmanship looks like Since youre writing a love note go ahead and also take the time to make your script elegant and legible   If you normally write in print then try writing in cursive Or vice versa if you usually write everything in cursive If youre worried that your handwriting is illegible and your message will be lost then use a computer to type your message and pick a fun font   Make sure that their name is visible on the card That way if the card is delivered in error theres a better chance it will make its way back to your crush You dont want to send a heartfelt note and then find out that they never received itObviously you donât want to use your real name Instead pick a fun pseudonym like the classic âSecret Admirerâ or âYour Valentineâs Day Cupidâ Make sure you are comfortable with revealing yourself to your crush if you want to use your real nameIf you use your real name then youre only an admirer and not a secret one   Depending on your research your crush may prefer daffodils to roses or maybe they love chocolate chip cookies and that would be a perfect surprise on a tough Monday morning Determine what you could give them to make their day a little brighter and attach your card   Donât get too personal Jewelry lingerie expensive items or photos are better for when youâre dating this person not when youre trying to get a relationship started This is the trickiest part of being a Secret Admirer You need to get your card or gift to this person without them knowing it was you Sneak notes in their locker gym bag car window or mailbox Pick a location that your crush frequents regularly so that they see it You could also enlist a friend to be the deliverer The more anonymous you can be the better   Timing is everything You can either start leaving notes and gifts for your crush leading up to Valentines Day or you could use the whole holiday to lavish them with gifts and messages throughout the day If you choose to start wooing your crush before VDay keep your displays of affection to one a day so that you dont spook your crush   You donât just have to give physical gifts to your crush For example if you know theyâll be occupied all day you could wash their car and leave a small note on the windshield from their âSecret Admirerâ If you know this person well you can find out what their needs are and help them out   Instead of giving a gift or as a way to deliver a gift or card you could create a scavenger hunt for them on Valentines Day This method is also a great way to lead your crush to you on the big day   Start by slipping your crush a note with the first clue Write clues that arent so vague that they cant figure them out and leave them in relatively nearby places You dont want your crush running town all day so try and keep things within your school or neighborhood With each clue leave a small gift like a flowers or chocolates Leave the biggest gift or most personal gesture for the end Their excitement will build during the hunt and you want to save the biggest surprise for the grand finale   You want to pique your crushs curiosity just a little bit For example in a note you could say that you love seeing them at the same coffee shop you go to every morning or that you loved their presentation in class the other day Unless you want to string your crush along forever you need to be brave and tell them who you are At some point theyre going to want to know who is responsible for all of the sweet things youâve done for them Choose a convenient time for both you and your crush For example plan on meeting them after their last class of the day for the big reveal   Listen to what theyve been saying about their secret admirer If it sounds like theyre excited to find out who it is then its time to reveal yourself If they donât seem interested you may want to stop You canât control another personâs feelings and you should be respectful if theyre feeling creeped out   Coffee shops parks and restaurants are all good starts because there will be people around but not so many that you wont have privacy Remember you dont want to scare your crush away so pick somewhere relaxing A bench in a park can be a beautiful setting but a dark movie theatre will make you seem like a stalker and not an admirer You could write a note that says something like âIâll be wearing a red shirt and sunglassesâ Even though youâre trying to convey an air of mystery you need to be clear in your directions so that your crush can actually identify you   If youâre already involved in this personâs life they may recognize you However this is your moment to show them that youre their mysterious and sweet admirer After the big reveal follow up by asking them on an official date so that you can continue to get to know each other   Chances are you know this person a little bit already You probably have a few reason already as to why you admire them However you will need to know a few more details in order to do things for them and not get caught If you donât know your crush too well survey the people who are close to them You can either ask innocent questions in a conversation or ask them outright what your crush likes and dislikes or what their class schedule looks like   Be careful when talking with friends and family or your crush If your crush starts to ask around trying to find out your identity a friend might accidentally slip up For example they could comment that youve been asking about your crush a lot and then your cover would be blown It may be better to tell the people youre surveying that youre going to be your crushs secret admirer if you think they can keep a secret That way you have someone on the inside who can help you out   You shouldnât know when they brush their teeth every day but itâs good to know if theyâre busy in gym class or in a meeting That way you can plan when youâre going to leave little surprises for them without being seen or getting caught   In other words donât be creepy If you need to do a little research to find out their favorite candy thatâs fine But donât dig so deep that you find out their shoe size and their pets name Do some preliminary research so that you can deliver them heartfelt notes but you should really get to know them personally once you reveal your identity Decide what your end goal is If you want to go on a date with this person on Valentines Day then you need to start wooing them a few weeks before Or if you want to just surprise them for one day you can create a more elaborate onetime plan For instance you could have your crush go on a daylong scavenger hunt on Valentines Day that leads up to them meeting you that evening for a date
Remember friends ALWAYS make you laugh If you want to get over it you have to be with your friends so they can help you forget about it and make you feel better  It always helps   Erase his phone number There is no sense in having it anymore if you want to make a true finished clean break   Cry scream and feel sorry for yourself Wallow in selfpity However one day while you are wallowing you will suddenly say Hey I dont feel like wallowing anymore today I feel better And the next day you will feel better and each day after that you will feel even better Soon something amazing happens you rediscover your smile and actually laugh at who you were back then Suddenly you are thankful for what the experience taught you   A great piece was posted here on the Breaking Up is Hard to Do board a while ago I kept it and I read it every morning when I sit at my desk The first line is Promise yourself to be so strong that nothing can disturb you For me that has worked Reading a simple little piece someone posted has made such a great impact on how I view it all It does get better and within a couple of weeks the hurt goes away   If you think you are beaten you are If you think you dare not you dont Success begins with your own will Its all in your state of mind Lifes battles are not always won by those who are stronger or faster Sooner or later the person who wins is the person who thinks he can   In the beginning of a breakup you might want to show people that you are fine This might cause you to go out and act as though you are moving on full swing You might even start dating immediately If the relationship meant a great deal to you then you are going to need time to mourn the loss of it Never assume you need to apologize for feeling bad about your new path in life As a relationship ends you will need to grieve Take time to get past the emotions of anger sadness and loss Once you can accept where you are and that the relationship is in the past then maybe you are ready for a new relationship   This will let you concentrate on something new and interesting and get you out of the circular thought process you may or may not develop thinking about your ex too much   Turn up your favorite music and dance like nobodys looking Whether you like bubblegum pop or screamo youll let out some stress
Just run up to himher and say hi then ask them if they want to sit with you at lunch or something similar Dont flirt with himher though Heshe may already be in a relationship you never know Youre aiming to get to know them as a friend not a girlboy friend If you cant come up with the courage to just walk up to him then pretend you are doing something for class and you need to talk to himher about the homework or lesson You could try telling them you have to complete a class survey which can be a really good way to find some information about the person though it can be kind of risky if they find out there is really no assignment  While this may work in emergency situations long awkward silences it doesnt give the impression that you want to know himher as a person Ask questions Get to know them Find out if you really do like himher after all or if the crush is only skindeep   If you dont get something call him or text him and ask for help This will show that you think they are intelligent If you think you have lots of trust built up ask them to come over to your house and explain something to you   Tell himher some of your secrets invite himher to places as friends and just do things you normally do with your friends   You dont need to fake anything Youre just trying to get himher as a friend   Buy himher cute gifts see hisher games if hesshes in sports and just visit himher occasionally   It might make himher feel uncomfortable   And dont gush about feelings or problems theyll start to think you are overexcited
Once youve given yourself enough time to mourn your relationship its time to slowly ease back into the world Your family members should be some of the most accepting and loving people in your life and they will be for you when youre trying to fix your broken heart Heres what to do   Try to see your family as much as you can If your family members live far away this could be a good time to take a weeklong vacation to see them If cant see your family members talk to them Let them know how youre feeling and let them comfort you If theres something you used to love doing with your family such as baking pies or watching football on Sundays pick that up again if you can Ask your family members for advice Though your family members may love you so much that they may say anything to make you feel better ask them about how to deal with a broken heart   Though your family may have known you the longest your close friends may have the best understanding of you and your relationship Theyve probably met your significant other have heard you discuss your problems and have a helpful perspective Heres how to do it   Once you feel up to it try to hang out with your close friends as often as you can Even if you feel like youre being a drag your close friends will make you laugh and will take your mind off of your recent heartbreak Use this as an opportunity to take the fun friend trip you and your friends have been talking about forever Whether youre flying to Mexico or just driving to a new beach sometimes a change of scenery with your closest friends can help you feel less broken Just be plain silly Invite your friends to an 80sthemed sleepover or a dance party Just dont forget that your friends have their limits and their patience can wear thin If you spend all of your time together whining and crying about your broken heart they may not pick up the next time you call Hanging out with your closest friends will help the healing process but try to avoid hanging out with too many couples Even if your couple friends make a point of not being extra lovey around you you may still feel left out and even more alone if youre surrounded by people who are in love You can talk to your friends about your breakup but stop when youve gone over the same scenario so many times that youre not getting anywhere and its making you sick This can actually make you feel worse   If you were in a committed relationship for a long time then chances are that you left a few friends by the wayside because you didnt have enough time to pursue your relationship along with so many friendships Heres what you can do   If you found out that an old friend from high school or college just moved into your neighborhood dont be afraid to get in touch You can reconnect and find that your relationship is even stronger than ever If you stopped talking to a close friend a while after she moved away from you use this time to call her up and see how shes doing You will find that youve missed many things about your relationship If one of your old friends moved abroad write him or her a letter This will help you reconnect and reflect in the process
You have nothing to prove and nothing to lose Kissing is a two way street and the guy is probably more nervous than you are Take deep breaths but dont make it too obvious that youre trying to calm yourself down Passionate kissing can be frenzied calm and meditative or anywhere in between There is an unspoken process where both parties will try to match the type of passion the other is aching for   It helps to synchronize breathing rates A good way to begin building sexual tension is to keep him talking Be in a location that is secluded Having the option to sit is an extra bonus Just keep a conversation no matter how mundane it feels The bleaker the conversation the higher your chances are that hes thinking about kissing you   A great way to signal that youre ready to kiss is to go back and forth from looking at his eyes and his lips This will create tension that is necessary to have a truly passionate kiss If he repeats and looks at your lips he is ready for those kissing sparks to fly   There are ways of being sly about getting close to him but you want this move to be obvious This is another clue for him to know that you want to start kissingIt will help if your bodies are slightly touching Even if your body contact is ever so slight it will feel exciting   Try and keep the conversation going and touch him on the thigh or his arm Another good spot to excite and comfort him is to put your hand behind his neck Be sure to keep your eyes fixed on his eyes but take quick glances at his lips   Tilt your head slightly and move close to his face and pause right before you reach his face You shouldnt do all the work but initiating the kiss yourself will excite him It isnt as popular for the girl to make the first move but there isnt a rule book to kissing
Even though you are seeing each other frequently and going out on dates the other person canât be sure of your intentions unless you tell them Let the person know that you are ready and interested in a relationship You should also be willing to hear whether they want the same thing or notFor example you could say âWeâve been going out for a while and I know that we both enjoy being around each other I just wanted to let you know that I am interested in a serious relationship when the time is right for both of usâ   Once you agree to be in a relationship there are certain rules that come with that The tricky part is that these rules are not the same for every person or couple You should both sit down and discuss what boundaries you expect to be followed in the relationshipFor example your partner might be okay with staying friends with exes while that makes you uncomfortable You discuss both sides and agree on a set of boundaries that makes you both comfortable Creating boundaries can help you to find a happy medium between what makes you comfortable and what makes your partner comfortable For example you might agree that being friends with exes is okay but constantly communicating with them is crossing the line   One of the hardest things about a relationship is that both people must be willing to compromise to make it work That means you will have to do some things that you donât like and so will the other person Keep an open line of communication about the relationship and make sure that both people are giving and takingFor example you might both hate doing dishes and laundry As a compromise one of you could do dishes and the other do laundry Work to keep your lines of communication open throughout the course of your relationship Unspoken issues may arise and create even larger problems later on if not addressed
Be clear with your answer but still flirtatious For example if they ask Whats for homework simply answer with the list of whats for homework and coyly add that they should email or call if they need some help with it   Youve got em but make sure they like you back before mentioning something personal or intimate   Dont continuously check your email It may just make you feel desperate and less confident
Talk about something he likes  TV shows movies sports his hobbies etc Make sure to be calm and casual yet still appear interested  Here give me your number and Ill call you later Dont be frantic and crazy when you say this Remain serene as if you do this all the time   We can just talk in person tomorrow Dont let it get to you if he says no Some guys just arent comfortable with that However if he says no wait a while before you try asking again Otherwise hell catch on   Just say thanks and smile for now You can get excited later
Many people feel they should be coy or standoffish with a boy they like However if a guy is interested in you as well he will appreciate you being upfront Also people tend to be attracted to confidence Approach him without hesitanceMake conversation with him whenever you can to demonstrate your feelings For example if you see him between class walk up to him and say Hi Make conversation about things like school and homework Do not be afraid to text him if you have his number He gave it to you for a reason so dont hesitate to send him a message when you feel like it Keep in mind that if a guy does not like you he may get frustrated if you give him too much extra affection Pay attention to how he reacts If he tends to pay attention to you in return he may have feelings as well If he seems disengaged you may want to give him space and move on   If you want someone to feel like you like them show them you want to get to know them Make a point of asking him about whats going on with him Listen to what he says to convey genuine curiosityAsk him about his life when you see him Ask how his day is going or ask about something specific For example if you know he had a big test in physics say something like How did your test go Truly listen when he responds Do not interrupt or talk over him Instead pay attention to what hes saying while maintaining eye contact and nodding when appropriate   This is something small you can do to show youre invested If the two of you are out say getting coffee paying for something can be a great way to show you want this to be a date This can help the guy see your feelings Pay for his movie tickets if you see a film or his espresso when youre getting coffeeThis can help make it clear a gettogether is a date Going out for coffee may seem friendly but if you offer to pay the guy may get the message its a date   If you like a guy you make this clear by becoming his personal cheerleader Supporting someones success can show your investment in them Its a great way to make your feelings knownFor example if he plays a sport show up to his game to cheer You can even make a sign cheering him on specifically If hes struggling in a class and does great on a test be the first to congratulate him Say something like I knew you would get a good grade Awesome job   Its often best just to tell someone about your feelings If the guy does not seem to be getting the hint via your actions make a point of telling him directly Even if he does not feel the same way you will have closure and will be able to proceed one way or anotherMake it simple Wait until the two of you are alone Say something like Can we talk about something Be clear about your feelings For example say I just wanted you to know I have feelings for you I thought it would be best just to put it out there Remember rejection hurts but it happens to everyone If he doesnt feel the same way take some time to grieve before you move on There are many other people out there and you will find the right person eventually

The withers of the horse is the high point above the shoulder blades along the back There three general types of withers which determine the length and rocker angle of the saddle   Defined withers are recognizable by a definite high point and then a gentle slope back to the croup Most âregularâ or âmediumâ saddles will fit this type of horse Rounded withers occur when just as it sounds the withers are gently sloped and the horse has a more flat back The withers are typically a bit more flat as well requiring a wider saddle tree   The topline of the horse is the shapecurve of the back from the withers to the croup The topline has four primary build types level straight swayback and downhill Each build will require a different saddle build or the use of special saddle pads   A level topline can be recognized when a horse has withers and croup that are about the same height and lacks a large dip between the two Most regular saddles will fit this topline build A straight back is most common in mules but it sometimes seen in horses Straight backs occur when the withers and croup are fairly low and donât have much of a dip between the two From the side their entire back will be almost level This requires a special âstraightâ saddle built with bars that lack much of a rocker angle Swayback horses have incredibly prominent narrow withers and a prominent croup This typically occurs in horses that are poorly conditioned or that are very old and makes it so that the saddle cannot sit flat against the back it balances between the withers and croup Special pads can be added to fix this problem A downhill topline occurs when the croup of the horse is slightly higher than the withers causing the saddle to tip forward You can get a saddle adjusted with more flocking near the front to balance it out or you can use special pads under the pommelfork to force the saddle upright   A âregularâ saddle is built to fit a horse with an average length back A special saddle is not needed for a horse with a very long back in most cases but if your horse has a short back the skirt of the saddle the leather flaps on either side might dig into them causing pain and irritation If your horse is very small you may need to get a special âsmallâ saddle to fit their back If youâre buying a saddle for a very young or unconditioned horse realize that you will likely have to buy a new one in a year or two to fit their growing body On the other hand if your horse is very old or overweight you might need to get another saddle after a year or two to compensate for a lot of weight loss

Pay attention to if she has broken the touch barrier with you If she has you need to figure out if it is friendly or flirty She might just be giving you a friendly pat on the shoulder or she might be flirting with you because she is interested in you If she touches you often it might be a sign that she is flirting   The amount of time she touches you for is an aspect of what determines if the touching is flirty or friendly Was the touch a quick brush or does her hand linger for a few seconds Where she touches you could be a sign of what the touch means Touching your shoulder might be something she does with friends whereas touching your hand or face could be a sign she is interested in you Notice if she reciprocates your touch If you give her a side hug and she leans into it she might like you If she seems uncomfortable and pulls away from the hug maybe not   If she gives you space when she talks to you she might not like you If she turns her body toward you and points her feet your way she could be interested Some women get nervous around guys they like Touching her hair and neck are signs she is feeling jittery and nervous around you and might be interested in you  Some women look at the guy they like often If she likes you she wonât be able to help but look at you If you notice a lot of eye contact from her when you talk to her she might be interested in you If you know she is the kind of girl to get shy and nervous she might be doing the opposite and not looking at you at all This could also mean she likes you  If every time she is with her boyfriend she has a huge smile on her face it might be a sign you should back off If she always looks miserable with him then maybe there is room in her heart to develop feelings for someone else Paying attention to how she acts around her boyfriend might help you figure out how she feels about you but it also might not mean anything If she her look sad with her boyfriend it does not necessarily mean she does not love him or that she wants to be with you

The saddle blanket protects the horses body from friction from the leather saddle and is vital for a safe ride It also keeps the saddle clean from the horses body which will sweat and froth with the exertion of a rideIf you donât have a blanket you need one to properly tack your horse   You can get a saddle blanket at any farming supply or agriculture store You can choose a traditional woven blanket which is folded in half for use or you can buy a felt or cotton pad which is less likely to bunch under the saddle or catch burrs if you ride in a fieldBe sure you brush the horse and ensure there are no burrs in its coat or any injuries to its skinPosition the blanket slightly over the horses withers the ridge between its shoulder blades First put the blanket down a bit too far toward the neck then pull it back toward the horses tail until its in the correct position This method smooths the hair under the blanket so that it lies flat and doesnt itch or bother the animal  This process might seem cumbersome and can take some practice before it becomes easy especially if youre used to the English saddle which has less straps and other things dangling down   Stand next to the horses left shoulder and keep your feet shoulderwidth apart Hook the right stirrup up over the saddle horn so that it wont get caught under the saddle as you lift it then swing the saddle up and over the horses back so that your right arm is across the horses backBe sure to practice good lifting techniques to avoid injury to your back or leg muscles saddles can weigh from 1035 pounds and swinging it without proper posture could injure your muscles or joints As you put the saddle over the blanket be sure that you grab the stirrups the leather loops for the riders feet cinches and straps any leather hanging down and hold them out of the way so that they dont get stuck under the saddleThe process of getting the saddle and blanket in the right place might cause them both to slide too far back in that case start over with the blanket first   This is the side you have been standing on to put the blanket and saddle on   You can keep the left stirrup up over the saddle horn the knob on top of the saddle for the rider to hold for better access but bring the tie down to the horses side
At the end of any relationship there will be a period of grieving You have suffered a loss and so for a while you are going to feel deeply sad Accept and allow this Take some time to cry and process what has happenedWith major emotional experiences psychologists say that our firsts are usually more memorable and continue to have emotional power throughout our lives This means its going to take some time to get over your ex It also means you will probably never forget himRather than trying to forget just accept your feelings as they are  By the same token while emotional firsts are powerful it is possible to exaggerate their importance In our culture losing ones virginity is often viewed as a major turning point in life but for most people it really isnt a defining momentAfter youve had a few days to grieve try to put things in perspective You are the same person you were before you lost your virginity Keep in mind too that you get to define what the important romantic and sexual moments in your life are If you dont want to look back at this as the sexual experience of your life you dont have to Youve had one experience with one person but a different type of sexual experience with someone else may be more special later The big moment for you may not have happened yet   For many people when a relationship ends there is a tendency to think negative thoughts about themselves This is especially true if you are not the person who chose to end the relationship These feelings of rejection can lead to negative selftalkIf you feel rejected by your ex you might be telling yourself it happened because you are not good enough or not attractive enough You might be telling yourself you wont find happiness again If youve lost your virginity to someone and then been rejected these ideas can be hard to push aside If you notice yourself thinking these thoughts try to replace them with more positive ideas Your ex may not want to be with you anymore but others will Her rejection of you doesnt make you a lesser person in any way   When youre ready to start thinking about the future there are two realities you should try to keep in mind First you will find happiness again Second you and your ex must go your own waysTry to be realistic about your possibilities for future happiness You were happy before this happened and you will be happy again In your life you will love other people Try not to dwell on thoughts about getting back together with your ex someday Young love is powerful but in most cases doesnt last You and your ex are both at a point in your lives where you are changing quickly and still discovering who you are These changes usually push young people apart Its no ones fault and all you can do about it is move on with your life and allow your ex to do the same   For your own sake try to limit the amount of time you spend grieving your ex After a few days if you can start setting your grief apart from other parts of your life you can start to get past itFor example you might decided that you are going to spend no more than an hour a day grieving your loss Maybe youll set aside two blocks of 30 minutes where you allow yourself to really feel the pain but after that go do something else that will keep your mind occupied After a while try cutting down to two 15 minute blocks Some people find that putting their pain in an imaginary box that they open on a routine schedule starts to make that pain boring Eventually this can help you to lose interest in these sad feelings and get on with life
Even if you dont feel very confident take a minute to build yourself up before approaching a a potential date Envision the conversation going well in your mind If you are going into a conversation expecting to be rejected it will show in your body language Make sure you make eye contact and stand up straight and speak clearly   Sometimes a drink or two might be necessary to loosen up your inhibitions enough to talk to a good looking guy but know when to stop Going over the line can lead to some embarrassing situations Drinking too much impairs your judgement including your ability to decide if you have met your dream guy or not   Nothing will make you seem more lonely and desperate than revealing everything about your past right away You dont want to seem like youre on the rebound and desperate to feel validated Just because you met a good looking guy at a party and feel like you can talk to him all night does not mean you should This is the time where you excuse yourself Spend some time talking with your friends or meet some other new people Just be patient and make your way back in bit Leaving them wanting more and let them see your whole life isnt going to crumble the second you stop talking together
If you want to play a player you have to get his attention Do you get his attention by fawning all over him running your hands through this hair and telling him how hot he is Absolutely not To play a player you have to start off by completely ignoring him  be an ice queen if you have to If he walks into a room and tries to charm you and your girls look away stare into your drink or barely say hi before you check your phone or disappear to the girls room   Hell notice you precisely because you didnt notice him Players expect to be worshipped by every woman around and hell wonder why his magic didnt work on you You dont have to be outright rude to him Just look completely uninterested like you have better things to do than to talk to him But that doesnt mean you should insult him or call him names either  After a while whether its a few weeks later at the same party or a few hours later at the same bar you can start to open up a bit You should let him know you see him but just enough to make him curious and to want to get to know you and win you over You can do this by introducing yourself repeating his name when he introduces himself or by smiling at him from across the room   Dont let him make you laugh ask you to dance or lavish you with complements If he insists on buying you a drink you can let him but dont let it be an excuse for him to spend the night trying to charm you Take the drink thank him and walk away   Now that youve got his attention and have shown some minimal interest in him you need to remind him that you have better things to do than to be with him Let him see you having a good time with your girls by laughing it up with them hitting up the dance floor with them or just having a general good time without him   You can do this anywhere not just out at a bar If the player is in your school or someone from town let him see you having fun with your girls no matter what youre doing whether its eating lunch or going shopping Just make one thing clear you do not need him   To reinforce the idea that you dont really need the player in your life let him see you hanging out with other guys Whether youre hanging out with your guy friends or if another guy is showing interest in you you should let him see that every guy wants some of your time and that you like all of the attention  as long as its not from him   Just by chatting or laughing with other guys youll be showing him that you dont need him You dont have to grind with another guy on the dance floor to show that hes not needed Dont look over at the player to make sure that he sees you having a great time He shouldnt even consider that youre trying to get his attention by ignoring him   Once youve acknowledged the guy only to mostly ignore him with your girlfriends and other guys in your life its time to reel him back in again After you think youve driven him crazy enough its time to have a quick flirtatious conversation where you let him fawn all over you and show him that you may be interested   Play it cool Dont flatter him Just let him know that you like talking to him Keep things light and fun Thatll make him want to talk to you more Tease him a little bit Dont let him take himself too seriously or think hes all that   Let him see that while you like flirting with him youre not going to fall for his usual ladykilling tactics You can make fun of him call him Romeo or refer to the pack of girls behind him as his girlfriends This will only drive him crazy and make him want to prove how different he is   If you dont let him charm you or flatter you hell only become more persistent Thats exactly what he wants

In order to potty train your bird you need to pay attention to how it behaves right before it goes to the bathroom You should also take note of how often it uses the bathroom This way you will know when to and how often to carry your bird to the bathroom areaMost parrots will squat down slightly and flick their tails up when theyre ready to go to the bathroom Watch your bird to see what precise movements it makes when its getting ready to go Also keep track of how often your bird defecates Parrots can defecate as often as every 15 minutes This way youll know roughly how often youll need to direct your bird to the bathroom area  You want a command to reinforce the behavior You want to be able to say something when you see your bird squatting that will alert it that it needs to go to the bathroom area Pick something simple like Go potty to teach your bird where to use the bathroom You should have an area in your parrots cage where it can go to the bathroom Most people use something like a waste basket or lay down paper towels or newspaper in a certain portion of their home You can also use paper plates Make sure you pick a space the bird can easily access on its own Watch your bird when its out of its cage Remember the natural behaviors you noticed that indicated the bird needed to use the bathroom If you see the bird doing things that indicates it needs to go like squatting or flicking its tail immediately move the bird to the bathroom areaAt first you will need to use the step up command to get your bird to climb on your arm or finger Then take your bird to the potty spot and hold it over the spot until it goes to the bathroom Watch your bird closely When it defecates say your command This will help your bird make the connection It will realize its supposed to go to the bathroom in the bathroom areaSome people use commands like Hurry up if their bird is taking a while to relieve itself For example if your bird has been standing on the potty area for a while you can say something like Hurry up and reward your bird as soon as it goes to the bathroom   Each time the bird goes in the bathroom spot give it a reward Parrots respond best to positive reinforcement Offer a treat and praise when the bird successfully goes to the bathroom in the right spot Choose a specific treat your parrot only gets for using the bathroom so the parrot understands what its being rewarded forYou can also reward your bird by letting it out of the cage for a few minutes each time it goes to the bathroom in the proper spot Then put it back in its cage until it goes to the bathroom in the right spot again   Watch your bird closely both inside and outside of its cage As soon as your bird begins squatting take it to the potty spot Do this for a few weeks until your bird knows where to relieve itself Always say the command and reward your bird for going in the right spotBe patient It can be time consuming to be moving the bird to the bathroom area every 10 to 15 minutes but most birds will eventually learn the behavior   If you just got a parrot it will need time to adjust to your home Potty training or any kind of training can be overwhelming if done too early Spend some time letting your bird adjust Once your bird is calm and friendly with you you can begin trainingHow long your bird needs to relax depends on the temperament of the bird Some birds come around right away while others need a lot of time   You cannot expect a bird to learn right away It will take time and consistency for your parrot to be toilet trained Even then you can expect some occasional accidents Keep these expectations in mind so you do not get angry or frustrated while training your parrot Scolding or striking your parrot will not result in it learning faster In fact this will only stress out your bird High levels of stress can cause behavioral problems Even if your bird is not behaving how you want you should never hit or scold it

To do this put your guinea pig in a safe areasuch as its cageand click the clicker or say the verbal marker A second or so after clicking the clicker give your guinea pig a treat Repeat this several times until you think your guinea pig understands what the click or marker means   Occasionally this will take a long time To see if your guinea pig is properly conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker act normal for several minutes talking and playing with the guinea pig and then suddenly click the clicker or say the marker clearly and firmly If your guinea pig looks at you expecting a treat they have been properly conditioned and you can move on with training If they keep about their business they do not yet understand what the marker means and need to be worked with on conditioning a bit more Dont be discouraged if your guinea pig does this   Skittish hyper stubborn or impatient guinea pigs will be more difficult to train It takes a lot of patience to get your guinea pig to learn a trick and often times they will respond to a hand motion rather than a wordfor example if you were teaching your guinea pig to stand up it would be easier for them to grasp if you held your finger over their head as an indication to do the trick in contrast to just saying stand up   Many people before beginning to train their guinea pigs work on targeting Teaching targeting to a guinea pig is quite simpleto do so hold a finger or some kind of long stick somewhere a few inches away from your guinea pig and wait As soon as they get near the finger or stick and touch it click or say the marker and treat Do this about twenty or thirty times or until your guinea pig touches it efficiently several times in a row This may make training much easier   There are several different methods and some are easier than others Try to get your guinea pig out for at least one 510 minute session each day If either you or the pig become frustrated treat and put them back in their cage for a little while   Keep in mind that guinea pigs brains work differently than a cats or dogs so they may not process information as quickly as a larger animal Patience is key
Over communicating with a person can be just as destructive to a relationship as failing to communicate with that person Make yourself appear needy and insecure by constantly checkin with them via phone call text or direct message Further your cause by contacting them at inappropriate times such as in the middle of class a meeting or a family meal This will demonstrate that you have little respect for boundaries With each passing day that you blow up their phone they may fall more and more out of love with you Partners accepting of each otherâs flaws and quirks Cast yourself in a shallow and unflattering light by nitpicking every action and decision made by the person who loves you Criticize their hair clothing movie selection career choice and car Your incessant negativity may just drive them away In many relationships partners are able to retain some degree of autonomy over their own life Deny the person you wish to drive away the ability to make a decision without consulting you first Your domineering facade may motivate them to cut ties with you so that they can regain control of their life
A large cage is important because it gives your guinea pig a large area to explore The larger the cage is the better off your guinea pig will be At a minimum each guinea pig should have 75 square feet of cageThats a cage thats approximately 3 by 25 feet If you can go for a bigger cage so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage   You can buy a cage for a guinea pig However most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough You can find ones meant for other animals though that will work for guinea pigs Pick one that has metal bars on the side not wood as guinea pigs cant chew through metalAlso make sure it has a solid floor Guinea pigs feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig Go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels Floor space is more important   Another option is making your own You can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath One option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast available from sign making shopsStart with cube grids Cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward cage Cut the correx or coroplast to fit You can use the material as a floor then use more of it to create a border around the floor Tape it together from the outside Add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage

One thing you can do around guys is to look for things you have in common so you can get an interesting conversation going It doesnât have to be super deep and can be as simple as your mutual affection for Community or your lifelong love for the Cubs Look at the guyâs clothes binders or notebooks for clues about what you may have in common and start a lighthearted discussion about it   You donât have to find it immediately If you get a guy talking for a few minutes or more youâll be able to latch on to something pretty soon This is better than coming right out and asking him what all of his favorite bands hobbies or movies are though you can get around to that eventually You can also check out a guyâs Facebook profile for hints of the stuff he likes if youâre nervous about striking up a conversation  Though âbe yourselfâ may sound like super corny advice it can be the best advice you get If you really want guys to like you and to get to know you then all you can do is to be the person you were meant to be Of course if you want to wait for them to really get to know you or avoid topics that may be more suited for your girlfriends thatâs fine but you shouldnât change who you are just to fit an idea of what the guys may expect you to do or say   When you talk to a guy donât act like a version of a girl you think he might like more and donât try to mimic one of the most popular girls in your high school This wonât get you nearly as far as sharing your true self with others If youâre more shy you donât have to put it all out there at once Just open up to guys little by little as you become friends with them   You can wear whatever makes you feel good If you like babydoll dresses then wear them all you want If youâre into leggings and long shirts skirts and tanktops or jeans and tshirts then thatâs fine too You shouldnât wear clothes that are tighter or more revealing than youâre comfortable with just to fit an image of what you think guys are into Youâll look the best when youâre clearly comfortable with what youâre wearing   Donât feel like youâre limited to one style or image whether youâre more grungy or super girly You can rock leather jeans one week and a pink babydoll dress the next What matters is that you feel like yourself in whatever you wear   You may think that guys will think youâre cool if youâre mean to people whom you deem unworthy of you or somehow inferior but in fact the best thing to do is to be friendly to everyone around unless they give you a reason not to be Whether youâre talking to the quiet guy in your homeroom for the first time or striking up a conversation with the new guy in school make a point of having a smile on your face asking questions and being friendly Guys will see that youâre a person they want to be around   If youâre more shy then you donât have to suddenly become super outgoing But you should make an effort to at least smile and wave at people and to introduce yourself to new people when you can   If you want to have a great time hanging out with guys then you have to show that you really care about them whether you like them romantically or not Just show that you care by asking them questions about their lives complimenting them looking like you care about how theyâre feeling and making eye contact when you talk to them Donât switch the conversation to yourself every chance you get or keep checking your phone when theyâre trying to talk to you Instead take the time to let them know they matter   Of course it can be tricky to let a guy know you care about him when you donât have romantic feelings for him Just be fun and friendly and make it clear that youâre only looking for friendship   You may think that every girl but you is feeling confident about who she is what she does and how she looks However youâd be surprised by just how many girls are plagued by insecurity and try to mask it with a big smile or a mean attitude You can be better than that Work on loving the person who you are being kind to the people around you and feeling capable of doing anything If you have a positive attitude and a great energy then guys will like being around you   Donât talk about how much weight you need to lose or how much you hate being tall Instead focus on the things you like about yourself Of course it can take years to truly love yourself But you can take steps in this direction by accepting what you canât change and working on changing what you can   You donât want to change who you are just to get the attention of a guy especially if it means pretending to love Star Wars or talking about a band you canât stand for hours Talk about your favorite TV shows a great movie you just saw the hobby you most care about or really any of the things you care about and guys will be drawn to your passion Think about it as not being different from talking to your girlfriends about everyday things â except that you can avoid talking about the guys you like   The subject of your conversation is less important than making sure that you and the guys you talk to maintain a fair balance between talking and listening Try not to dominate any conversation and leave room for other people to talk If youâre talking to a guy oneonone try not to do more than about half the talking   Though itâs important to feel comfortable actually talking about the things that matter to you you should also be able to get a sense of when a guy is starting to lose interest If youâve been talking about your horse for twenty minutes and you see the guy shifting on his feet checking his phone or looking around for a friend who can give him a save then you can shift subjects by asking him a question instead   Learn to read body language and facial expressions to see whether or not a guy is listening to you If heâs listening heâll be making eye contact unless heâs super shy or has a crush on you and turning his body toward you instead of away   One thing you can do is to offer a subtle compliment to a guy from time to time You donât have to tell him he has the worldâs most beautiful eyes or that heâs a big hunk but you can compliment a new shirt the guy is wearing tell him he did great in yesterdayâs basketball game or just make a kind lighthearted comment that lets the guy know you care You donât have to actually have a crush on the guy to give him a compliment either   You can say something like âYouâre so good at chemistry How do you do itâ Or âYou have such a unique laugh I could tell it was you from the other side of the hallâ   If you want to have a good time hanging out with guys then you should ask them about themselves from time to time without interrogating them You can get to know them little by little and show that you care about the things that matter to them You donât need to interview them but you should ask them a question or two in the course of a conversation Here are some things you can ask them about to show them you care   Their favorite bands Their hobbies Their favorite TV shows movies or actors Their weekend plans Their pets   Guys like girls who donât take themselves too seriously While itâs not attractive to actually put yourself down or to make fun of yourself in a real way like saying that youâre fat that youâre stupid or that you hate something about yourself some light humor can show that youâre a fun easygoing person This is different from badmouthing yourself in hopes that someone will give you some attention just learn to laugh at yourself and the rest of your life will be much easier   For example you can make a comment like âBig surprise I tripped againâ or âI wonder how many more pink sweaters I can wearâ to show guys that youâre aware of your goofy or endearing qualities while not being committed to perfection   If you would describe yourself as a girly girl like to wear dresses and emphasize your feminine qualities then you should keep doing that But if youâre more of a tomboy then you should be proud to be who you are and not try to giggle more than usual play with your hair more than usual or just change who you are to be more girly because you think thatâs what guys want The most important thing is that you act like yourself and guys will be impressed   You can also mix it up If youâre more of a tomboy but want to put on a dress or a skirt once in a while no one is stopping you   If you have a crush on a guy and have something to say to him about it then make sure you do it yourself Sure itâs easier and less stressful to have one of your friends talk to the guy for you to tell him what youâre thinking but if you do it yourself youâll start an easier flow of communication and the guy will be impressed by your confidence The worst that can happen is that he may not return your feelings but at least youâll have the satisfaction of knowing that you had the courage to talk to him to begin with   If youâre really shy about telling a guy you like him in person you can pass him a note or talk to him online The most important thing is that itâs coming from you directly   Again another misconception girls have about how to act around guys is that they want girls who are laughing all the time Of course if the guy youâre around is genuinely funny you can laugh all you want but you should avoid laughing if youâre doing it only because you think itâll make people like you more You can laugh but you should also have jokes of your own to share too You donât want people to think youâre just a laugh track   When a guy is genuinely funny you can crack up all you want But you should avoid doing it just because you think it makes you look cute   You may also think that guys like girls who talk about how much money their purse cost which celebrities are following them on Twitter or other things that may superficially make you more interesting Instead talk about the things you actually care about and guys will be impressed If you do something that is worth bragging about then the guys will find out some other way because other people will be praising you   Just work on being the best person you can be and guys will be impressed by what you do whether youâre amazing at learning foreign languages or have an unstoppable tennis serve   You may think that guys will think itâs funny if you put other girls down or talk about the random drama youâre experiencing However most guys actually prefer girls who are chill and who donât complain about their friends and who donât feel the need to put other people down just to feel better about themselves If you actually say nice things about girls who arenât there and avoid gossip guys will like you more because theyâll see that youâre easygoing and drama free and will be drawn to you   If you put down other girls then itâll be a sign of your insecurity and guys will see that youâre only doing it to try to make yourself look better Instead praise other girls to show how comfortable you are with what you have to offer
Once you start spending time with your crush you can start sending signals that you like him This is another place you can let your eyes do the talking   At this point you should start making eye contact with your crush for a couple of seconds gazing and then looking away See if they do it back Dont keep eye contact for too long It can be creepy   After you make eye contact with your crush smile to yourself Dont make it a giant grin you dont want to seem too excited But a little smile lets your crush know youre happy theyre paying attention to you   However you decide to flirt with your crush its important to be yourself Dont pretend to be someone else to please your crush Theyll never truly like you if they dont know the real you   Also dont try too hard on the flirting Dont over think it Giving your crush tons of compliments laughing at every joke he or she makes or constantly trying to bat your eyelashes or strike handsome poses will not seem genuine No matter how stressful this is try to to just be calm and be your real self   After youve gotten to know your crush if he or she seems to react well to your flirting try touching him or her in playful way For example   When your crush makes a joke laugh and lightly touch his or her arm or hand Another thing is to lightly punch him on the arm If you are walking past your crush in a hallway or somewhere like that try lightly brushing your shoulder against theirs Make it look accidental Lightly wiggle your fingers on your crushs hand or arm Stand close to your crush But dont make him or her feel uncomfortable If they move away respect their space Hold your crushs hand to lead him or her to places When youre next to your crush rub your fingers on his or her wrist to tickle it Give your crush a hug when saying hello or goodbye If you think your crush is starting to like you back kiss their cheek to see their reaction However if your crush hasnt shown signs of interest in you do not try this If they have shown signs of interest take the risk and try it when you two are alone
Literally remove yourself from her The more you see your ex in person the more difficult it will be to forget about her and the pain she has caused you Find ways to change your routine so that you are not forced to confront her   Avoid places that you know she frequents This may include her favorite restaurants and coffee shops or shops near where she lives Avoid social gatherings that you know she will be at This will only cause unnecessary tension and cause you to obsess over the past If you are both invited to a party or event tell the host that you are busy Missing a few social gatherings is worth the jealousy and frustration that you will feel if you see her again  Remove any of her belongings from your room Get rid of anything you deeply associate with herIt will only bring you unnecessary pain to hang onto any souvenirs from the relationship   Do not allow yourself to contact her including through text or email It may be tempting to engage with her at first but this will only open up the door to more pain and conflict The more you communicate with your ex the harder it will be to forget her   Consider unfriending or unfollowing her on social media Social media allows us to paint a positive picture of our lives Such images of her will only make you nostalgic about the relationship If this feels too drastic consider removing her from your news feed or phone contact list  If you share a friend group spend time with a new social circle   Reconnect with the friends you had before you met her They are friends with you outside of the context of your relationship with your ex They will help you forge a new identity without her and are less likely to bring her up

Boys can get lonely or alienated easily especially if their friends begin to mock them By making friends with his friends you show that you are part of his network and can be trusted Learn about their dynamic and find out how you would fit into their circle Whether itâs a book club microbrew club or movie club share an interest with him Invite others to join your club or keep it just the two of you Be careful not to make it seem like a date if youâre just beginning your friendshipYour club can meet once a week or once a month You basically want to share an activity together to strengthen your friendship bond but you donât want him to feel suffocated   Keep yourself occupied You donât want your life to revolve around your friendship with him Plus whether he shares your interest or not a new hobby will give you something to talk aboutTake a class Study something that youâve always been interested in so that you wonât become bored   Giving back to your community will give you a sense of wellbeing Itâs attractive to know that someone is selfless and looking to do some good He may also want to participate or be inspired to find his own volunteer opportunities Itâs fairly obvious that boys enjoy watching and playing sports You donât necessarily have to enjoy the same teams or sports as he does Enjoying your own team or sport would also be interesting to himGuys enjoy arguing over their favourite players or watching a game together Find something about the sport that you enjoy and focus on that You donât need to know every detail but you do need to actually enjoy the sport   Guys think that bodily noises are hilarious It may be fun for you to see how far you can push your own gross boundaries Donât be selfconscious just follow the standards set by the rest of the boysChallenge him to a belching contest and crack the same type of jokes that his male friends do The tired myth that girls dont have bodily functions or cant be funny or gross or clever is outdated and even harmful when it comes to relationships between men and womenShow him that youre not a strange weird being â youre a person just like him and you can be comfortable around each other and simply be yourselves   If you are of age this is a good opportunity to get to know him in a social setting Invite your friends and tell him to invite his Itâs a cheap and fun social gathering that is a far cry from a date Donât assume that guys and girls canât be just friends Itâs easy to think about gender stereotypes but view him as an individual with his own ideals about friendship You should be able to have different perspectives about things while still enjoying each otherâs company Studies have shown that guys do think about having a romantic relationship with their female friends if they were given a chance It may seem discouraging at first not to get the romantic attention but time may be on your sideA guy may not find a girl attractive at first but as time passes and he gets to know how smart funny and relatable she is that girl becomes more attractive Studies show that both girls and boys get teased by peers to turn a platonic friendship into a romantic relationship Donât feel obligated to do something youâre uncomfortable doing Be open with your friends and let them know that their teasing and pressure is hurtfulBoys may get mocked more by their friends for having female friends who arenât prospective girlfriends Friendship is not seen as masculine because it means that a boy must make himself vulnerable and confide in you   If he tells you about his latest crush or whatâs going on in his relationship be supportive You are a friend first and foremost Focus on your hope for a romantic relationship The worst that can happen is that you have a really close friend who you can happy for Having desire is fine but acting on your emotions may lead to trouble Make sure you have a firm grasp of how he feels before you put yourself out there or you may lose a good friend  A lot of TV shows and movies portray romance between friends as being an embarrassing mistake or an awkward situation If you donât make the transition correctly that very well might be the case Keep positive that your friendship will survive any fling If there are romantic feelings awkwardness will be inevitable unless one of you addresses how you feel about the other person You donât want anyone to get the wrong idea People may ask if youâre a couple when they see you alone together Limit the time you spend alone in public together Try to include other people when you canMovies are fine but eating together may be questionable and get people talking   Boys can be brutally honest so be prepared for blunt opinions and harsh comments For example if you ask a boy how you look you may not appreciate his true opinionDonât make this a one way street If he is brutally honest with you you may be brutally honest with him Put him at ease and let him know he can trust you like any of his male friends   Donât give in to temptation and give him a hug or rest your head on his shoulder If you get too touchyfeely you may give yourself away Donât blur the lines between boyfriend and friend Wait until youâre ready and sure of yourself or you may make him defensive Boys donât talk about the details of their romantic lives the way girls do so donât expect him to open up Donât talk about your own romantic relationship because if he does have feelings for you he will become confused Keep the conversations platonicIf you tell him about your romantic life he may think that you only see him as a friend If heâs seeing someone you may automatically judge her and badmouth her Donât deny him a chance at romance Donât make him choose between her or you   Avoid doting on him or flirting Let him know when heâs being a jerk or acting inappropriately Compliment him when heâs being a friend and scold him when heâs not If heâs going through a crisis in his life like a breakup or death in the family donât try to leverage his emotions into a romantic relationship He will feel taken advantage of and angryUnlike girls boys may be flattered to learn that a female friend likes them Girls may be upset and sad because trust has been lost Donât compare yourself to another girl that he likes or his current girlfriend This will lead to a lot of anxiety and frustration Donât act like a jealous girlfriend when you are only friendsDonât change who you are because you think that will win him over You canât make him fall in love with you Save your dignity and be yourself   Donât try to convince yourself of something that isnât there He may tell you that he loves you but only as a friend He may also say that he can see himself with you but only as a remote possibility and not at this second Save yourself from embarrassmentIf he already has ambiguous relationships than he may âwant to have his cake and eat it tooâ Be certain that he doesnât have another romantic interest or a serious girlfriend   Has he introduced you to all his friends and stopped talking about other girls around you Does he want to spend more alone time with you and plan out activities that resemble dates There are a number of signs that he may be giving off so pay attentionDoes he continually make it clear that heâs single and often give scenarios where the two of you are dating His body language may change and he may be more touchy feely than usual He may also start acting like your boyfriend or ask questions to probe about how youâre feeling about him What may seem obvious to you may seem vague and confusing to him You need to have a crystal clear idea of your friendship and whether romance is the next logical stepItâs okay if you discover that this isnât a good idea You donât want to lose a friendship by trying to force a relationship   If you donât want him to think of you as one of the boys or just a temporary fling let him know how you feel Be direct and completely honest Open communication is keyBe honest because any type of relationship that you want to preserve wonât last if the truth is ever found out Being honest with yourself can also help you manage expectations   You canât protect his feelings or your own Letting him know that you have a romantic life might get him to clue about his feelings for you Donât be vague and donât allow him to be vague about any intimate encountersYou need to be truthful about your current sexual activities because if you move from friendship to something physical you want to make sure that youâre safe from any STDs Laugh it off if he doesnât return your feelings The longer you hold in your feelings the harder it will be to continue being a true friend You donât want to begin a friendship or a romance with a lie If you plan to cross from friendship into something more anticipate the possibilities Depending on the dynamics of your friendship you may receive a variety of possible reactions He may feel flatteredembarrassed angry or amused If you put yourself out there and are initially rejected let time take its course If he is a true friend he will support you listen to what you have to say and will have your best interest in mind He wonât hurt you and if he does youâve dodged a bullet because he wasnât worth being your boyfriend or having you as a friend
When working with a horseâs hooves its important to move the horses foot into position in a way that doesnt surprise the horse or irritate it Make sure the horse is aware of your presence by gently patting it on the rump To get your horse to lift her foot run your hand down her leg Then squeeze the tendon above the ankle and lift the hoof The horse should shift its weight to its other three feetWhile you work hold the foot in place by tucking your hip against the horses hock the large joint on the hind leg and gaskin the muscle above the hock Use the inside of your knee to pull the foot out slightly and up between your legs so that the sole of the hoof faces up towards you Support the horses toe with one hand This position locks the horses foot in place making it difficult for the horse to kick or put its foot on the ground before youre done working Make sure that you reward your horse with praise for cooperating and waiting while you clean her hooves Saying âgood girlâ or âyesâ after she lifts each hoof for you will help to reinforce your horseâs good behavior  To remove a horseshoe first break straighten the nail clinches the bent tips of each nail that holds the shoe on with a clinch cutter and a hammer Work the blade of the clinch cutter under the clinch then hit it with a hammer to straighten the nail Then use a pair of metal pulloffs to loosen and remove the shoe Close the jaws of the pulloffs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion working towards the toe to loosen the shoe Repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled offSeveral alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches In a pinch you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards or if youre careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away   For your horses health and safety you dont want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot Before shoeing your horse use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt mud rocks manure etc from your horseâs foot Use downward strokes from heel to toe Follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanlinessTake care around the frog  the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof This part of the hoof is extrasensitive   Typically before a horse is shod the dark hard outer layer of each hoofs sole is removed to reveal the softer whiter material underneath in a process roughly equivalent to trimming a humans toenails Take care not to cut too deep or you risk hurting the horse or even rendering it temporarily lame  the same as if youd cut a persons nails too shortThis process is easiest if you keep your hoof knife razor sharp But use caution Its easy to accidentally slip and cut yourself while working   The hoof wall  the edge of the hoof  should extend about 3 inches 76Â cm to 3  34 inches from the hairline above the hoof itself If its any longer use a set of nippers essentially giant nail clippers to trim the edge of the hoof to a suitable lengthYou should see a ridge where the hoof wall extends beyond the sole Do not cut into the sole with the nippers or you may injure the horseWhen you trim the hoof with nippers be sure to keep the trimmed edges of the hoof uniformly straight and level so that theyll sit flush with the ground Trim from each side of the heel to the toe  The exception to this is in cases where a horses gait wears its hoof unevenly  in this case youll want to take slightly less hoof material off of the side that the horse favors Use caution when making this distinction and if unsure consult an experienced farrier     The very last thing that must be done to prepare the hoof for its shoe is to ensure the bottom of the hoof is smooth flat and level Use a rasp to gently file any uneven spots on the bottom of the hoof taking care as always not to wear the hoof too short or irritate the frog Then using your knife pare away slightly to bevel the sole away from the hoof wall Contact of the sole on the shoe can cause the horse discomfort As with human feet horse feet come in many different sizes and thus different horses will require differentsized shoes Before proceeding ensure that the shoes you have available are the correct size for your horses feet Note that a horses front and hind feet are differentlyshaped so you will need different shoes for eachmost horses have a size smaller in the back then the front but not always   If you have to choose between shoes that are slightly too big and shoes that are slightly too small choose the bigger shoes These can be bent shaped and ground down to a smaller size while toosmall shoes cant be made bigger Too long a shoe in front will cause the horse to step on the exposed heel of the shoe and pull it off   Often even if horse shoes are the correct size they will not fit a horses foot without adjustments Like human feet horse feet can be asymmetrical or uneven There are several ways to customshape horseshoes   If youre a knowledgeable metalworker you can heat the shoe until the steel can be bent to the size of the hoof Or you can cold shape the shoe on an anvil using a hammer and tongs Some farriers do neither opting instead to grind their shoes down until they fit with a rasp or grinding machine  Wellfitting horse shoes should align well with the edge of the hoof Keep in mind that it may take some time to get a shoe to the perfect size for your horse     Align the shoe so that it sits perfectly against the edge of the hoof then drive nails through the holes in the shoe to fix it to the horses foot When doing this care must be taken so as not to hurt or hobble the horse   Drive the nail through the hoof at an outward angle so that the nail tips go through the top of the hoof wall  Never drive nails into the sensitive inner portion of the hoof To make this easier use hoof nails that have a bevel on one side to guide the tip through the hoof wallWith these special nails the manufacturers stamp on the side of the nail head should face the center of the foot towards the frog  this ensures that the bevel is facing the right direction Some modern horseshoes use glue rather than nails to hold the shoe in placeIf youre worried about hurting your horse you may want to try this alternative Note that application methods for glueon shoes can vary  consult the manufacturer or an experienced farrier for more information   Once each nail has been driven use the claw end of your hammer to bend the tip of the nail over against the hoof wall Then twist off the tip or use a pair of nippers to bend and clip the tips off Try leave about 18 of the tip bent over the edge of the hole formed by the nail pointing towards the toe This ensures that the nail will hold the shoe in place without the sharp tip hurting you or the horse   Set a clinch block under the nail on the outer hoof wall then set the nail in the hoof or clinch it by hitting the nail head once again with the driving hammer This gives the nail a firm grip in the horses hoof ensuring the shoe stays in place You may use a sturdy metal tool like your nippers in place of the clinch block in a pinch   Another option is to use a special tool called a clincher With this tool all you need to do is align the jaws of the clincher over the nail tip and squeeze the handles   Finally give the outside of the hoof a onceover with a rasp smoothing out any uneven spots and giving the hoof a nice clean finish Pay special attention to the clinched nail tips which can also be filed smoothWhen finished you should be able to draw a cloth over the hoof wall without it catching   You may also notice that excess hoof material protrudes over the edge of the shoe If this is the case use a pair of nippers or pulloffs to remove it   Remember that the front and back hooves will require differentlyshaped shoes and that even the two front and back feet may not be perfectly symmetrical with each other
This aspect is essential Smell good effective hygiene is also a must Would you like to date someone with smelly armpits  Show good fashion sense yet stand out from the crowd For example your school uniform  wear a jacket or something that makes you stand out or even something like a badge to represent the music you listen to   Be sure to wear something you feel is comfortable If you know your crushs favorite smell or color be sure to wear that   Rely on the talents and attributes that you have naturally If youre a funny person use that to your advantage If youre a big sports fan and you know that your crush is as well all the better Share those common interests and use them to your advantage   Dont trick your crush into thinking youre something else when youre not If you do it will all change and he or she will see your true colors in time and may regret being with you   You need to know this person not only well enough so that heshe knows you exist but so that youre both comfortable in each others presence and can talk without feeling shy or embarrassed Dont rush this part of thingsââits better to take your time to cultivate the friendship than to rush and find that your crush isnt all you had hoped   Carry conversations with your crush every now and then Build these up to daily chats hellos and acknowledgments as much as possible You can have chats in person or even just on Facebook or other social media site Although your crush might like you too dont make it look like you are easygoing by replying immediately on online chatsââplay a little hard to get If your crush doesnt reply straight away then he or she might be talking to someone else who is more important at this point in time dont push it   Sharing common ground allows your crush to see that youre open to their ideas   Be sure not to insult their interests unless its in a teasing way dont be harsh   For example talk to them more mess around with them ask them vaguely about your crush etc You can try to find out what stuff your crush likes by way of music games TV sports school activities and so on   Be funny and happy Seem like a fun person to have around a lot   Say little things such as I like your new hairstyle I like your smile   They might be able to help you spend time around him or her They may even end up being the source of letting your crush know about your interest but at the very least let them be supportive and help you to find ways to spend more time with your crush   If you have been talking to your crush on FacebookTwitterin person just make sure that you dont tell your friends personal things that your crush talks to you about as he or she might not trust you and wont tell you stuff you want to know if this is found out Your crush may tell you things he or she is too embarrassed or shy to say to anyone else so guard that secrecy well   Things might get a bit messy between you and the other person if this is the case or you may just embarrass yourself big time   Equally check that your crush hasnt just had a break up as he or she might just want you to feel good by saying anything or might be stringing you along as a form of rebound revenge   When you feel comfortable remember to smile Gauge how the little flirting actions are going down If theyre being well received youre onto something If not slow down for a bit   Sometimes its better to just let your crush know you like them by telling them how you feel Just ask them out The worst they can most likely do is say no   If youre feeling shy or afraid remind yourself that if you dont ask you could be crushing on each other for the rest of your lives and itll never get sorted out   If he or she feels the same way youre off onto a new romantic adventure together   Deal with rejection as best you can Dont get crushed by a crush Sometimes it just isnt meant to be But stay positive and remember that there are plenty of fish in the sea and this match simply wasnt meant to be   Spend time together keep it cool and fun and realize that there is still a long way to go before you both really know where this is all headed Most of all aim to be good friends
Though telling your crush in person will make you look more confident and mature and saying it over the phone is sort of the worst way to do it if youre really shy about telling your crush how you feel then calling them and revealing your feelings is the next best bet Just say hello make them comfortable with a joke or casual comment say I wanted to tell you something and then reveal your feelings   Talking over the phone will make you feel less nervous because you wont see your crush face to face Still if youre nervous you can pace back and forth to get rid of some of that nervous energy If youre determined to tell your crush how you feel over the phone you can also practice by calling one of your friends and rehearsing what youd say first   Putting a cute note in your crushs locker textbook or backpack that tells them that you like them can be a nice way to tell them how you really feel Just write something like Hi Mark I just wanted to tell you that I like you Having your crush find the note at the right time can be a pleasant surprise  just make sure the note will be easy to find   If youre too nervous about saying I like you you can sidestep the situation by just asking your crush to hang out You can simply say you have extra tickets to a movie or a show and invite your crush along ask your crush if theyre hungry or want to grab a snack or coffee somewhere or ask if they want to go for a walk in the park Asking them to hang out solo will make your feelings pretty obvious so you can let your crush do more of the work when he figures it out   There are a few things you should avoid doing if you want to tell your crush that you like them and get the best results Here are some things you should avoid if you want to look confident and mature   Dont have your friends tell them how you feel If you want to look mature you have to do it yourself Dont do it over Facebook This will make you look like youre not serious or confident enough to have the conversation in person Dont be too eager when you tell your crush how you feel A simple I like you is far more effective and far less likely to scare them off than saying Ive been in love with you since the second grade
The period may be hours or days  If bees have been killed by something toxic or by something in the hive they will still be present   She will often still be present with a very reduced number of workers   With CCD this is unlikely to happen robber bees There may also be an unusual delay before wax moths invade the dead colony
This may sound silly but practice pursing your lips When you kiss you donât want them to be tightly pursed as though you were kissing your grandma On the other hand you dont want them to be too relaxed either   Ideally the first kiss will be soft but firm and passionate  Having a clean healthy mouth will make you more kissable Having visibly dirty teeth and bad breath will likely keep people from wanting to kiss you   Make sure you brush twice each day and floss at least once It is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss but for your own health as well Have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person Donât chew gum Although it will give you fresh breath having gum in your mouth during your first kiss can make it more difficult to enjoy the moment because you will have to worry about where the gum is in your mouth   If your lips are chapped and dry the kiss will be less comfortable for both of you Use a lip moisturizer such as vaseline regularly   If you are a girl avoid sticky lip glosses The person kissing you may find it weird and unenjoyable if your lips are very sticky and messy   This is probably the hardest part of any first kiss However if you want to kiss the person you are with look for signs that he or she wants to kiss you too Often a good time is if youâve been spending some time together alone having good conversation   Are they making a lot of eye contact Obviously this doesnât always mean they want to kiss you but if they make a lot of eye contact they at least find you interesting If they want to kiss you often they will be staring into your eyes or looking at your lipsWhat does their body language say If they have their arms folded across their chest then they probably donât want a kiss however if they have their body angled towards you are sitting or standing close to you with arms open then itâs likely a good betRemember that this moment could be planned or it could happen spontaneously Try to stay calm and go with the flow There are certain moments where it is more likely For example if it is the end of the night just before you both go home or if you are alone in a quiet moment   Although it is OK to take a quick peek every now and then it is usually better to keep your eyes closed If your partner realizes you have your eyes open heshe might feel uncomfortableIt will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed   When the kiss happens donât immediately try to stick your tongue in hisher mouth Instead start out by gently kissing with just your lips and if the kiss continues to that proceed slowly There is no need to rush when it comes to kissing   The worst thing you can do is to over think your first kissRemember that no matter what happens it is only one kiss and there will be many others Once you get the first kiss out of the way you can practice getting better at it   Enjoy the moment You only get one first kiss and you will likely remember it for your entire life Be present during the kiss Donât start thinking about how you canât wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary Simply enjoy it   Think about why you want to experience your first kiss Is it because you think you have to in order to be âcoolâ Or is it because you feel that you actually want to have this experience   There might be many reasons you want to experience your first kiss but in general it is a good idea to wait until you feel ready for it   Choose someone that you feel comfortable with and who wants to kiss you back Typically this will be your boyfriend or girlfriend but in some cases it may also be a close friend who wants to have the experience too Whoever it is it will be more enjoyable if it is someone you trust and feel comfortable with   Although the cutest girl or boy in school might be an obvious choice it doesnât mean they are the best choice You should choose someone you find attractive on the inside as much as the outside   Ask trusted friends about their first kiss and how they prepared themselves Ask them what advice they can give you If you feel comfortable doing so you can also discuss it with your parents   Dont be afraid to ask questions Almost every one can remember the nervousness and worries they had before their first kiss   Its likely that you will be worrying about all the things that could go wrong during your first kiss Ignore these thoughtsInstead let yourself think only positive thoughts   For example you can think about how youve taken good care of your lips and mouth making you very kissable You can think about how into you the person you will be kissing is and how romantic it will be   Although you will be nervous remember that you deserve to be kissed Believe that the kiss will go well and although it may not go perfectly it will all be OK   Remember that even if it doesnt go perfectly it is only the first of many   Nearly everyone feels nervous when kissing someone for the first time This is a biological reaction to our excitement and doesnât mean anything badRemember that this also goes for the person kissing you back It can sometimes be a comfort to remember the other person is also nervous If you do your best to act relaxed about the kiss it will help your partner relax too and you can both enjoy it   Often the first kiss will be everything you hoped it would be despite the fact that it didnt go perfectly However if things arent turning out so well dont get angry Instead pull away from your partner and smile It will help both of you relax and you can try again if you want to
The first thing you need to do is give the girl some space If you start knocking down her door and calling her every five minutes shell only pull further away from you The amount of space and time you give her depends on what happened when you tried to date her If you ended a serious relationship youll need to give her more space than you would if you had just dated a few times   Dont call her chat with her at parties or email her just to see how shes doing If you see her socially be polite and say hi but make it clear that youre not going to bother her Just dont give her too much space If you leave her alone for a few months that will give her plenty of time to find someone new  Not only should you give her some space but you should give yourself some space to reflect and think about what went wrong in the relationship Take the time to sit down and ask what you did to make her not want you were you too attentive too moody or too distant Whatever you did you have to make sure never to do it again if you want a moment of her day   Write down the things that went wrong Consider what you can do to improve this kind of behavior Dont date anyone else during the reflection period Focus on selfimprovement and working on not repeating the same mistakes Dont pursue her until youve figured out what went wrong and know how to change it   Though you should avoid getting busy in the bedroom while youre trying to win your girl back you should try to live a busy and active life so you can work on being independent and pursuing your interests If youre just sitting around waiting for enough time to pass to start trying to hang out with her again shell know   Continue pursuing your hobbies and interests Dont stop doing all of the things you love because your heart is aching Spend time with your friends Theyll cheer you up and lend you a fresh perspective Work out Your selfesteem will improve if you exercise a few times a week and all the better if she sees you out running   Once youve given her some space and have worked on selfimprovement shell be much closer to wanting you But now you have to put all the pieces together and let her see what an amazing guy you are and how much fun it is to be around you Be strategic Without looking like a stalker make sure youre hanging out in some of the same places so she can see what a blast it is to be around you   Laugh it up If she sees you try to laugh with your friends as much as you can without being too obvious about it Be animated If shes around be very animated and interested in the conversations youre having showing that youre a passionate guy who loves to talk to his friends Dont ignore her when she sees you Give her a small wave and go back to the great conversation you were having Dance Thats right Chances are she was mad that you didnt dance with her more Let her see you getting down on the dance floor and having a great time Let her see you being your best self There was obviously something she liked about you so use your assets to your advantage   This is an optional move because it depends on the situation If your relationship ended because she was so jealous that you were always hanging around with other girls then you shouldnt make her jealous or shell just be reminded of the reason why things didnt work out between you But if your relationship ended because she thought you were just too into her or that she was bored by you then making her jealous is a great move Heres how to do it   If youre on speaking terms casually mention other girls You can mention one girl a few times leading her to wonder Who is this girl Or you can just talk about a group of girls mentioning that you were at a party that was filled with mostly girls but that you were okay with that Let her see you with other girls Chat with her for a few minutes before moving on to flirt with another girl thats nearby Make sure youre close enough for her to watch it happen Dont overdo it If she hears you talking about other girls and sees you flirting with others she may want you even more but if youre all over every girl at every party you may look desperate or sleazy   If you cant think of what went wrong in the relationship because you smothered her with love then chances are that this was exactly what went wrong She must have felt that your love and relationship was too easy so you should try to make it more of a challengeBe aloof You should still give her some attention but act busy or distracted and like youre not giving all your attention to her for once This will confuse her and will make her want you more Be sparing with the compliments If you did nothing but compliment her 247 when you were together give her just one compliment to show that youre not obsessing over her Let her come to you She was probably used to having you come up to her touch her and talk to her all the time now its time for some role reversal If youre at a party let her approach you instead of stopping everything youre doing to head her way   If you broke up because she felt that you didnt give her enough affection or time or that you spent too much time flirting with other women its time to do the exact opposite and to make yourself available to her and have no other women on your radar   Show her that your schedule is free and that youre up for hanging out whenever Shell no longer have to hang out with you during the one hour youre free Dont make her jealous In your case you should stay away from the other ladies as much as possible to show that you only have eyes for her Take the time to listen If she thought you didnt care about her feelings before maintain eye contact and let her talk without interrupting You can mention something she said in the conversation a day later to show that you really do hang on to her every word Compliment her If you never complimented her before shell see that you changed   If you really want her back you have to be the man and apologize for what went wrong If she was hurt by you shell want to stay away from you for fear of getting hurt again So man up and tell her you made a mistake   Make sure to do this in person It wont do if you just send her a text message or an email it has to be in person otherwise she will see that you are not very serious about this apology and so she wont take it seriously either So own up and go apologise for what you did to her Be sincere Maintain eye contact when you talk to her and keep a calm even tone She wont believe you if it sounds like youre apologizing just because its what you should do Be specific Dont just say Im sorry for everything Say Im sorry I didnt listen to you when you really wanted to talk I should have been much more attentive She will appreciate this and it will make you seem more selfaware Dont be disappointed if she doesnt accept your apology right away If she doesnt accept it shes probably still working through what happened but still appreciates your effort Just say You cant blame me for trying instead of arguing her into accepting your apology   She should be able to see how much youve changed without you having to say it yourself or to convince her that youre completely different Face it  many girls are more mature than their male counterparts so wow her with your ability to be rational and mature   Dont be moody Act evenkeeled and calm and shell be impressed Be confident Show her that youre happy who you are and what you do and shell be happier with who you are too Be responsible Show her that you can manage your finances hold down a good job and take care of your dog at the same time Dont be jealous Dont ask her about that guy shes been talking to this will only encourage her to talk to him more and will make you look insecure for caring   Once she wants you a bit more and can see that youre a different person its time to stop playing games and to tell her how you really feel How else can you get the ball rolling If it ended badly shes not going to ask you to pick things up again so you need to get your act together and open up   Tell her at the right place and time Pick a time when shes not too busy and you can be alone ideally at night or in a semisecluded location Maintain eye contact when you tell her No looking around no checking your phone No more Mr Tough Guy Its time to be open and honest and to share your true feelings First acknowledge what went wrong and apologize for it again if you havent already Then tell her how much youve changed and how much youd love to give it another try Say I cant believe what an idiot Ive been You were the best thing that ever happened to me and I really screwed it up Let me make it up to you Dont sound like youre begging and pleading instead make it sound like barely a question at all Let her know that youre going to try again and hopefully youll get the answer you were looking for   If she agrees to go out with you you better do it right this time Youre lucky enough to be getting a second chance and third chances are hard to come by Make the most of your time together and make sure to treat her right Heres what to do  Turn up the romance factor Bring her flowers and take her to a romantic restaurant Now you shouldnt overdo it to the point that she feels uncomfortable Just add a little bit of the romance that was probably missing before       Compliment her Let her know she looks nice when you pick her up and compliment her throughout the date       Let her know how much youve missed her Find one or two moments during the date when you tell her how glad you are to have her in your life       In the end be yourself You can become a better listener a more attentive person or just learn to understand her needs but in the end youre still you and you should make sure she likes who you really are Dont try so hard to show that youve changed that theres nothing left of the old you         If the date went well and if there are more dates to follow you need to make sure the relationship doesnt end for the same reason if you really want to stay with this girl If shes a keeper you must remind yourself that you have to continue making her feel special   Remind yourself what happened the last time and vow not to do it again Look at it as starting fresh You dont have to rehash the old relationship but work on building something completely new and much better Relax Just enjoy being with the girl instead of worrying about not screwing up again all the time
If the girl teases you then its another surefire sign that she has a crush on you Teasing is just one form of flirting and its her way of letting you know she has a crush on you while being playful If she teases you then shell make fun of your clothes playfully push or shove you or even make fun of your hair or new shoes Dont be offended  this is just her way to let you know that shes paying attention to you   See if she teases all of the guys or just you If she teases everyone then she may just be a playful person But if its just you then youre special to her   If the girl is always giving you complements then theres a good chance she has a crush on you If she tells you she likes your new shoes that she liked your history presentation or that you did great in the baseball game though all you did was strike out then yeah she probably has a crush on you If a girl has a crush on you shell like every little thing you do and she may not be afraid to tell you about it   See if shes the type of girl who is just really nice and gives everyone compliments or if she only says flattering things to you Who knows  maybe shes just really really nice But probably not If she compliments a new shirt or a new haircut that means she notices when your wardrobe or looks change which already is a strong sign that she has a crush on you   If a girl has a crush on you then shell try to talk to you as much as she can  unless shes really shy If you dont have many mutual friends or other reasons to be around each other she may come up and ask you an obvious question like something about the math homework that she could have easily asked another friend She may even call or text you to ask an obvious question hoping it could lead to more conversation   If she likes you she may even try to talk to you about something she know that you love like a sport or favorite TV show She could come up to you just to ask if you saw last nights game or to ask what you thought about the season finale of your favorite show She could share your interests too of course but she could also be using them as an excuse to talk to you   The girl may think shes being subtle when she asks if you like anyone or when she asks you if youre going out with any girls this weekend or asks if you have a crush on a specific girl but youll be able to see right through her If shes asking if you have a crush on anyone shes really asking Do you like me   Theres only one other option  she could be asking if you like anyone because one of her friends like you and shes acting as a gobetween If you tell her you dont like anyone and she says something like How can you not like anyone You must like someone Then she really wants you to tell her that you like her Even the fact that she takes any interest in your love life shows that she has romantic feelings for you   Does the girl subtly try to put down the other girls you hang out with Does she mention that any girls youve dated in the past arent good enough for you If so then what shes really saying is that she thinks shes the one for you If she puts down any girls you hang out with or even any girls she just sees you talking to in the halls then shes just jealous that she doesnt have all of your attention   Its okay for her to be jealous before you start dating  just make sure it isnt a problem if she does end up being your girlfriend   She may think shes just dropping a hint but if she often says things like It would be cool to have a boyfriend or being single is so not fun or I wish I had a guy to go to the movies with then shes basically asking you to be her boyfriend If shes always making subtle comments about how much she wants to date someone that person is you   Theres only one other option  that she wants to date one of your friends But if she never asks about any of your friends then chances are that she has her eye on you   If all she says about other guys is that this or that guy isnt good enough or that he isnt nearly as great as you then shes basically saying that she has a crush on you She may even say that she wished this or that guy possessed a certain quality  one that you have   If she says she wishes that a guy she went on a date with had a better sense of humor and she always praises your sense of humor then shes basically telling you that she wants to date you If shes always comparing you favorably to other guys then shes letting you know that she likes you more than any other guy around   If shes always texting you or calling you then chances are that she has a crush on you If she sends you a lot of cute smiley face emoticons or calls you just to say hi or for a dumb excuse like asking for the homework for a class that she could get from anyone then shes just looking for reasons to talk to you   If she texts you a smiley face or just a word like hehe then shes flirting with you
Walk over the entire pasture and check for anything that could harm your horse Such things to watch out for would be glassragwort barbed wire splintered wood large or even small pieces of metal and holes These can all cause serious harm or even death to your animal if not removed so take careful note  Do not pick up or fill in anything in the first runthrough of the pasture Make a map of the pasture and mark where there are problem areas that have any of the aforementioned problems This will help you later when you are doing the final runthrough as well as help you notice any pattern in the locations of debris If you see broken glass or pieces of manmade materials in a certain area more than once make a mark on the map and check the surrounding area extra carefully just in case something was broken or dumped around that area and spread   With a large plastic garbage bag thick rubber gloves and a shovel address any problem areas in the pasture If you already have a horse living in the pasture make note of if they are afraid of plastic bags some horses are If this is the case steer clear of the horse while doing this or place the horse in another pasture entirely   Fill in the holes This will take a while of course but is one of the most important parts to ensuring the safety of your horses Take dirt from an area where there is some extra such as from the embankment of the pond and where you can expect the dirt to fill in relatively soon Fill in any holes large enough for you to stick your fist into Take care if you cannot see the bottom of the hole it very well may be a snake or gopher hole If you are not prepared to deal with such animals make a red mark on the map where that hole is and come back later when you are prepared to do battle For all other holes fill in liberally tamp the dirt down to make sure its packed tightly and come back in a week to make sure that the dirt hasnt settled into the hole causing another hole Dispose of the garbage Recycle if at all possible Otherwise itll end up being trash in someone elses pasture or just dumped into the ground and thats not much good in the long run is it Eradicate any weeds Not only do weeds reduce the feeding value of your pasture but some plants can make horses sick so find out which species are common in your area Learn to identify them so that if you see them in the pasture you can remove them with a shovel root and all Keep an eye on those spots for regrowth and use herbicides if necessary     Walk the length of the fencing you are using for the pasture and make sure it is intact If you have fencing that breaks often you may want to replace the entire fence Barbed wire is not a good idea for horses they can easily hurt themselves by various means with barbed wire and to boot many rescue agencies dont allow you to adopt a horse from them if you have barbed wire  Wooden fences are a safe bet but break often if you dont maintain them well Electrical fencing may sound like a good idea but only in moderation Using one cord of electrical fence on the top of a wooden fence is normally a relatively safe idea if you have a horse that jumps the fence a lot but for the sake of the horse and your electrical bill turn it down as low as possible   Examine all entrances and exits to the pasture These are normally the weak points in fencing since gating may all be dependent upon one halfinch thick rope and thats it If your gating situation is similar seriously consider purchasing a metal gate that has an actual lock on it Even if your horses are quite tame and docile the sweetest horse can still take any chance to escape Its quite a hassle to round them up again In addition to keeping the horses in a strong gate is vital to keeping other things out of the pasture While a determined person probably could just jump the fence a large animal is easily stopped by maintaining the gating and fencing situation Talk to your neighbors if you share a fence with them Tell them that you are preparing to bring in a new horse and need to be sure that they are not planning on changing anything about the fencing if the current fence is acceptable If the current fencing is not acceptable tell them before changing anything about the fence as they may have a reason for leaving the fence as it is If that is the case you may have to build a second fence on your side of the pasture This cuts off your land earlier but solves any neighbor problems you may be having and helps control any unruly animals they may have that could pose a danger to your horses   Now that it is clean take this chance to make sure the pasture is actually habitable by horses    Make sure the food supply is adequate Are your horses going to eat purely grass from the pasture and survive off of that If so see the Tips below Or are you planning on feeding them hay and horse feed Make sure that the feeding area is near water and if you have multiple horses set up multiple feeding areas broken off from one another Very often one horse dominates over the other and will steal the weaker horses food If they are just going to graze for food verify that there is enough grass If you live in a dry arid climate there may very well not be enough grass growing to feed your horses Buying bales of hay in the winter is a very good idea you can simply place a bale out in the pasture and let the horses eat off of it when they wish to Ensure adequate water is available for your horses This is absolutely crucial A larger paddock may have a dam in it or it may have a river running through it In many horse paddocks you may have to ferry water to a water trough or tub Simply take a couple of old wash tubs and place them out in the pasture Fill with water whenever possible Take another tub and place it where you can easily get to it and keep it supplied with water at all times Ensure that the troughs are clean and away from over hanging branches as falling leaves will cause the water to become unsanitary faster Have the trough close to a fence so as it wont become a hazard to running horses and so you are able to remove the trough if portable in a case of emergency or situation If you have two adjoining paddocks an old bathtub may be useful as you are able to have it in both paddocks by cutting a hole in the fence and having half of the bathtub on each side Make sure that the tub is clean and free of cracks and sharp edges A plug is essential to prevent the water from draining out You can pick up old bath tubs from recycle plants or you can inquire at your local bathtub specialist     Bring your horses in during daylight hours preferably 3 or more hours prior to the sun setting This way your horses can learn about their new surroundings and there will be a less of a chance of finding an injured horse in the morning Watch them carefully for a couple of days and inspect any wounds that they may develop If any wounds do develop and you have reason to suspect that it had something to do with the pasture that could have been avoided eg a long gash along the side indicating barbed wire somewhere in the field remove the horses and go back to step one You want the horses to be as safe and as happy as possible  Checking the fence at least once every 2 or 3 days is also a good idea If you have time do a quick check of the pasture and fence once a day

Body language can be the big tell when it comes to discerning if that guy fancies you enough to date you Interestingly body language experts believe that while females have around 52 body language tells to show a guy that theyre interested guys show around only 10If you subscribe to this theory this should make your guessing a little easier All the same you still need to know what to look for as well as being sure that youre not mistaking innocent gestures for calls of loveââthe latter mistake could prove embarrassing Some of the signs of body language to watch for include   He looks at you a lot His eyebrow may even lift as he watches you the eyebrow flash that lasts a fifth of a second He might not even be really conscious he is watching you as much as he is Notice how much he looks at your face and makes eye contact He leans towards you a lot Personal space invasion is a sign of major interest Check the direction of his hands feet legs toes etc If theyre pointed toward you its a subconscious indicator of his interest in you He starts grooming himself He pulls at his tie to straighten it or he readjusts the fit of his sweater Perhaps he runs his hands through his hair in attempt to tidy it or he reaches down to tie his shoelaces Doing this repeatedly is similar to the actions of a male bird preening up his feathers for a display Check out how hes sitting If you see rather manly gestures such as sitting with open legs or placing his hands on his hips hes trying to impress If he likes you you may see that he rarely turns his back to you often leans towards you and also looks at you a lot If he slouches his shoulders when near you hes romantic and cares about what you have to say If he points his shoulders and pelvis towards you while sitting he is definitely feeling something for you  As already noted a guy who is interested in you will look at you a lot even if covertly He may try to catch your eye or if hes shy he may suddenly turn his head away if you catch him checking you out To test his interest scan his face for four seconds then look away dont look any longer or it becomes awkward Then look backââif he maintains or increases eye contact with you hes interested If his eyes wander to your mouth hes definitely interested If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else or if he looks away quickly then there is something there On the other hand if he breaks eye contact with you and starts looking around the room hes not interested in you   A gaze that has him looking left then sweeping over your face then looking right is a sign hes very attracted to youBe careful not to confuse a shy guys darting retreat from eye contact with a guy who is clearly disinterested A shy guy who is interested will continue to steal glances at you Be patient If you dont like the guy it can be uncomfortable to maintain eye contact break it off quickly and scan the room yourself as if looking for someone else When hes around you and he says or does something funny and everyone around laughs his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed tooââthis means hes keen to make a good impression on you His pupils may dilate if he likes you but this is quite hard to pick up on and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes If youre around him for a long time it could be easier to pick up on gradually   If he likes you and hes nervous or anticipating the chance to get closer to you hell probably start talking about himself Many times guys feel the need to prove themselves especially if you talk about another guy in his company   Gauge his interest in what you have to say It really doesnt matter what you say its how you say it that can tell you a lot about his level of interest So try this Lean in and whisper with your shoulder barely touching his and say something softly To heighten the impact steady yourself gently by brushing your arm across his back If he moves his head closer toward you and either touches you back or maintains eye contact hes interested in you If he isnt interested hell probably step back or be very unresponsive A really disinterested guy might even try to shoo you out of his personal space   Touch is an important sign of interest in a developing relationship and you can assess interest both by observing how he touches you and how he reacts to you touching him If hes keen on you he might put his hand on yours when he laughs he might gently brush his leg against yours but wont move it away again or he may hug you for small things such as greeting you expressing emotions when telling a story or just because you look like you need a hug On the other hand consider touching him to see what happensââa gentle brush of your hand against his neck a hold of his forearm with your hand or running your fingers across his hand after joking with him about something Hes interested in you if he responds to it and doesnt flinch away or if he moves his hand to stay on yours or on your arm or leg On the other hand if he tenses up or moves his hand away hes not interested   If he is a shy guy he may jump a little because he wasnt prepared for you to touch him That doesnt necessarily mean that he doesnt like you watch his actions carefully afterwards Obviously playboy guys bad boys might be very keen to spread their touching gestures around be sure that he has more substance than this by observing how he interacts with other women in your group See if he uses any of the tricks in How to touch a girl and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else   If hes really interested in you he may start to behave protectively toward you or in a gentlemanly fashion at least to the extent that he interprets his behavior as such Look for signs like shifting his chair closer to yours putting his arm around the back of your chair leaving his jacket on the back of your chair or even going so far as to place the jacket around you to ward off your complaints of being cold   Be aware that some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention It gives him a chance to see your reaction and helps him know if you really do like him or not Yes its an odd sort of logic especially since you might end up so offended or confused that you just give up on him However you can usually spot a getyourattention flirt if in the middle of his flirting scenario he keeps taking the chance to look at you seeking out your response You can also try a quick trip to the bathroom and find yourself a sneaky observation point to check out how the flirting is proceeding If he stops the moment youve left its you hes serious about not her Alternatively ask a friend to do some observing for you while youre away   For example if you like a certain genre of music that he doesnt know as well he may ask you to suggest bands or artists for him to listen to Or he may have gone to the trouble of finding out that a favorite band of yours is playing next weekend and mention to this with or without a request to go and listen together And if you introduce him to a TV show that he didnt really know about and that becomes his new favorite thing that can potentially be a sign that he likes you especially if he goes out of his way to catch up with you to discuss the shows unfolding plot   Signs of nervous laughter sweaty palms deep breaths fidgeting or possibly even looking away quickly when you notice he is watching you can all be signs of an attraction towards you If he is nervous about making an impression on you it means hes trying hard and you are probably very close to being able to start making moves   If they know hes interested in you they might tease him subtly when youre around hint to you that he likes you or even try to find out if you like him Study their reactions to your presenceââdo they smile Do they turn to him Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you dont   Be careful if a friend of his makes suggestions that a guy likes you but all of the other indications tell you otherwise Sometimes friends have reasons of their own for ensuring that any chances of you getting together are ruined including catapulting you into making a fool of yourself   Mirroring each others actions is a sign of mutual like and generally its subconscious If you notice that he has been copying your gestures frequently there is a high probability that he fancies you You can test this by mirroring his actions too for example touch your hair when he touches his brush your face when he brushes his sit the way he is sitting etc The subconscious signals will be screaming I like you too   Following you can be another sign for example if you buy lunch and sit at a table and he edges as near to or even on the same table as you he is probably trying to get closer to you Just be sure youre not confusing this action with there being a lack of space to sit anywhere else   If a guy teases you in a friendly and fun manner it could indicate his interest especially if hes young Provided this isnt his modus operandi with every girl he flirts with its a sign that hes singled you out for attention and is trying to use his wit to charm you in that awkward way of using humor to cover up true intentions Of course if he says something unkind or unfortunate dont feel you have to excuse itââpoint it out if he offends you its best he knows now that you wont take nonsense than to discover it later   Some guys make fun of their crushes in a slightly mean way If this goes too far he may need a reminder to act more mature   A guy may gently hit or punch you on the arm as a covert manly way of getting to touch you without making it too obvious what his intention is If he finds that you dont pull away too much when he does this he might find the courage to proceed to more gentle ways of touching you Of course this doesnt mean you need to sit there in pain if he actually hurts youââbe assertive enough to point out that it hurt You can salve his pride by saying something about not minding him touching you but to please watch out for your sensitive bony bits And if youre the kind of girl who finds the play punching a bit of fun give him a playful knock right back   Play punching can send mixed signals It could mean I treat you like one of the boys and signal friendzone antics only Check out whether he does this to other girls in your mutual group Moreover if he continues to think that play punching you is a fun way to hang out you might be dealing with someone who is never going to get past this immature display of affection dont let it go on indefinitely If you dont like it say so immediately You are entitled to ask someone not to harm you even if the gesture is well intentioned   If you do your hair or makeup differently one day and the guy notices thats a very good sign that he likes you Most guys wont notice or if they do they wont be bothered to say anything unless theyre totally into you Anything like You look nice today I like that shirt or even Did you do your hair differently today It looks nice are all indicators that he could be interested in you   Note If this guy is a good friend of yours compliments wont necessarily be indicators of romantic interest It could just be him being a truly good friend Not all guys are this straightforward about compliments so dont be worried if he doesnt compliment you   For example some of your dads aftershave rubbed off on you when you hugged him Your crush may say is that aftershave on you Noticing this can indicate that he thinks the scent comes from another guy and not your dad revealing some vulnerability about losing you out to someone else This could also apply to having carrying or wearing things that he might think belong to another guy   After all when online there are many things competing for his time like games connecting with mates and checking out sites that might not be so interesting to youâ Of course he could also just be talkative friendly or even bored so dont assume hes into you just for chattingââthis should be treated as one extra indicator along with some of the others outlined above   If he puts an x sign on the end of everything he says to you dont assume it means he likes you It could just mean that he perceives you both as good friends or that hes just used to ending his chats that way If he says I know something you dont know then this could mean that he likes you and is playing a little guessing game Or it could just mean hes doing the usual social media thing of spreading information for fun like the discovery of a new planet or finding the cure to cancer etc Use the context to judge the import of any such online personal game playing   If he suddenly seems to be in certain places at certain times of the day where you wouldnt necessarily expect to see him it may be that hes taken to deliberately finding opportunities to bump into you If it happens a lot in a short space of time its probably no coincidence but a concerted effort to catch up with you as much as possible   If he shows genuine interest in you for example he smiles at you a lot whenever the two of you pass each other or he goes out of his way to say hello to you be friendly and polite back If youve already decided that hes someone youd like to date dont let it go too long before facilitating an opportunity for the two of you to get together to talk in a quiet place On the other hand if hes not your type or youve changed your mind about flirting any further be honest and let him know that youre flattered but youre not available

should try and make friends with his friends and work up from there Get close to him so that he starts noticing you right away If you really like him than make sure he really notices you   Laugh a lot

girlfriend is one who is not always romantic but one that is a friend   This does not mean betraying or belittling your own beliefs Yours are every bit as important as his Discuss them when you can   Listen to what he has to say Always hear him out Take the opportunity to learn new facts about him Respect what he says but form your own opinions about them Have conversations with him Attraction often starts when we have a great emotional connection with someone by really bonding with him Try to have interesting funny playful conversations with him to establish that bond It doesnt matter what you talk about The important thing is that you have meaningful interaction Ask him about his background â his parents his childhood his siblings These things are personal so be respectful Offer to share your own background to give him a better idea of who you are Ask him about his goals â what he always dreamed about being what hes interested in what makes him happy You can learn a lot about a person from his goals Start thinking about your own goals so that you can share them with him     No matter how much you trust your friends if they ever become mad at you they could go behind your back and tell him something you said about him   Stick up for him if he gets teased or involved in a fight Dont let him wonder whether or not youre his friend â make it absolutely clear Dont gossip about him Gossip has a way of spreading like wildfire You dont want juicy stuff getting back to him quite yet Shut down the gossip   Small talk is fine in the beginning you dont want to rush into it or else it will seem weird But smile be nice and talk with his friends Hell want you to get along with them   You might have to be the one who asks him but if he agrees it wont matter that youre the one asking him   At first hang out with a group of people Go to the beach or lake together hang out at the skate park go to a football game as a group Here are some other options of teenfriendly things you can do Go to an amusement park rollercoasters minigolf arcade games etc Go to the movies Go to the state fair Hang out after school Sometimes the best times are when youre not doing anything just hanging out     When the two of you are comfortable it might be okay to drop a few hints that you are interested in becoming more than an ordinary friend Notes work Texts work but a handwritten note is best that way hell have a keepsake from you   Ask him to hold your backpack or carry your books to the next class See what he does Ask him to a dance SadieHawkins dance if you have one would be the perfect opportunity The girl is supposed to ask the guy Flirt with him There are a bunch of ways to flirt with him Flirt with your eyes Lock his eyes with yours and smile at him sweetly Hold his eyes a little longer than normal Flirt with touch Gently touch his shoulder with your hand when you talk with him Flirt with words Tell him that hes good at sports or compliment him on his new haircut Hell be thrilled that you noticed Hold his hand This should make it really clear to him you are interested Hug him more tightly than a friend hug and maybe just a little more often A small gift One of those small Valentines Day hearts that reads I LIKE YOU is perfect     Some guys your own age might not get the hint Girls do usually reach puberty earlier than guys so girls usually reach that level of emotional maturity earlier as well   Be casual about it Hey I realized I didnt have your phone number Establishing a friendship outside of school or extracurriculars will be important   Wait for him to call you You dont want to come on too strong guys dont like talking on the phone as much as girls Text him kind of regularly just for simple conversation Dont make it pointless however because guys dont like smalltalk Flirt with him with texts Facebook IM and emails will also work Say something like I didnt know youd singlehandedly destroy the football team on Friday Nice work   Guys will often let you know if hes interested in you or not without putting any words to it There will be a part of you that will be able to tell by instinct   Be on the lookout for signs that hes nervous around you It could mean he likes you Does he Sweat or blush when he talks to you It could be his body saying that hes into you Look at you and then look away when you catch him staring He cant get enough of your looks and hes daydreaming Constantly hang around you but not with you It could be we wants to look at and be around you but doesnt want you to know     If hes hugging or holding hands with you then youre golden He likes you But here are some other signs in case youre not completely sure   Do his pupils dilate when he looks at you Sometimes his eyes will change color slightly Does he touch you offer to give you piggybacks or bump into you randomly He could want to get any excuse to touch you because he likes you Gulp loudly or stumble around with his words His heart is pumping hard and hes worried about messing up Dont trust too many other minutebyminute changes to his anatomy Some of those changes even the more obvious ones are completely random in very young men for several years   Remember its better to have tried and failed than to never try in the first place Wait for the right moment Youll pretty much know when the time comes   If you are ready to ask him out dont say it in front of a group or something or he might say no Be calm cool and collected while youre asking him Make eye contact with him and remember to smile Be confident Its really hard to ask him but youre up for the challenge arent you Ask him if he wants to go to the movies or grab a bite to eat You dont have to call it a date for it to be a date   Yes it will feel bad for a time No it wont last forever Remind yourself of all that you have to offer There will be plenty of other guys   If he says no just smile and walk away with your emotions covered up Try not to be awkward around him or mean to him Staying classy might cause him to reconsider   For instance kiss him when he says yes to being your boyfriend but then for the first week or so settle with hugging and holding hands If he wants to kiss you go ahead   If he kisses you dont make it a passionate kiss the first time You want him to be interested in kissing you again so only give him a little taste the first time Dont let him pressure you into anything Relationships are about mutual respect not one person getting something the other isnt comfortable with   At the beginning of a relationship some people think its a brilliant idea to make a pact that theyll still be friends when we breakup Dont do this   This gives the guy a sense of security so generally he wont be heartbroken to lose you Plus its weird to talk about breakups in the beginning How do you know what youll be feeling when you break up You just dont know Talk about happier things Instead of talking about the relationship just be in the relationship This will help the guy out Sometimes its better and easier to act instead of talk   Guys need some space Just because hes hanging out with his friends doesnt mean he doesnt like you or that he likes someone else   Let him see his friends Dont become clingy Yes spend a substantial time together in the afternoon or weekends but let him see his friends at school If he never makes time for you however thats a warning sign Make sure that he gives you enough time He should want to be with you if hes in a relationship with you you might just have to tell him that you need him to pay more attention to you Dont get upset every time he talks to another girl Guys are allowed to talk to other girls just not flirt or go over the line with them Trust him until he gives you a reason not to   Dont obsessively talk with him all night on social networks or MSN If you dont talk to him every second it will make him want to talk to you even more   Spend most of your time talking in person or on the phone Its okay to call him every other or every third night You dont want an awkward internetrelationship where you dont feel comfortable with one another in person Its okay to send him sweet messages every once in a while Make them surprises If you do it irregularly hell be even more excited Dont always expect a response   Dont let him treat you like a doormat Youre a living breathing human being and you deserve respect   Dont let him boss you around or tell you what to do Stand up for yourself when you need to Love yourself first If you cant love yourself its hard to love him Youll find a lot of things you like and dislike about yourself in a relationship Theyre like mirrors Change the things about yourself that you dislike and guard the things about yourself that you likeRelationships are about two people If youre doing all the work and he just sits back and enjoys it youre not doing yourself any favors   Make sure he shows you affection too You deserve respect and consideration Make sure he knows this   Breakups happen all the time theres still a chance that you could get back together or if theres not there are plenty of other guys out there   Theres no need to unfriend him on Facebook or MSN Just unsubscribe from him and dont talk to him Be friendly but distant You want to be nice to him but you dont want him to get any ideas You want him to feel stupid that you ever broke up in the first place Hold your head high Youre growing into a beautiful young lady Be confident about who you are and people will appreciate you

Monkeys are in the order of primates which is divided into families of New World primates smaller treedwelling monkeys from South America and families of Old World primates larger ground and treedwelling monkeys from Asia and Africa Each type of monkey has unique characteristics that affect how they fare as pets Before you decide which type to get conduct a lot of research on its characteristics Read books talk to owners and get to know as many monkeys as you can in person   Squirrel monkeys capuchins spiders and macaques are all types of monkeys people keep as pets Some are more social while others can be on the nervous side These monkeys all have the same general care requirements though larger monkeys will need more space than the smaller ones Apes such a chimpanzees gibbons and orangutans are not monkeys and should not be kept as pets They are much stronger than humans and can become quite dangerous in a domestic situation  Bringing a monkey into your home is almost as big a commitment as deciding to have a child Monkeys require attention all day every day and unlike cats and dogs they cannot be left at home for extended periods of time Once your monkey bonds with you he will want to follow you wherever you go and if you try to leave him by himself he will become bored depressed and aggressive Monkeys can live for 20 to 40 years so bringing one home is a commitment to spend a significant portion of your life providing for your monkeys needs Before you decide to get a pet monkey ponder the following facts about life with a monkey   The monkey may become aggressive When monkeys are babies they are dependent and sweet like baby humans But when they reach sexual maturity which happens around age 3 or 4 their behavior can become unpredictable Monkeys are wild animals and unlike cats and dogs they have not been socialized to live with humans over thousands of years Even a monkey who has bonded with a human as a baby may unpredictably bite and attack his owner or become quite difficult to live with as an adult Youll have to say goodbye to your free time Monkeys cannot be left to their own devices They need constant attention and care or else they can end up hurting themselves or someone else And since they tend to bond with just one person its difficult to find a good monkeysitter when you need some time to yourself Your monkey may prevent you from having relationships you want Monkeys tend to bond with just a few people Having a monkey might prevent you from getting intimately involved with potential partners to whom the monkey has a negative reaction Monkeys dont get along well with children so having a monkey could keep you from starting a family All that said if you are one of the unique people with the temperament and discipline it takes to devote your life to the safety and care of your monkey you may be rewarded with an amazing experience Monkeys are intelligent endlessly entertaining and sometimes incredibly affectionate Many people who share their lives with monkeys embrace the challenges and wouldnt trade their time with their beloved pets for anything   It is illegal to have a pet monkey in many states and more states will probably pass laws against the practice in the future For this reason its difficult to move to a new state or travel across state lines when you own a monkey Its illegal to bring a monkey into the US so that means you cant travel abroad with your monkey and then try to bring him home   Some states allow monkeys to be kept as pets but have strict regulations as to the conditions under which the monkeys should be contained Regulations regarding pet monkeys are different in countries outside the US Look into the laws in your jurisdiction to find out whether there are any restrictions on which animals you can keep as pets   When youve decided that its time to get a monkey do research in your area to find a dealer or breeder with an established reputation as someone who can be trusted They should have a USDA permit number which is required of all breeders in the United States   Ask the dealer or breeder for the contact information of someone else who has bought a monkey from them That way you can check into the monkeys health and behaviorExpect to pay upwards of 1000 for a monkey of any species A baby squirrel monkey can cost over 8000 Older monkeys are less expensive but much more difficult to handle once you bring them home Before you make a purchase visit with the monkey youd like to buy and make sure you have a connection and can see yourself living with the monkey Never purchase a monkey from outside the country Its illegal to ship a monkey from outside the United States   Before you bring a monkey home its important to establish a relationship with an exotic animals veterinarian A regular veterinarian will not have the necessary expertise and equipment to care for a monkey Monkeys are prone to catching some of the same illnesses that humans have as frequently as humans so you can expect that your monkey will get sick from time to time An exotic animals vet will also be a good resource for you when you have questions about your monkeys needs or behavioral issues Your pet monkey might spend time out of his cage but hell need a place to stay at night and during times when you arent available to play A monkeys cage should be quite large the bigger the betterMonkeys need plenty of room to run around explore and play especially if theyre going to spend more than an hour or two at a time in the cage If the cage is too small the monkey will become agitated and potentially aggressive   You can purchase a monkey cage but many owners prefer to build their own so they can customize them to their personal space Wooden or steel poles and chainlink fencing make good materials for monkey cages You may want to have an outdoor monkey cage as well as one indoors or build a monkey cage attached to a heated outdoor shed that will provide shelter for the monkey Be sure to follow your states regulations regarding the dimensions entryways and locks on monkey cages In some cases the regulations differ according to what type of monkey you own Monkeys like to climb so provide a cage with plenty of height Add branches hanging ropes and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage   Most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house rather than just in their cages Monkeys are curious intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them so youll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage Since monkeys can climb your monkeyproofing will have to be more extensive than babyproofing would be   Dont let monkeys have access to anything with a cord Make sure all electronics are out of their reach Theyll tear down curtains knock over lamps and chew on furniture Put away any items you arent comfortable letting them destroy You might want to have one or two designated monkey rooms that the monkeys are allowed to play in and have the rest of the house be offlimits Remember that monkeys can turn doorknobs and open windows so if youre planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised youll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be with locks and bars on the windows   Monkeys keep their own bodies clean but they leave a mess wherever they go They arent easy to housetrain and they excrete whenever and wherever they choose Some people put diapers on baby monkeys but this isnt usually possible once the monkeys mature Rather you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home   Monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles You can use baby bottles for this purpose Some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish and some might like to have both options However you administer the water make sure theres no chance the monkey will run out   Monkey biscuits or commercial monkey food should be fed to your monkey every single day These biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkeys needs In addition to monkey biscuits monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or steamed vegetablesYou may also feed your monkey grasshoppers mealworms cooked chicken with no spices hard boiled eggs yogurt rice grain and nuts Do not feed your monkey anything that is considered junk food for a human Sugary treats ice cream baked goods snack foods fast food and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey Depending on the type of monkey you have you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins Monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin D to account for the lack of sun exposure   Monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy In the wild they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food Simulate that experience in your monkeys cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart   Try hiding the monkeys food inside a box or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into The monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food Give the monkey stuffed animals balls and other toys to throw around and play with Switch out the toys frequently so the monkey wont get bored   Monkeys are social creatures and when theyre left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy Spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day As you bond with your monkey hell start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses   If you have more than one monkey less social time is necessary Many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind If you can afford more than one theyll live happily together in the same cage   Hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you Its also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkeys behavior Remember that monkeys are wild and they simply cant be trained to do exactly what you want them to do From time to time theyll exhibit behaviors you might not like Punishing them will only hurt your relationship   The best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isnt lacking something that he needs to be content Does he have enough stimulation every day Is he getting plenty of exercise Are you playing with him enough Monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time Again you cant deal with this by punishing the monkey Instead get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite   Its not a good idea to take your monkey out in public or invite people to your home to play with him Monkeys are too unpredictable Your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens If your monkey so much as scratches someone an Animal Control officer has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies When exotic animals are confiscated they are often euthanized since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs   If you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone elses care make sure its someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust Leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences   Say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy so hell begin to learn it When he responds give him a treat and praise him Teach him commands by showing him how to act For example if you say dance start hopping around and dancing When he learns a trick give him treats and praise him
But be careful almost over does not mean completely over Indeed you just delivered a very unpleasant message and you need to make sure that it has been perfectly understoodTry to ask simple yesno questions such as Are you OK or Do you understand what I am telling you You should avoid questions such asÂ What do you think What you said is not open to discussion and heshe does not have a say in it It is your decision and there is nothing else to say about it   People tend to misinterpret this kind of meaningless move You do not want himher to secretly think OK i got your message but your body language clearly indicates that you actually want more of me   Your mission here has been accomplished and you need to move on Do not look back There is nothing to feel bad about You had to do it and you mastered it This is how nice people handle adult situations
Assume that your crush is making a weird not funny joke Give them a chuckle and then move on Smile at the person and laugh a little bit in a natural way   This strategy works especially well for questions that seem to be teasing andor not really serious If your crush asks you if you have ten kittens in your backpack theyâre probably not being serious Questions like this seem strange but might just be bad jokes   Take a second and ask yourself if your crush could have been joking Could they want you to say something strange back Have they done this before Try to find a way that their statement could be a joke and then respond accordingly   If your crush asks you âHave you ever been to the Moonâ say âYes I have Just got back this morningâ   If your crush asks you something too personal tell them that you donât want to answer that   Say âI donât really want to answer that questionâ You could also try âIâm not going to answer thatâ Be firm but not mean   If itâs a personal question saying âI donât knowâ indicates that you donât want to answer it If itâs not a personal question about you just say you donât know the answer Itâs truthful and ends the conversation quickly   For example if your crush asks you âHow loudly do you snore at nightâ tell them that you donât know because you are asleepOr if your crush asks you what the capital of a faraway country is say you donât know if you actually donât know   If your crush asks you something really rude or disrespectful you should tell them that their question made you uncomfortable If the person is worth dating they will respect you and try to understand your point of view   You can say âThat question makes me uncomfortable and I donât want to answer it Please donât ask me questions like this againâ   Change the subject quickly Do not feel the need to continue having this strange conversation Ask your crush about a common interest of yours their school or workplace the weather current events or anything else that interests either you or your crushYou can also say that you have to go Make up an excuse to get out of the situation You do not have to stay if you feel disrespected or uncomfortable
Are you making the statement you wish to make or do you need to make some style adjustments This might be as simple as ironing out the wrinkles or as complicated as coming up with new fun ways to wear your existing clothes  Thats the easiest and most sensible way to land a guy who is going to relate to the real you Avoid going overboard to impress or act differently itll just embarrass him and cause him to keep away   Find the brave inside of you to strike up a conversation and have a good chat Talk about school sports teachers whatever If you miss this vital part of trying to get to know him no amount of hair flicking flirting or dropping binders in the hallway when he passes will cause him to feel impressed by you   Ask him questions about his interests and hobbies outside of school Share a little information about what youre interested in too   Work onto the longer ones later for now just enough to be interesting   Theres no need to overdo it and embarrass him in front of the others   Avoid flirting with other guys in his presence Hell just figure youre not the slightest bit interested   He wont be impressed by someone whose marks dip or sporting performance falls short because youre too obsessed with him   Staying on track with the things that are important to your development and future is more impressive than flirting or making gaga eyes all day Itll also reassure him that youre not the clingy type Hell appreciate the space you leave him   However dont pressure him or push him into going out with you he wont Dont keep asking until he says yes eitherââleave it be and let him think things over   If he says no to that just shrug and say okay Hell come around sooner or later He might see how you didnt really care and really want you
Remember that rejection is difficult Your friend might lash out or retreat inwards and blame themselves for the situation No matter their reaction you need to make sure youâre respectful and treat them with dignity Telling your friend to âman upâ or to âstop being a babyâ is a sure fire way of making them feel worse about the whole situation   If your friend lashes out and starts insulting their crush tell them that while you understand how they feel they should avoid using insults Remind them that itâs not helpful or kind to lob insults even when youâre in pain Your friend in their pain and frustration might react by taking it out on you Donât take this to heart youâre not to blame Rejection is hard and your friend might be lashing out at the first target they see to vent their frustrations While helping your friend through their feelings you can remind them that they shouldnât attack you   If your friend asks why you told them explain to that itâs for their own good you didnât want to see them pursue someone whoâs not interested in them   Donât think your job is done once youâve told your friend the truth about their crush After delivering the hard truth make sure you stick around to support your friend   Help by thinking of solutions If you can think of a better match for your friend try to get your friend thinking about them instead If your friend has a big project coming up soon try to help them focus on that Itâs important to help your friend remember that theyâre still someone worthy of love The important thing is to help them save face just because this crush doesnât like them doesnât mean no one else will Use compliments Reinforce your friendâs qualities by saying them out loud Remind them that these things make them a great catch and that someone will see that too
Dont beat yourself up if you think you messed up or said the wrong thing This will only make you continue to feel shy and lack confidence the next time you try to engage with guys Instead of thinking things like âThat was stupidâ or âIâm terrible at thisâ think of how to do better next time If you find yourself rehashing the scene over and over get out of your own head by talking to friends reading a good book or doing something else that makes you feel goodInstead of thinking negatively remind yourself Its okay to say the wrong thing or I dont need to impress anyone When youre thinking of how to do better next time practice what to say in the mirror or role play with friends   The guy you are talking to may be just as shy as you are Part of building confidence is learning to understand that itâs okay to not know everything to not always say the right thing   Doing or saying the wrong thing is a great learning experience Most people learn more from the things they get wrong than those they get right Look at âfailureâ when talking to guys as a chance to learn how to do better next time Remember itâs okay to say or do the wrong thing If you accidentally offend a guy youâre talking to say something like âIâm so sorry I get nervous and say the wrong thing sometimesâ Most people will completely understand this You might have heard the saying âIf you fall off the horse you should get right back onâ This is very apt when it comes to building confidence If you say the wrong thing and the guy doesnât want to talk to you thatâs okay Try again some other time Talk to guys who may need your help If you notice a guy whoâs struggling in math class offer to help him with his homework Talking about something you excel at makes you feel more confident and it takes some of the pressure and stress out of situations where you may feel shy Repetition is one of the best ways to develop a skill The more you do it the easier it is so one of the best ways to feel less shy is to just keep talking to guys Youâll soon discover that even if the guy doesnât like you or doesnât want to talk to you youâre still just fine and there are other guys to chat with It can be as simple as âI will talk to one new guy this weekâ or I will talk to at least one guy at the party this weekend If you feel like your shyness is really impacting your personal educational or professional goals you may want to set a more aggressive goal for overcoming your shyness Consider something like âI will talk to one or more guys for five minutes every day this weekâ Build up this goal from there until it feels natural to engage in conversations with guys
You should work on developing the characteristics that would make you appeal to an older woman but you shouldnt forget to keep things fun There must be something she likes about hanging out with or even dating a younger guy  one of those things could be that younger guys have less baggage than older guys and less worries about their college classes jobs or whatever it is the guys in her age bracket normally worry about   Theres a difference between being immature and goofing off Every woman loves to goof off from time to time so dont be afraid to show her the silly aspects of your personality Make her laugh If your sense of humor is one of your best features dont hide it because you worry itll make you look immature if you try to make her laugh As long as you pick relatively tasteful jokes youll be fun Keep it light Though you want her to see that you have depth you dont have to talk about the most serious thoughts you have late at night the second you meet her Have a good time first  the rest will come later   Dont think of being younger as a hindrance  instead it should be something that appeals to the woman Your boyish good looks amazing dance moves or goofy jokes can be exactly what the woman likes about you Dont say I know Im only seventeen but Instead act like you love being seventeen and that the world is your oyster   Maybe you havent done that many things but you can impress the woman by talking about all of the things you will do and how excited you are about life Impress her with your energy and enthusiasm You may be a lot more energetic than guys her own age  and thats a good thing   Though you obviously cant  or shouldnt  hide your age you should avoid topics that make her realize how young you really are If shes a college student and youre only in high school then you shouldnt talk too much about the Homecoming game your tenth period math class or about that time when you got detention for talking back to a teacher   You shouldnt hide highschool like aspects of your life but you shouldnt emphasize them either Talk about your family friendships or current events  make her see you outside your high school bubble If youre both in high school or college but youre a freshman and shes a senior talk more about the things you want to do later in your coursework instead of what its like to be brandnew at a school Its likely that shes matured a lot between her freshman and senior year and if shes constantly reminded that youre only a freshman shell see that you may have a lot of growing up to do   An older woman will have more mature friendships more varied and intense interests and a more busy schedule Though you may want nothing more than to spend as much time as possible with this woman you need her to see that you have your own friends your own schedule and your own needs   If you start dating each other seriously then you may start spending a lot of time together but if youre just trying to attract her and get her attention you cant be clingy or shell be turned off If she does hang out with you dont say When can I see you again right away Play it cool and ask her out a few days later Talk about your schedule Let her see that you have a lot going on too If she thinks that all you do is sit at home and play video games and wait for her to call shell be less eager to hang out with you
The most common knots used to tie a horse are quickrelease knots of which there are several varieties and the bowline knot Quickrelease knots are easy to tie and while they will tighten up if the horse pulls against the rope are still easy to release with a quick tug of the trailing rope The bowline is a bit less convenient to tie and untie but will not tighten up if the horse pulls on it Also some horses are quite adept at untying quick release knots If you are going to leave your tied horse unsupervised or know that he has untied a quick release in the past the bowline is the safer option Practice tying these knots ahead of time before you use them with an actual horse  This quickrelease knot should not tighten if your horse pulls against it and is very easy to untie   First make a fold in the rope called a ââbightââ and fold it over the pole you are tying to or through a ring Then make another bight in the part of the rope that leads to the horse called the âstanding endâ Pull the second bight through the first bight Then with your other hand make a bight in the loose end of the rope and pull this through the second bight To tighten the knot pull on the standing end To release the knot simply tug on the loose end   This quickrelease knot is easy to tie and untie and can be finished off in a daisychain fashion to take up extra rope and prevent your horse pulling or tripping on the loose end First loop the rope over a pole or through a ring Then twist the loose end of the rope to form a loop Hold the loop in your left hand and with your right hand wrap the loose end over the standing end Fold the loose end over into a bight and pull the bight through the loop in your left hand Pull on the standing end to tighten the knot Pull on the loose end to release the rope To create an extrasecure knot that is harder for your horse to untie create another bight in the loose end of the rope and feed it through the last loop Repeat this daisychain process as many times as needed to use up the loose end of the rope   This is a secure knot that will not tighten if the horse pulls on it You can untie it quickly but your horse cannot   First take the standing end of the rope in your left hand and wrap the loose end over the pole Then twist a loop in the standing end and feed the loose end through the loop Then wrap the loose end back over the standing end and through the loop again going the other way Pull firmly on both the loose and standing ends to snug the knot Never wrap a rope around your hand or finger or put your hand inside or through any loop or bight while tying up a horse If the horse were to jerk quickly the loop could tighten on your hand and cause serious injury Be careful to avoid doing this while you practice tying knots to avoid learning unsafe knottying habits
If you suspect you may have an allergy to guinea pigs or any other potential allergen the first thing you should do is visit an allergist An allergist can help you determine whether or not your guinea pig is the problem and advise you on how to limitavoid exposure and treat your symptomsAllergists treat both allergies and asthma especially asthma induced by an allergic reaction Your allergist will most likely conduct a round of tests which may include skin exposure tests to confirm that guinea pigs are the source of your allergies See an allergist right away if you experience prolonged allergy symptoms coughingwheezing shortness of breath or any other quality of life issues associated with a suspected allergy In rare cases extreme allergies may cause anaphylaxis a potentially fatal reaction If you experience vomiting diarrhea a sudden drop in blood pressure difficulty breathing a swollen tongue or throat loss of consciousness or severe hives or skin redness go to an emergency room immediately  Antihistamines are one of the most commonlytaken allergy medications They are available over the counter or by prescription and they come in tablet syrup or nasal spray formsAntihistamines reduce your bodys immune system response to allergens An antihistamine can help reduce itchy skin sneezing and runny nose Common overthecounter tablets include fexofenadine Allegra loratadine Claritin Alavert and cetirizine Zyrtec Common prescription tablets include levocetirizine Xyzal and desloratadine Clarinex Frequentlyprescribed nasal sprays include azelastine Astelin and Astepro and olopatadine Patanase   Decongestants reduce nasal swellinginflammation which can make it easier to breathe if youre experiencing sneezing or stuffy nose They are often sold as nasal sprays and can typically be acquired without a prescriptionSome overthecounter allergy medications pair antihistamines and decongestants together in one oral tablet Decongestants arent for everyone They can have serious negative side effects for some individuals including elevated blood pressure If you currently have high blood pressure glaucoma cardiovascular disease or an enlarged prostate do not take decongestants unless your doctor has told you it is safe to do so   Corticosteroid nasal sprays are inserted into the nostril sprayed and inhaled This class of medicine is typically administered in low doses and tend to have far fewer side effects than oral corticosteroidsCommon nasal sprays that are available without a prescription include fluticasone Flonase mometasone furoate Nasonex and triamcinolone Nasacort AQ If overthecounter nasal sprays arent enough ask your doctor whether prescriptionstrength corticosteroids might help your symptoms   If youre experiencing an allergic reaction to guinea pigs in your home you may find it helpful to use an air filter or purifierThese products help remove allergens from the air reducing respiratory problems and potentially reducing contact of airborne particles with your skin   If you purchase an air filterpurifier make sure you use a highefficiency particulate air HEPA filters and air purifiers HEPA filters and purifiers have been shown to reduce airborne allergens in some environments   If you or a family member are experiencing guinea pig allergies make sure your guinea pig is not permitted to roam freely around the house This can help limit or even eliminate exposure to the allergens which may make it easier to live with a guinea pig in the home for some individualsKeep your guinea pigs cage in a designated area that can be avoided Do not put it in common areas like the living room or kitchen or innear your bedroom The room where you keep your guinea pig should ideally be uncarpeted for ease of cleaning Wood tile linoleum or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would   If youre allergic to guinea pigs its important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animals saliva and urine However that protein can be transferred to the guinea pigs coat or skin during grooming or passing waste and may be transferred to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding Therefore the urine saliva hair and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposureExposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately or after numerous days weeks months or even years of exposure If you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens If contact cannot be avoided make sure you take protective measures   Protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions Protective equipment may not be enough though and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safetyWearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthmalike symptoms if youve experienced those symptoms in the past Gloves and longsleeved shirts can help reduce your skin contact with guinea pigs especially while handling the animals themselves or cleaning their cages Do not wear the longsleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless its been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding   Any time youve handled a guinea pig cleaned its enclosure or handled any materials from inside that enclosure make sure you wash your hands as soon as possibleIts important to follow proper handwashing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reactionGet your hands wet under the faucet with clean running water The temperature doesnt really matter since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs Apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather Work the soap between your hands between your fingers on the backs of your hands and under your fingernails Apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens wrists and arms for example Scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds A common way to keep time is by singing or humming the Happy Birthday song twice in a row while you scrub your skin If youve been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound Rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with Use a clean dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry Discard the paper towel when you are finished   Depending on your situation you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you Ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilitiesIf you work at a pet store let your supervisors know that youve experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling feeding or cleaning them If your guinea pig is a pet at home ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties If you cant find anyone willing to do this you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies wont be a problem   Though its always difficult to part with a pet you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe Talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig You should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyeradopter and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience   If youre experiencing allergies around a guinea pig there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions An allergist can help you identify whether youre allergic to some environmental factor like haystraw used for the animals beddingHay and straw often cause asthmalike reactions including difficulty breathing increased production of mucus and congestion in the chestMany people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with haystrawDermatitis is usually characterized by red itchy or inflamed skin It may look like a rash on the skin usually at the point of exposure Some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding Talk to an allergist or try out a different bedding material thats free from any potential allergensEven if wood shavings themselves arent the problem many people experience allergies to the various coloring fragrances and oils added to guinea pig bedding Eucalyptus oil and Manuka oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding Make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives or try a different bedding material altogether   If bedding isnt the issue there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food youre feeding your guinea pig Handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be whats causing your reaction though only an allergist can confirm this for sureArtificial coloring agents that begin with the letter E such as E110 are commonly added to dried food and treats These coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals though again its more likely that youre allergic to the animal itself or its bedding Talk to an allergist to determine the source of your allergies and find ways to treat or avoid those allergens
Most people really like to talk about themselves It feels good when someone is genuinely interested in your opinion and experiences and wants you to share those thingsAsk about his hobbies or his favorite bands and movies People tend to have a very positive opinion about people who ask them questions about themselves   Make sure you weigh in too The conversation shouldnt be all about him Share your own thoughts and opinions and dont feel you always have to agree with him   You may think that flirting up a storm with other guys will show him that youre desirable and have other options but playing hard to get rarely worksResearch shows that we are more attracted to people who are selective So if youre in a group and none of the other guys seem to hold your attention but you have a big smile just for your crush youre going to catch his interestThis doesnt mean you have to be rude mean or ignore other guys But if you were thinking about flirting with someone just to make your crush jealous you might want to think again   If he knows everything about you right off the bat hell lose the fun and anticipation of slowly getting to know what makes you tick So hold back a little bit Dont call message or text him constantly Give him the time and room to think and wonder about you Let him be curious about you and what youre doing   Dont ignore him or be rude but dont always be available
The guinea pigâs cage should be kept in a quiet area of the house to minimize stress If your guinea pig bites it is most likely that it feels threatened Turn the TV down or off Put other pets if you have any in another room You want the guinea pig to only focus on you Then when you act nicely your guinea pig will associate you with a pleasant experience not stress   If youâve just brought home your guinea pig it will take a while for it to get used to its new home its cage and the room the cage is in Let the guinea pig acclimate Donât immediately start playing with the guinea pig Open the cage and let it investigate the opening It is important to let your guinea pig explore Once it knows its space and where the good hiding places are it will feel more comfortable As the pig gets more relaxed place an exercise pen around the cage on the floor and give the guinea pig time to explore Do this when it is quiet â make sure there are no loud noises and no other pets around Place fresh greens at the edge of the cage door and outside the cage to encourage exploration Donât push Every guinea pig is different and this will take time   Hang out without trying to engage your pig at firstSit next to the cage Talk quietly to the pig Place tasty greens like parsley or dandelion greens in its space Wait for the pig to get more comfortable before reaching out to pet it Eventually you can stick out a finger and let it explore your scent Do not make contact until the guinea pig feels comfortable   Just sit and read or watch TV quietly next to the cage while the pig gets used to your presence Loud noises will frighten the guinea pig so hang out together when the house is quiet and no dogs or cats are around   Make physical contact for short periods Do not grab and hold your guinea pig against its will Once the pig accepts your hand in the cage gradually and gently pet the guinea pig for a few seconds at a time Try petting it behind the ears and on the top of the head at first Only after it is comfortable in its setting and with you petting it should you pick it up Lift it up from under the chest just off the ground and then place it back down immediately Work on this to get it used to being picked upWhen you pick up a pig use one hand to pick it up around the chest and the other to support the hindquarters The guinea pig needs to feel completely supported so it doesnt worry about being dropped Start by sitting on the floor Pick it up and pet the it Keep calm If the pig gets agitated put the pig back down before it feels the need to defend itself with their teeth Remember that nibblingbiting is the guinea pigs way of expressing itself If the guinea pig feels uncomfortable being held by a child and resorts to biting tell the child to put the pig down immediately   Under your supervision have children sit down on the floor with a towel a âCritter Cuddler Blanketâ or âCuddle Cupâ to hold the guinea pigThis way there is a barrier between the child and the guinea pig to protect them both Have the child pet the guinea pig gently and allow the guinea pig to wander away so it does not feel trapped   Donât reward bad behavior If it seems that the guinea pig is biting to get your attention do not reward the behavior by giving attention Come back later and pet the pig when it is calm You will have to read the pigâs body language and if it seem calm and accepting pet it and reward that behavior If you attempt to abate its biting with treats it will associate biting and bad behavior with tasty treats   After a few months of living together you will start to notice the guinea pigâs patterns Avoid bothering the pig when it is napping for instance to decrease the chance of an adverse reaction to your attention This can injure the pig but it will also teach the pig that it needs to defend itself against you  leading to more bitingIt might be your gut reaction to lash out at a guinea pig after it bites you Donât give in to this instinct Think about why the guinea pig resorted to biting and change your behavior   If someone held you against your will and you were afraid had to urinate or were hungry would you consider biting You donât have another way of communicating so you probably would sink your teeth into their hand too
When you disagree with him gauge how he reacts Reading his responses as âgoodâ or âbadâ is tricky but generally accept it as a good sign when he argues his own points with you Take it to mean that he wants you to understand exactly where he stands so that you know exactly who youre withNo two people hold the exact same opinions so be wary if he always agrees with you If he does consider it likely that heâs more interested in enjoying himself here and now than in building a longterm relationship where knowing and resolving differences in opinion will really matter   He doesnât have to agree with you in the end but at the very least expect him to consider what youâre saying before responding But if he always barrels on with his own opinions as if you never said anything at all he probably cares more about being ârightâ than about having a real exchange of ideas   Watch out for putdowns and insults Judge how much he cares about you by his willingness to hurt you just because you disagree If he calls you or your ideas âstupidâ or anything like that take that as a red flagAlso note the way he talks to you Even if he doesnât insult you outright recognize when heâs still being dismissive and âtalking downâ to you
Guys like you more if you are just laid back and cool about things If someone spills something on your Tori Burch handbag dont cry and whine even though you may want to If you fall in the hallway or slip just laugh at yourself in public You can hit yourself in the head as much as you want to when youre alone  Most guys dont like the girls that have the huge black fake eyelashes the thick eyeliner or the blood red lipstick Embrace your natural beauty Try going without make up or just wearing minimal makeup For everyday makeup try wearing neutral colors like brown rather than black around your eyes   Makeup should add glow not color   Try to find clothes that fit you and enhance the good features of your figure Yes this does mean that going to the store and trying on the clothes is better than ordering them online where youre not sure if they will fit or not but its good to know what youre buying is perfect for you Also dont feel like you should wear your lowest top or shortest skirt to impress him Itll do the opposite and make you look cheap shallow and desperate   Guys love girls who have hobbies Its okay not to play a lot of sports but some guys tend to like girls who can throw a ball or shoot a basket When sport season starts try encouraging your friends to join a sport team with you and maybe try to learn a few things about the sports your crush likes   Having a good body will make you more confident and guys find confidence in a girl very attractive Try small things like replacing your daily chocolate bar with an item of fruit cutting down on the amount of TV you watch and walking rather than using transport which is environmentally friendly too If you want a drastic change with your figure then start a fitness regime and ask friends or family to do it with you for support   Everyone yes boys and girls love someone who can smile and laugh Try to be optimistic and look at the glass as half full as opposed to half empty   As long as you take care of your hair and dont walk around looking like youve been dragged through a hedge backwards then dont worry Also dont worry about hair colour some guys like blonds some like brunettes some like red heads everyone has different taste   It could be anything even a small thing Maybe a hobby such as dance or art or a certain sport Or it could be a phrase or saying that you have nothing annoying though and dont say it too often Or perhaps something about the clothes you wear try dressing slightly different to the people around you as friends are often highly influenced by each others taste in fashion Dont buy loads of shocking clothes but just dont copy too much
Hug them goodbye wish them luck with life and leave with pride If you have good self esteem you know that it is their loss  Blast angry loud music and let it out   They will be able to make you laugh and say all the right things to make you feel better such as Youâre too sweet pretty nice popular and smart for your expartner   Have a long good cry   Put them in a box for a time when youâre less emotional and want to look back at them Do not act hastily and throw out or burn things you may want them in the future   Then delete the emails and give the paper copies to a friend to keep in a safe place This will prevent you from going back and obsessing over the emails but they will still be there if you want them in the future   Donât look like youâre trying but always look good so that they regret their decision   Even though you may still like them make them think that they have to win you back and that you have other prospects out there waiting for you   Make them think you chose to be back with them rather than other people that asked you out

There are many places where sitting next to a girl that you like can be a great way to introduce yourself or get to know her further Ideally you want to choose somewhere where you can initiate a conversation Somewhere where she is likely to have an empty seat next to herSit in the desk next to her before class Try finding a seat next to her in the cafeteria  Timing is everything when talking to someone you have a crush on You donât want them to see you as a nuisance or an interruption If the girl you like seems busy doing homework or talking to someone on her cellphone this may not be the best time to approach herBefore or after class is a good time Choose a seat next to her during study hall   Show that you are courteous and thoughtful by asking her if you can sit next to her You also want to make sure no one else has that seat claimed like maybe a friend of hers before you just jump into it   âIs someone already sitting in this seatâ âDo you mind if I sit hereâ If it turns out she was busy apologize for interrupting   No woman is under any obligation to talk to you Also if she says this isnât a good time or that she would rather sit alone youâll go further toward earning her respect by be being mindful of her wishes Say something like âOh okay Maybe another timeâ And then walk away graciously   Donât sit down anyway if she says no Realize that your crush may just be having a bad day or might be trying to focus on other things Just because she said no today doesnt mean shell say no next time   When you sit next to your crush be sure not to intrude on their personal space You want to be close enough so that you can easily carry on a conversation but not so close that your knees touch when you turn to face her   When choosing the desk next to your crush in class donât pull it closer to hers She may find this to be an overly aggressive gesture If you strike up a conversation and feel like the desks are too far apart to continue comfortably you may want to slide it over a bit but generally you should just leave it where it is If you take a seat next to her on a bench like on the playground or at a table in the lunch room leave several inches between you   Donât slouch Sit with your spine straight and your shoulders back Keep your head up You might want to turn your body slightly so that you are facing your crush more directly   Maintaining good posture will not only make you look more confident it can increase your energy level and actually affect your hormones making it more likely that youâll be positive and clear headed while you speak Tapping your fingers on the desk shaking your legs or constantly readjusting your glasses will just make you look nervous It will also act as a distraction for your crush which will make it hard for her to focus on what you have to say   Take deep breathes Fold your hands and rest them on the desk or table in front of you If there is no table rest them in your lap You donât have to keep your hands still the whole time Many of us use our hands to gesture while we speak but when they are idle keeping them folded will help keep you from fidgeting too much Take a quick inventory of your body every few minutes Maybe while she is talking or when there is a small break in the conversation Check in with yourself If you feel your leg bouncing or an urge to keep moving around in your seat take a deep breath and try to relax Bring your focus back to your crush
After you have made your first connections you want to continue messaging him and having conversations to keep the connection you have made with him strong One way to make your connection stronger and keep your conversation interesting is to ask him his opinions on things   Whatever you have in common be it books movies food etc think about good questions to ask him that are open ended and will start interesting conversation For example if you both love Harry Potter you can ask âSo what do you think is the best Harry Potter bookâ And feel free to completely agree or disagree with him These kinds of disagreements can lead to banter and can be pretty fun to have You can start by telling him something that you have an opinion of and then ask his opinion on it This question can also be related to the context of where you are or what you are doing For example if you are eating an apple at lunch you could say âI think that Granny Smith are the best apples period but out of curiosity what kind of apple is your favoriteâ Once again being playful is a good way to make your conversation more fun especially when you are talking about simple topics and just getting your conversation going Come up with a few different questions you can ask him before you talk to him because topics of conversation can go more quickly than you realize   He will want to keep talking to you if you have fun when you talk An example of banter is if you raise an eyebrow when he tells you that his favorite apple is Red Delicious and you say something silly like âYou are saying you like Red Delicious apples best Well I guess we canât all be perfectâ Guys like this kind of silly banter because it is low pressure and fun Banter is great because you two donât have to talk about anything in particular but you are still making a connection   Practice bantering with your friends and family Find silly things to disagree with them on Playfully disagreeing can be good for your other relationships too   Try not to use small talk or getting to know you questions like âWhatâs going onâ or âSo where are you fromâ These questions are not very interesting and you wonât learn much about him because he may give you an answer that he has already used many times before You want him to come away from this conversation excited to talk to you again so stay away from small talk   Everyone wants to feel good about themselves and if you can provide that for him he will most likely want to keep talking to you So get good at telling him why you like him with small genuine compliments You donât have to make it a big deal you can casually tell him why he is great In fact avoid making a big show of it For example while you are walking somewhere and if you notice he is usually good with directions you can say âI like that you always seem to know how to get us where we are goingâ  One way to keep your guy wanting to talk to you more is if you leave the conversation at the right time The best way to end a conversation is to first find a place after you have made good connections and before the conversation has started to wind all the way down Then think about why you need to get home and after you have laughed or made a connection about something let him know you need to get going Make sure you tell him you really enjoyed yourself and look forward to talking to him again   Be casual and cool when you end the conversation Say something like âHey it was so fun talking to you I think I need to get home and get on my homework but I really look forward to hanging out with you soonâ Make good eye contact with him when you leave Let your eye contact linger a second longer and smile at him a little brighter or slyer when you do   Depending on your conversation style and the guy you like regularly can mean different things Start messaging him every couple of days and if he is prompt or slow with his answers you can message more often or less often Send him playful or funny comments or questions that engage him   For example ask him for updates on how things are going You can ask him something like âHey how is that midterm paper comingâ Or tell him about something interesting that happened to you or that relates to him from your day You can say something like âRemember eating peanut butter sandwiches because the food trucks were late I can see B lunch is eating all of our foodâ Try to vary the kinds of messages you send Donât only ask for updates or say funny things Try to do a combination of questions and funny comments
If you know what you need to get done in the long run than make sure you remind yourself of those and having a concrete knowledge of what they are can help motivate you  These can be monthly weekly or daily If you know what you want to accomplish academically and extra curricularwise you will have more motive to reach those goals It might help to write a to do list so you can check off homework or other goals as you accomplish them   Get involved in your school or outside with volunteer work or community service Make sure you find something you enjoy because not only can it be fun but it can look good for colleges and keep your mind off any certain boys   There is a time to work and a time to play If you keep them separate everything will work out better

Having fresh kissable breath is a major component of having a knockout first kiss Make sure that you have brushed your teeth and used mouthwash some time before the kiss or that you chewed minty gum or sucked on a breath mint before the kiss You can do this an hour or so before  you dont want your breath to be too minty or it will look like you tried a little too hard to get ready for the kiss   If you had dinner or ate before the kiss you should avoid ordering any foods that are heavy in garlic onions or any intense spices  Its important to share your first kiss in an intimate or romantic atmosphere Your first kiss may be something you remember for the rest of your lives so you should make it special You dont have to bring out a thousand candles or serenade the person but you should pick the ideal time and place for a kiss   Kiss in the evening Kissing as the sun is setting or after it has fallen is more romantic than kissing during the day Youll also feel less shy about your first kiss if youre kissing in the dark Kiss somewhere private Pick a private location that is free of distractions or onlookers so you can really focus on your kiss Pick a secluded park bench a nice spot near a beach or a lake or even your own balcony Look nice Dress up a little bit to signify that youre about to have a special moment You dont want to have your first kiss in your gym clothes   This is an important point You can set the mood and prepare your breath all you want but nothing you do will matter if your partner is not ready for the kiss Before you share the kiss make sure your partner has exhibited signs of liking you whether its through going on a date touching you or even telling you how he or she feels   If your partner keeps gazing into your eyes touching you lightly and smiling then youll know that shes ready for the kiss   Before you get ready for the kiss you need to make sure to take it slow and to be gentle If youre too aggressive or rough your partner will get the wrong message and the kiss will feel too forced Here are some things to avoid before you go in for your first kiss   French kissing Dont immediately shove your tongue in your partners mouth and leave saliva everywhere If your partner is bold and is gently touching her tongue with yours then you can move in for a French kiss but dont try this in the first few seconds of your traditional kiss Biting Nibbling on your partners lip or even tongue can be a kinky way to spice up your kisses But if you do this during your first kiss your partner will be caught off guard and may even jump back The roaming hands You should make physical contact with your partner move your bodies closer and caress your partners head or shoulders with your hands You should not grope your partner in any inappropriate places during your first kiss This is doing way too much at once and will come off as sleazy and will make your first kiss feel insincere   Start moving closer to the person you want to kiss whether its by moving closer together if youre sitting down putting your arm around the person or brushing away the persons hair As you start touching the person hold his gaze to make your intentions clear  Your first kiss will feel more natural if youre already touching the person and comfortable with it Your hands shouldnt rove to any inappropriate places  keep it PG Your physical contact could even start from some light and gentle teasing You can playfully hit or lightly push the other person until your actions become more serious Try making a romantic compliment before you go in for the kiss Just say Your eyes drive me crazy or You look so beautiful tonight   Once youve made physical contact maneuver yourself until your face is just inches away from your partners face You should maintain eye contact and you can even smile a little to show your affection for the person   Move closer until your hips are nearly touching and use your hands to graze the persons cheeks hair or shoulders One traditional kissing position is when the guy wraps his arms around a girls waist while she wraps her arms over her shoulders and behind his neck  you can think of this as the slow dance position   Once youre in position theres nothing left to do but kiss Dont hesitate If youve both made it this far then its clear that you are excited about kissing each other Gently lean closer and lock lips Just remember to take it slow Have your lips touch softly as you feel the person out Keep your lips just slightly parted and continue kissing the person for five or ten seconds before letting go   Keep your hands active while you kiss Use your hands to cup the persons face stroke his hair or caress his neck You dont have to overdo it with the hands Just make sure your whole body is engaged so your kiss is even sweeter   Slowly pull away from the person Dont abruptly stop the kiss and pull away with your whole body jumping miles apart from your kissing partner Instead maintain physical contact while pulling away and holding your partners gaze Keep stroking your partner lightly with your hands to let her know how great the kiss was   Take your time to pull away from physical contact If youre too abrupt your partner may think youre not into it   If you just cant break physical contact or you keep staring in your partners eyes then you should keep the kissing train rolling Lightly stroke your partners hair or cheek and move in for another kiss You should still take it slow as you feel the other person out but you can be a bit more bold and adventurous as your kissing progresses   If it feels right you can slowly move in for the French kiss Just make sure your partner is also gently using his tongue so you dont catch him off guard   If the first kiss wasnt as good as you expected dont worry First kisses are often awkward because both people are still getting to know each other and your kissing will improve with practice You can take a break and try another time when it feels right   Even if it doesnt go well you should still gently pull away from the person and move on Dont dwell on what happened and visualize success for your next kiss

This is easy if you are already lab partners in science class or you work together in the same office However you may have a crush on a guy whom youâve never actually talked to If this is the case there are several ways you can let him know who you are without seeming like youâre stalking himIf you have mutual friends have one of them introduce you If he works at a store or cafÃ you frequent make sure to go there regularly when he works Ask him questions about items on the menu or things that they sell Be friendly and thank him for helping you Like his photos or posts on social media if you are connected that way If youâre coworkers or classmates but donât normally interact find a reason to Organize an office party and see if he wants to volunteer Sit near him in class and ask to borrow a pencil  You never know or maybe you do when youâll run into this guy Just in case you do you want to look good so that youâll feel confident about the interaction Wear clothes that you feel show off your personality and make you look and feel special   If you have a favorite accessory such as a special hat wear it It can become part of your trademark look and help boost your confidence and make you seem memorable You want to look your best but make sure you also dress appropriately You donât want to show up to work in something too revealing just to impress him or wear your fanciest outfit to a regular day at school   This can be an intimidating step if youâre naturally shy However most people are happy to meet a new person and feel at ease when someone takes the time to introduce themselves politelyKeep it simple If you frequent his place of work and heâs become familiar with your face simply say âHi Iâm Jane I donât think Iâve gotten your name yetâ next time you go in there You can say âI see you around a lot but I donât think weâve actually met Iâm Moniqueâ   People always remember when someone compliments them Itâs flattering and lets them know that you noticed something about them Find something you can tell him you appreciate about either his appearance or something heâs done Heâll associate you with the positive feelings of the complimentTell him you like a piece of clothing particularly if thereâs something you can identify about it For example you could say âNice Tshirt I love that band tooâ Compliment him on his work You can say âYou always make the best lattesâ or âYouâre a really good lab partnerâ   Flirtatious eye contact can come in a few different forms Generally you need to maintain eye contact for at least four seconds before coyly looking down or away Holding his gaze this long lets him know youâre flirtingIf youâre feeling really bold and sexy you can subtly lick your lips This is considered rather forward so make sure you know what youâre doing Thereâs a difference between flirting and staring Make sure youâre reading his signals and responding not just staring at him   It may seem obvious but if youâre feeling very nervous or shy you may forget to smile However smiling is important It sends the signal that youâre friendly and approachable It also shows that you may be interestedSmiling with your teeth showing and your eyes creasing around the edges conveys warmth and gives the appearance that youâre genuinely excited to see him   If you feel very shy around this guy thatâs perfectly normal However you want to feel comfortable enough to at least say âhelloâYou can wait until he looks at you or catches your eye Once he does say something casual like âHi Howâs it goingâ If you generally say hi to him in the halls or at his or your place of work bump it up a notch by adding something like âGood morningâ or âNice to see youâ   This can be an easier step than saying hello in real life If it wouldnât seem strange become his friend on Facebook or another social media platform This works particularly well if you have mutual friends or run in similar circles   If heâs someone youâve been following on an online dating site or app you can use the app to indicate through your profile that you like his profile When you like his profile or request to be friends it can be a natural time to send a brief message Even something like âHey I really like those pictures you just postedâ can be a conversation starter   This can make you look and sound very confident Say something to him about your surroundings This invites conversation and lets him know youâre interesting to talk toYou can say something like âWow this weather is incredible isnât itâ or âThe coffee at this place is incredibleâ You can also ask him for help or directions Say something like âIâve never been here before Do you have a type of coffee youâd recommendâ or âCan you help me figure out how to get to the library from hereâ   You can save yourself a lot of embarrassment by knowing if the guy you like is available before you do something about it If you donât know him you can try to find out a number a of waysCheck for a wedding ring Online check for photos of him with a significant other Listen when he talks Does he reveal a lot about himself and his life without mentioning a partner Does he keep his eyes moving around the room looking at people This can be a sign that heâs single and looking for love   Doing something nice for him is a great way to let him know you like him without having to actually say anything It can be a small gesture but make sure itâs something heâll notice and appreciate   If you notice that he always shows up to class without a pen or pencil bring one in special for him Give it to him and say something like âI noticed you usually could use one of theseâ If you work somewhere that he frequents give him a small freebie or a discount if you wonât get in trouble If you frequent his place of work leave a generous tip or bring him something For example you could say âYou always make such great sandwiches I thought Iâd bring you some cookies that I made myselfâ   If you canât tell if he likes you or is getting the signals youâre sending you can always be direct This can be very exciting for guys since they wonât have to spend time guessing about your intentionsYou can be direct without being demanding Say something like âIâd really like to get together sometime if youâre interestedâ In being direct you can let him know what you like about him Say something like âYou seem like a really interesting person Would you like to hang out sometimeâ Some people like to be super direct and simply say âI have to tell you that I have a really big crush on youâ This can sometimes be seen as charming but can sometimes put a guy off He might not know what to do with that information or might feel put on the spot   This can be a cute way to let him know youâre interested It can also be a way to slip him your number so that the ball is in his court Keep it simple You donât need to profess your undying love right this second   Write your number on a piece of paper and hand it to him You can say something flirty like âI believe you wanted thisâ If youâve never met before or you have no mutual friends you may not want to give out your number for safety reasons   Of course you have to have his number or be connected to him on social media to do this However if itâs possible this can be a fun and low key way to connect with himSay something more personal and interesting than simply âwhatâs upâ Ask him something based on his profile or ask him for advice about something For example you can say âHey how was that new restaurant I saw you posted pictures of I was thinking I might try it this weekâ   You may be afraid to ask this guy out but heâll likely be flattered Most guys donât get asked out very much so it will probably be extra exciting for him Think ahead of a fun event you want to invite him toChoose something that happens on a specific day such as a concert or a sporting event Donât just choose something like getting a drink Say something like âHey Iâve got an extra ticket to ____ Maybe youâd like to come with meâ
Teenagers tend to be highly insecure They dislike feeling like theyre being judged for their choices Instead of laying on the blame when talking to your teen look for patterns of behavior that are detrimental to a healthy relationship Combating the patterns is more effective than simply chastising your teen for his or her behavior   Try seeing things from your teens perspective Why do you think he or she is resistant to having a healthy relationship with you Where is he or she coming from in regards to the conflict Is there anything youre doing thats ineffective when it comes to communicationDo not worry about who is right Look for the pattern What behaviors are creating a negative home environment and how can the two of you work together mutually to address those behaviors Try beginning a conversation like this I notice that I ask you to do put your dirty dishes in the sink Even when you say you will you dont end up doing it a lot of the time and I end up having to get on your case This causes you to get angry What do you think we can do to solve this problem more effectively  When youre frustrated with a relationship with a family member you may feel inclined to look back at past interactions This is a means to collect evidence with a strong confirmation bias that youre right and your teen is wrong Such a strategy can be detrimental when trying to repair a relationship Youre working on moving forward so dwelling in the past is preventing you from moving beyond negativities of the past When interacting with your teen focus on the present moment and the present problem You cannot force your teen to want to talk to you If you try to pry your teen is likely to pull away However if you strive to simply make yourself available your teen will come to you when he or she is in need   Always let your teen know if they need you you can be there to talk Do not pressure them or make them feel obligated to share Simply say something like If you need me Im always here to chatMake sure your teen knows when he or she can reach you when you might not be readily available Have your work phone number available for emergencies Text your teen if you cant take

non verbal cues you are paying attention to whats said Nod on occasion and say things Yes and Uhhuh Smile and laugh at appropriate timesWhen its your turn to speak take a few moments to reiterate what the other person said Briefly summarize the points they made something like I understand you feel like or Im hearing youre feeling very If a friend or romantic partner feels hurt by something you did

Let it all out on paper You dont need to keep what youve written unless you want to The act of writing can help you to sort out your feelings and face facts about how wrong this person was for you   Plan a birthday party think about visiting a cousin or getting a new pet Find things to distract you from obsessing about this person and their behavior   Take the dog for lots of walks Use the time to enjoy nature and keeping fit   If its a little too embarrassing to talk about it to your mom or dad tell your older sister your grandparent or even your school guidance counselor
Raise your hand smile and say hi when you see them This simple exchange can allow your crush to start really noticing you Itâs also a great way to open conversations and your crush may respond to your greeting by asking you a question You might find that youâre too nervous to say anything every time you try to talk to your crush To avoid this come up with a list of simple questions that can allow the two of you to begin chatting when you bump into each other Once you break the ice with the first question itâll be much easier to keep the conversation going âHow are youâ is the most natural question in the world Itâs an expected next step after someone says hello so your crush wonât be weirded out when you ask them this question Itâs also not a question that you can answer with just a quick yes or no so itâs perfect for opening up a more indepth interactionTry saying something like âHey Tom whatâs up Did you have a good weekendâ   Talking about the weather is easy because everyone experiences it Itâs also not something that people usually disagree on Most people enjoy sunshine and donât love it when there are too many cloudy or rainy days in a row These discussions can help you get comfortable talking to your crush without venturing into emotional or personal territory   Ask âDo you happen to know if itâs stopped raining I forgot my umbrella todayâ Or âHave you been outside yet today Itâs beautifulâ   Having a crush on someone who doesnât know your name is especially scary and maybe even depressing But just because they donât know you now doesnât mean it has to stay that way If you walk past them in the hallway a few times a day and make eye contact theyâve already noticed you Add an introduction the next time you see them   Say âI see you around all the time but Iâve never actually gotten your name Iâm Sarahâ   You and your crush may be in a class together or you may work at the same restaurant You may even share a passion for Star Wars These are perfect topics to discuss with your crush as theyâll highlight your similarities and shared experiences Thereâs nothing better than having an inside joke with your crush about your slightly odd manager   You may find yourself overanalyzing every interaction you have with your crush Maybe youâre feeling embarrassed because you stammered through a greeting or revealed a strange personal detail about yourself by accident Take a deep breath You probably remember the conversation much better than they do   Tell yourself that youâve got another chance to show them who you are tomorrow Thereâs no point in dwelling on what happened yesterday or this morning   Itâs easy to gossip or complain about something or someone so this may be what comes out of your mouth when youâre nervous But try as hard as you can to keep your complaints to a minimum in interactions with your crush Instead focus on what you like about the world around you This will allow you both to enjoy your chats with one anotherFor example donât say âI really hate Mr Smithâs class Heâs such a painâ Instead go with âMr Smith is tough but his classes are interesting What do you think about his latest assignmentâ   Everyone enjoys receiving nice and genuine compliments about themselves Try to avoid complimenting only your crushâs appearance Instead share comments that make your crush aware that you appreciate their personality talents and strengthsFor example if you saw them give a presentation that day tell them how much you enjoyed it You could also take the opportunity to compliment them on one of the aspects of their personality that you like about them Say âyou know youâre a really good listenerâ Or âItâs awesome that you take the time to help other people with their problemsâ
Tell him itâs not something you do Workplace relationships are always a bad idea What may seem fun at first can turn into something terrible if you break up Let him know that workplace relationships are not something you engage in   Simply tell him âNothing personal but I donât date people I work withâ If he persists tell him again that you donât date coworkers Then leave it at that Let him know that getting into a relationship outside of work could jeopardize your careers This is particularly the case when there are rules at your job against dating coworkers Let him know clearly that you canât go out on a date because it could mess up a career or job that youâve worked hard for and that you need   You could say to him âI appreciate your honesty but I prefer to keep things between us professional I donât want to cross the line and jeopardize our work so Iâm going to have to say noâ Avoid telling them why you are declining if it is something you donât like about them Instead put all of the blame on you This will likely make working with them and seeing them easier   For instance go along the lines of âItâs not you itâs meâ Let him know you think heâs great but dating someone you work with just isnât something youâre interested in You may be wary of making trouble at your workplace but you have a right to work in an environment where you dont feel harassed If the guy keeps bothering you take the issue to a supervisorYou might say Justin keeps pressuring me to go out with him At first I didnt think it was a big deal but its gotten to a level where I feel uncomfortable working with him I dont know what to do Can you help
You should always give your guy the opportunity to realize for himself that you like him so that he can do something about it if he wants to Be a little flirty and be sure to spend time with him Try to introduce little touches and other hints Just dont drag this on too long   Try biting your lip every time he looks at you or smile nervously Look into his eyes and then turn away slowly  Its important to choose a good time to talk You dont want him to be distracted upset about something else or just downright busy That will kill your chances before you even get started Talk to him about setting aside some good time to talk or try to catch him at a time when you know he wont be busy   Talk to him in private Confessing your crush in front of other people will make him feel pressured and embarrassed and you dont want that People that feel cornered can be unwilling to admit how they really feel Instead get him on his own so that the two of you can have a real hearttoheart   When confessing your feelings you have to just get out there and say how you feel Be confident Guys will think this is sexy You also have to be bold because youre going to need to take the initiative in talking about how you feel and whether the two of you could have anything   The most basic way to confess your crush is to just come right out and say it This can take courage but generally people will appreciate your honesty and will be flattered by your bravery This avoids gimmicks and shows how much you really think theyre worth Here are some examples of how to say it   Hey Brian I thought you deserved to know that I have very strong feelings for you You dont have to return my feelings but I thought it was only right for you to know Michael youre special Youre kind smart and funny and I am so much happier when youre around I want us to be more than friends I hope you see like I do that we could be something really great   Use his interests in order to confess your feelings You can use this simply to give yourself an opening for example by going rock climbing with him or you can use it to confess in a unique way for example by inviting him over and having the Han SoloPrincess Leia flirt scene queued up on your TV   You probably dont remember what mixtapes are but using songs to confess feelings is still a viable option   Find a song you know hell love Ask to borrow a USB drive from him to transfer a file from a schoolwork computer to your personal computer Leave the mp3 of the song on the USB specially named so hell know MIKE  Tessa Wants to Hold Your Hand or some other reference to the song Good song options include I Want To Hold Your Hand by the Beatles Frank Sinatras Lets Fall In Love or Daft Punks Digital Love   You can make him a present to confess your feelings Try to tailor it to your crush and if you two were already friends try to use it to remind him of the wonderful times youve had together   Paint a small wooden box with both of your initials in a heart and fill the box with pics of the two of you hanging out stubs from movies you saw together or other reminders of fun things youve done together Put together a relaxation care package with two movie tickets two bags of candy and a message something like I know you had a hard time with finals last week Id love the chance to wind down with you If youre not interested no worries Take whoever you wantbut Id love the chance to make you laugh until you forget what quadratic polynomials are   Theres nothing more romantic than some oldfashioned letter writing Write him a letter telling him how you feel and put it in his locker or if you know his address mail it to his house You can also leave it in a place where you know hell find it like in his books or his desk   Spritz it with a bit of your perfume to make it extra exciting   Make a YouTube video confessing your crush you probably shouldnt mention him by name Tell him how you feel and why Then email or text him a QR code with the link to the video You can also print out the code and put it in is locker or tape it inside his textbook   Dont break right out into the I love yous and dont talk about the future you want the two of you to have You want to avoid speaking in definite terms about the future because this creates a lot of pressure and expectations for himwhich is stressful and can scare him away   Instead speak in terms of what you want to try or what you hope might become real eventually I hope we can try being more than friends etc   Dont be creepy when you tell him how you feel This means no begging no bargaining and try not to touch him or get into his personal space until you know he feels the same way You also shouldnt cling around him if he needs time to think about what you said   If you can tell him how you feel in person Using social media or a text can come across as not being very serious or worse being a joke This is not how you want to start things with him   You dont want to rush into telling him and if he returns your feelings dont rush into a serious relationship If youre going to go through the torture of confessing you want to be sure that you really like him first right This is can be a long process and one that will continue even if you start dating   Just focus on getting to know him for who he really is by spending time with him and talking about things that are important to you what you both want for the future what your beliefs are and what you like to do for fun   Dont worry about being rejected It can feel awful to be rejected but in a few years you probably wont remember it at all Remember its his loss You dont want to be with someone that doesnt like you as much as you like them anyway You deserve better than that   If he does return your feelings make sure to actually ask him out if he doesnt ask you out You shouldnt feel bad about making your intentions clear or taking initiative like this sometimes its necessary to get what you want out of life With feelings confessed asking him out is as simple as coming up with an idea for a date and taking things from there Just ask   If you strike out with him or if hes a real jerk about rejecting you you might want to take a look at the kinds of guys you find yourself interested in Stop pursuing guys who dont respect you or like you for who you really are You might find you have better luck if you focus on whats important nice guys who have their priorities in the right place

experiences to build happy memories of You can meet new people by taking a class joining a club or even joining an online community   You might feel even if you dont realize it that if you enjoy yourself too soon or you find happiness too soon that it diminishes the worth of the thing you lost But that isnt true And it keeps you from being happy Let yourself have a good time and dont feel bad about it You do deserve to be happy   If you find that youre having trouble getting back to business as usual on your own and that maybe your sadness might be out of control or unusual seek help Dont

tends to come back to haunt us for years and years Its better to get help if you feel the need to repress a memory   An important part of forgetting about the bad things that happen to us is to work on leaving the past behind You cant change the things that have happened but you can move forward and help your sadness mean something Dont give upyou can do it
Place it in front of the withers and slide it a little bit back until its two or three inches in front of where youll place the saddle Remember not to slide the saddle pad forward since this irritates your horses skin   Always use a clean soft dry saddle pad not a dirty or stiff one You should launder your saddle pad about once every week  Be careful to put the saddle on gently Check that it sits comfortably on the horse and isnt too far forward or too far back on either side You can feel along your horses shoulder bone to check that it isnt too far forward or pinching Finally attach the straps on the saddle pad to your saddles billets   After saddling your horse pull the saddle pad up into the gullet of the saddle This secures the pad and prevents it from rubbing uncomfortably against the horse   The girth should be snug enough to hold the saddle on and in place but not so tight that its pinching or restricting your horse A wellfitted girth should have enough space to snugly fit two fingers flat in between the girth and the horse  Remember to attach the girth to the first and last billets of the saddle       Some horses blow up or suck in air so that the girth wont fit tightly If your horse does this lead him to the arena and tighten the girth again before mounting
One way to break the ice is to pay attention to what is going on around you Find something in your environment that you can make a funny comment about For example if it is lunch and the food hasnât arrived yet and you two are waiting outside in the heat you can something silly like âDo you think they going to get us water for this wait or do they just want us to dieâ Guys find playfulness attractive in girls and it will give you something to make a little bond over   Even if you donât think of yourself as a funny person you can still be playfulThis playfulness can help make the conversation fun and low pressure Remember that getting the conversation started is most important thing Donât worry too much about how the ice breaker goes Focus instead on continuing your conversation  One way to get a guy to like talking to you is if you seem like you are having a good time talking with him A few ways you can show you are having fun is if you make eye contact smile often laugh genuinely and lean forward slightly when you are talking When you are talking tilt your head to one side smile and touch your hair neck or clothes But donât over think it just do what feels natural as well Your nonverbal signals should just show him that you are having a good timeLet him know you like messaging with him if you are mostly messaging For example you can say something like âI think youâre pretty fun to text withâ   Write down the things that make you awesome Knowing why you are awesome and not being afraid to show it attracts others Do not be afraid to make mistakes around him Be authentic to the real you quirks and all Relax and laugh when you make mistakes everyone does Do not act like someone you think that he would like instead of being yourself Imagine if someone were acting in a certain way to please you would you like that Probably not   Enjoy laughing and hanging out with other people in his company Showing him that you are fun independent and have your own friends is important to establish   This will show him that friends are important to you and will help him see what you are in like with other people It could make him a little jealous in a good way and maybe heâll want to hang out with you more than before   If you donât have a social media account and he is active on social media get an account Like or retweet something that he has posted If you are both on your social media this could be a good way to start talking Liking and retweeting things he posts on his social media can help build up your friendship and give you an idea of the things he likes Also liking his posts will help you to know what is going on with him   After liking a couple of things that he has posted you should write a comment on a post or send him a message Do not like everything he posts Choose one or two things that you genuinely like and space out the time between your likes to every few days If you send too much attention to him it may come off like you are trying too hard or creepy   If you have been liking or commenting on his posts post things that shows him what you are into He should see your interests just as much as you should see his For example share beautiful or interesting pictures that you have taken or find funny gifs pictures or quotes from the internet which you can post along with a comment about why you like it   For example if he writes a lot of posts about bands he likes and there is a band you both like you can post one of the bandâs music videos or the lyrics from one of their songs with a comment about why you like it Stay true to yourself Only post things that you genuinely like and are a part of who you are It can come off fake if you are posting about things you havenât shown any interest in before   You should make a comment on a post that he writes early after it has been posted If you write the comment early he will be more likely to respond Consider praising the post asking a question about it or commenting about something you find interesting For example if he writes a post about going to a show of the band you like you can respond by saying âI am so jealous you got to see them Did you think they were good liveâ   Avoid commenting too often Make sure to space out your comments   If he seems distant or aloof and isnât responding to you much he may not be interested Luckily there will be other guys who will want to talk to you and who you can have a great connection with Instead of thinking about the interaction with this guy as a failure think about the interactions you have had with him as good practice for having a conversation with another guy down the road
Remember that hes just a boy and if he has any courtesy he wont say anything offensive   This will help to break in the relationship Weeksmonths of talking you should eventually feel comfortable to be around him as a friend   If he already knows you as an acquaintance then you have completed the hardest step which is the introduction If not then try to find mutual friends between the two of you thus giving you ways to introduce yourself   Dont be a mainstream girl be yourself He isnt going to want to date you the 1 out of 100 mainstream girls in his life Hes going to want to date you a unique girl who lets her own personality and style shine   It might sound crazy but establishing long eye contact lets him know that youre listening and paying attention to what he is sayingdoing   If you get sudden spurts of energy or nervousness try pushing your toes together in your shoes unless your wearing open toed shoes it should get rid of some of that energy and nervousness You can also cross your fingers by your side or simply start twiddling your thumbs by your side   When the conversation goes silent change the topic or say you have to go Do not let the conversation go silent for too long the conversation could become quite awkward and make you even more nervous around this boy   Best is to plan when you want to leave so right after he finishes his sentence This shows that you didnt cut him off in the middle of him talking about something he thinks is important thus giving him a good impression of your attentiveness
A guy who likes you is looking for reasons to believe that you like him back Hang out with your other friends Find another place to sit at lunch If you share friends with this guy dont pay so much attention to him when you do hang out After about 15 minutes or so excuse yourself and say you need to be alone or be somewhere else Physical contact is often a form of intimacy Limit it to a friendly handshake a high five or a fist bump Dont hug him hold hands or dance with him Definitely dont kiss him Treat him the same way you treat other friends and acquaintances Cut back on the âlikesâ you give to his posts He might interpret too many likes as an interest in him Retweet or share only what you think is really important Turn off your chat function to avoid lengthy conversations Sometimes guys misinterpret civility for attraction or flirtation If this happens avoid him to the fullest extent Unfollow him on social media Block his phone number Casually turn in the opposite direction if you see him coming your way This should give him a clear message  If he refuses to leave you alone tell someone This could be your parents a trusted teacher or guidance counselor a school security guard or a police officer Dont let him make you feel unsafe for feelings you have no control over
Ask people if it looks good on you to boost your ego Make sure your hair looks good as well Feeling good about your appearance will give you confidence  Thats the first thing you have to do Breathe deeply talking to him is no big deal You both attend the same school or wherever and assuming it you can talk to him if you want to Make sure that you and your crush are both at a relaxed social occasion This could be a party a sports event or the mall This lends a feeling of casualness to your interaction   If he is in the middle of a conversation with other friends wait for him to split off on his own or wait to make eye contact with the group and say hello to everyone at once   When you get your crush alone attempt to sound as casual as you can Casual comes off as confident and confidence can be faked Even if you dont feel confident act like it If you dont know him yet a good way to start a conversation is paying a compliment on his shirt and then when you see him again ask his name and introduce yourself But if you both already met each other just start a conversation anyway   When he answers make sure you seem interested and react truthfully   Mention a similar story of your own or comment on what he just said During this time use your instincts to feel out if your crush is interested in you not necessarily if they like you as much as you like them Pay attention to how engaged they are and how they try to steer the conversation   Ask about his favorite movies what he likes doing Show youre interested   This way he will enjoy being with you even more   Once you have reasonably assessed that your crush likes you bring up an event that relates to what you have been talking about such as a play movie or sports event Mention that you will be attending Tell your crush that you would love it if they would go with you This makes it less of a question and more of an invitation to something you are already planning on attending   If you want to ask him out you dont need to be nervous A girl can do it Just dont make it sound so big like a date make it sound like something two friends do together For example you can go up to him and say hey theres this really cool movie going on in the theater wanna come with me Act naturally and friendly If your crush says yes get his number and tell him you will call him about the details soon This doesnt have to be the end of the conversation but your main goal has been accomplished Congrats If he says no figure out why Possibly he is just busy that day or perhaps he is not interested in a date with you Use your instincts to feel it out If you are unsure its best to leave it at Well if you ever want to go to a movie sports event let me know I would love to go with you Then the ball is in his court If you are planning to ask him on a date then bring up something like Hey would you like to catch a movie this Friday night Be confident and comfortable Do not be offended if he rejects your invite Just go Ok Then change the subject If you are rejected dont take it personally It is alright There are always more fish in the sea

Is the boy popular A nerd An introvert You should find out what hes like so that you can choose your words and ideas accordingly You wouldnt want to write the wrong thing to him and he probably wouldnt forget it easily if you did  You could investigate what type of boy he is by walking casually pass by him and overhearing conversations But dont appear stalkerish that can scare boys off entirely  Make sure to address him by his first name or his nickname Last names are too formal for a love letter Dont use names like cutie or he might freak out Cutie makes it seem like you are literally obsessed with him which can seem frightening   Make sure to talk about both him and you equally You dont want to come off as egotistic by talking about your own life too much But still pour out your feelings towards him Dont forget to introduce yourself a little bit because he probably doesnt know you Most importantly be yourself It would be awful if he loved you for who he thought you were not who you really were   Every guy loves to see that the person who is writing them is intelligent and careful You could ask someone you trust very deeply to help you out with your spelling and grammar   If you wish to remain anonymous leave your name out whilst hinting him at who you are Dont sign it anything out of place or too girly because he might just as well freak out For instance do not say Be mine forever or I love you A simple love will do   Pick a picture that you think represents who you are well This is optional as you might not want to reveal yourself too early If you do not want to reveal yourself consider drawing painting or writing something for him If this is not ideal for you maybe give him a picture of something that represents you for instance cats if you really like cats   If you dont know what his locker number is you could also investigate by casually looking around to see where his position when using his locker usually is Dont ask his friends because they will probably straight out tell him that some girl was curious about his locker number Neither should you ask your friend because they might go annoy or tease you about it   Dont talk too much to him you will have plenty of time for that later If you want to hear his reaction but dont want to be seen you can round a corner and hide there to listen but that might seem a bit creepy
Engage in a simple exchange of pleasantries A simple âhelloâ or âhiâ will do as a greeting A âHow are youâ or âWhatâs upâ is even better The bottom line in this step is to break the ice and get the conversation rolling How she greets you will be the beginning of telling you if sheâs interested or not   If you quickly run out of things to say and the conversation becomes stale consider telling a funny story or developing a funny routine Consider telling a quick selfdeprecating joke to show you dont take yourself very seriouslyLaughter is a great way to break the ice Keep it simple but make her laugh and appeal to her sense of humor Be sure not to turn the conversation into a standup routine and give her a chance to respond  After youâve started a conversation donât hesitate to jump into asking questions Find out more about the girl and move on from there The depth at which she responds will show you in how she feels about you If she responds more shes very into the current conversation and who knows very into the person shes talking to you   Ask her what her hobbies are what sort of music she likes and what movies she is into Does she enjoy reading You may find out that she does and use it as a jumping off point to move into more intimate territory How much she tells you may give keen insight into how she feels about you Itâs important to keep the questions casual If you ask questions that are a little too personal it may make her feel creeped out or uncomfortable around you This is the last thing you want when trying to figure out if sheâs into you There are plenty of questions to ask without stepping over the line Donât be afraid to flirt Itâs one of the easiest ways to let someone know youâre enjoying your time together and get a similar response Be sure to smile initiate casual contact like a touch on the arm and maintain eye contact All of these go a long way in letting someone know you like them Who knows â she may return the flirtation and give you the answers youâre seeking   Eye contact is the most important forms of communication It communicates respect understanding appreciation and most importantly interest Eye contact can also make the difference between seeming aloof and blossoming a friendship or more After youâve reached a level of conversation and become comfortable with one another ask deeper questions Find out what her passions are If sheâs willing to share them with you thereâs probably a level of interest After all sheâs opening up about topics that make her who she is In other words this is privileged information â the conversation has moved on from casual to real and memorable for both parties involved   Ask questions about her friends her fears her loves and her quirks If youâre feeling extra bold ask about her past â just be sure to steer clear of conversations about past relationships You donât want to know how she feels about an ex you want to know how she feels about you How much she shares will tell you how interested she is in sharing with you The more she shares the more interested she is You may also ask about her hobbies and some other good questions which would make her feel that you are interested in her as much as she is into you
If this is the first time youre using this bit on this particular horse you should be sure that youre using a proper sized bridle If its the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortableBridles comes in three sizes pony cob or Arabian and full Measure your horseâs head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mouth and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle If the bit is too small it can pinch the horseâs mouth If the bit is too large it will slide around in the horseâs mouth Also an oversized ported or jointed bit can cause pain or damage to the roof of the horses mouth  Let the noseband hang This gives you something to keep the horse in check but wont get in the way of the bridle Do not have the horse tied when you do this Pick it up from its crownpiece top part in your left hand letting the rest of it hang Move any small straps to the outside of the cheekpieces so they wont get tangled   Now hold it in your right hand  Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apart with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps Make sure you take up all the reins so that you donât create loops for your horse to step in and keep all the straps off the ground   Once he does hold the bit in the palm of your left hand with your right forearm paralleling the horses top of his neck your hand should be right near his ears Gently press the bit next to the horses teeth and insert your thumb back into the horses mouth to make it open if you must  If your horse wont lower his head or accept the bit offer them a treat while offering the bit Hold the bridle in your right arm with the crown of it near the horses ears and rest its bit and a treat a bit of apple or sugar cube in your palm Slip the bit into your horseâs mouth with the treat Hold the bit low where youâve been holding the treats Gently set it against your horseâs teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible Hold your sugar cube against the bit Make sure that youâre holding the crown up and ready to slip on before you put the bit in their mouth Make sure you have the bit in before you put the bridleâs crown over their ears   You want to maintain gentle pressure on the bit so the horse doesnt let it out of his mouth Avoid crushing the horses ears It you have to slip one ear under the crown and then the other do so gently   Give your horse a treat to reward them for being good This is optional and probably not needed for a calm experienced horse   The brow band should always rest against your horses forehead smoothly It should be set 12 below the base of the horses ears Check from the front to make sure its straight and isnt pinching the horses ears   While youre adjusting the brow band adjust the headstall and cheek pieces to make sure everything is straight Double check by looking at the bridle headon   The throatlatch isnt there to hold the bridle in place and should be buckled with enough slack for 4 fingers to slide between it and the horses neck The throatlatch operates as an extra precaution to prevent the bridle from falling off This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slack even if the horse drops his head   Make sure you can fit 4 fingers between the throatlatch and the horse even when their head is bent downwards To remember about how loose the throatlatch should be imagine it as a necklace   The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position so it wont be pinching your horses ears or head Check that the bit sits evenly in your horses mouth There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horses mouth Too few wrinkles and you need to shorten the cheek straps   Make sure it sits evenly on your horseâs head If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even   Unsnap the halter from the remaining crosstie Untie the lead rope from your horses neck and unbuckle and remove the halter   This is when you should check the length of your reins The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horses mouth   Lead them on their left at their cheek Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit   Keep the bight in your left hand
If you want to make contact with a girl you like first try and relax your body You want to make sure you dont communicate nervousness or defensiveness as this may put a girl on edge Try to stay calm going into the conversationIf youre nervous you may lean forward and dip your chin down slightly This can make you look aggressive Try to be aware of your posture Make sure your chin is straight and level Keep your hands and arms loose at your side or put your hands in your pocket This will help make you look relaxed and nonchalant This will make you look approachable  Another good way to initiate contact is eye contact Eye contact can help convey interest and allow you to initiate a conversation If youre interested in getting to know a girl from your class try starting off with eye contact Try to catch a girls eye and hold her gaze for a few moments before looking awayHowever be careful not to stare This can come off as creepy Try to make and hold hold eye contact briefly If a girl is not returning your eye contact after a few seconds look away and try again You do not want it to look like youre staring   A calm and friendly smile is a great way to grab someones attention Once youve made eye contact try smiling Try to think about something that genuinely makes you happy when youre smiling You want your smile to look real and genuine as a fake smile can easily give you away Once youve gotten a girls attention you should make an effort to make conversation It can be stressful to make conversation with someone you dont know but with a quick observation or introduction you should be able to start a conversationStart by introducing yourself You can simply say something like Hi Im Paul It may feel a little awkward but if this is someone you see in class a lot its perfectly acceptable to introduce yourself Try to open with an observation When youre in school theres a lot to observe and comment on You could talk about the upcoming test or make an observation about what happened in class today Try to give the girl the opportunity to share by posing an observation as a question For example dont just say Wow that was a crazy test last week Instead say Wow that was a crazy test last week right This invites the girl to share her opinion as well   During the average school day it may be hard to stop and make conversation with a girl However if you join some extracurriculars you may find its easier to find people with common interests Extracurriculars also provide you with the opportunity to socialize and make friends This can help you meet girlsFind an after school club that caters to your interests and includes members of both genders Youre unlikely to meet girls on a boys sports team However something like the school newspaper may help The advantage of meeting people through a club is that youll automatically have something in common If you sometimes struggle to make conversation youll have something to discuss right away   One of the easiest ways to establish a connection to someone else is through another person Its easier to feel close and relaxed around someone if you meet in a casual social setting If you have any friends who are close to girls in your school mention you would like to try to meet some girls See if that friend can invite you to parties and events where his female friends will be present In order to get to know someone you need to share your thoughts and feelings with that person Long talks in which you communicate openly are what foster the closeness that forms a friendship and possibly a romantic relationship down the roadIt may take time to get to the place where youre sharing feelings with a girl in your school so be patient You may have to spend some time socializing with her outside of school or at an after school club before the two of you feel close enough to open up to one another Be patient and let things happen organically You cannot force intimacy As you get to know someone youll find you begin sharing things naturally as you feel more comfortable with one another The girl may mention her family share her opinion on a social issue or tell you how shes feeling on a given day Try to listen genuinely to what she says and share your own emotions in turn   Social media can be a great way to get to know someone especially if you tend to be shy Many people meet in real life and then strengthen that existing bond on social media Once youve gotten to know girls in your school a little add them on Facebook Twitter and other social media outlets You can comment on a girls Facebook post and talk to her through the messenger feature Many people feel more relaxed talking online and if youve established a bond online it may make facetoface communication feel easier   Keep in mind however not to overdo it If you pester a girl too much on social media she may get annoyed Do not for example like all her statuses or comment on all her posts Use discretion   Asking questions is a great way to promote the flow of a conversation They help the conversation move forward and show that youre genuinely interested in what the speaker has to say When talking to girls in your school ask a lot of questions to get to know them betterAsk general questions to start a conversation For example you can ask something like How was your day or How did you do on that last test As the conversation continues ask questions about the topic at hand For example if the girl mentions her family is getting a new puppy dont just say Oh thats cool Instead ask about this Say something like What breed Are you getting him from the shelter or a breeder   After youve talked to a girl a bit and know her somewhat try inviting her to hang out You can invite her to hang out in a group with you and your friends However you can also ask her to hang out with you oneonone   If you want to go on a date ask the girl to go somewhere with just you that feels datelike You could ask her to go see a movie to get dinner or to grab coffee You can also invite a girl to a social outing with your friends This can be a great way to get to know a girl as a friend You can also expand your friends group by introducing a new member   It can be hard to get to know people if youre shy If social situations make you nervous there are ways you can overcome shyness It may sound strange but rehearsing what you want to say ahead of time may actually helpIf you have to talk to a girl on the phone or you know youll see her in class try writing down what you want to say Obviously you cannot plan out a whole conversation but try jotting down what you want to talk about Try to rehearse these words out loud in front of a mirror When you end up talking to the girl the conversation may not play out exactly as you planned However you may be less nervous as you have some kind of a plan   It can also help to write down conversation starters If youre going on a date or getting together with the girl socially conversation starters can be particularly helpful Jot down things you could use to start conversations such as observations I cant believe its still snowing in March complements Thats a great jacket on you and questions Do you know what time the assembly is today It may sound silly but many people choke in the moment and fail to start a conversation Having a plan can help For many shyness can be very difficult to overcome It can help to talk out your issues with shyness with friends and family members They may offer support advice and insight on how to cope with shynessChoose people you feel will listen without judgment Putdowns and lectures are unlikely to be helpful so dont talk to people who like to give unsolicited advice Select people who will listen and try to understand without trying to dismiss your shyness   Talking to girls in your school can be very intimidating Many high school students are shy around girls It may help to practice socializing in other places Make conversation with boys in your class make small talk with a clerk at the drugstore call a family member who lives far away Practice socializing in situations where youre less likely to feel nervous This can help you relax more when talking to a girl
Some people prefer to put a halter on over the bridle Others prefer to hook the halter around the horses neck Others prefer to remove the bridle without tying up the horse its recommended not to do that unless the horse is to be crosstied in his stall or in an aisle with others present  If the horse attempts to move it is possible to hold the reins here in order to keep the horse still     If you tied the halter around the horses neck now would be the time to remove the halter from his neck and place it properly on his head   Do not let the girth fall down and hit the horses legs instead lower it gently   Scoop the girth up lie it across the saddle and place the saddle somewhere safe
The next time youre around each guy make an effort to really engage him and to think about what it is you like about him so much Though you cant always pin down the complicated feelings that make you like a person its important to have as much information as possible when you make such an important decision Ask yourself the following questions when you talk to each guy   Does he make me laugh Does he have a good sense of humor Were all attracted to people who can make us laugh Guys with a good sense of humor make us excited and cause us to look at the world in a different way If he tickles you is it weird or do you like it No guy should touch you in the obvious places unless you are ready for that but like a hug around the waist holding hands or even his arm around you is okay but if youre at the stage where he is going to kiss you and you kiss him back make sure that you are ready to be at that stage When he kisses you be sure you know how to kiss You dont want it to be awkward The guy you are going to choose needs to be able to restrain himself Does he seem curious about other people Is he interested in things outside himself Guys who are only interested in themselves can be pretty boring Youll want a guy who has hobbies friends and a good perspective on life Is he in touch with his emotional side Is he sensitive about other people Lots of guys have an emotional side the problem is they dont want other people to see it A guy whos okay with other people seeing his emotions is a guy whos both confident and mature Does he flirt respectfully Basically the ask question boils down to this Does it seem like he likes you for more than just your body or just your looks Are the compliments he gives you more than just about your body Does he take things slow Guys who take things slow like to savor things They care about getting every last drop of enjoyment out of being around you Guys who are moving at the speed of light are often onto the next girl faster than you can say letdown  This is just as important as thinking about what you like about each guy One guy may look better on paper and may have all of the qualities that youre looking for but the other guy may have the ability to make your heart pound just by sending you a text message So the next time youre around each guy think not only about why you like him but ask yourself if he makes you feel confident happy giddy and like a better person Here are some things to consider   How does he make you feel when youre around him Does he make you feel like hes only interested in you or does he seem like he flirts with other girls all the time and youre just another girl on his long list Does he bring out the best in you or is he okay with you just being okay Does he challenge you and make you want to be a better person Does he compliment you in a way that is meaningful and not forced Does he make you blush giggle and feel like a giddy little girl Does he treat you like a lady and make you feel special   Though you may only be thinking about all of the great qualities of both guys and about how they both give you butterflies you should also consider the negative aspects of their personality or lifestyle to get more clarification If youre serious about making this choice then you have to consider the pros and the cons of being with each guy Here are some things to consider as you make your decision   Does the guy have a lot of baggage Does he have a complicated past and a slew of emotional issues to deal with Sure you may have fun with him but is that something you want to be responsible for in the long run Is he bossy and manipulative Does he always try to get his way or is he incapable of admitting hes wrong These are serious signs that hes probably a little selfish and signs that you might get more than you bargained for in a relationship Has he lied to you You want a guy that you can trust a guy whos not afraid to be honest with you regardless of how much the truth hurts Guys who like gossiping and starting rumors probably dont care much about other people meaning stay away from him Does he constantly get in trouble either at school with his parents or with the authorities Bad boys may have a certain sexiness about them but chances are if theyre constantly distracted with shenanigans or hijinks they wont have any time to be around you Does he still talk about his exgirlfriend If hes still talking about his ex dropping in little hints from time to time or constantly talking about her thats a bad sign It doesnt mean that hes a bad guy it just means that he still loves her   If both guys are completely devoted to you then you have a tough task on your hands Though you shouldnt go with the guy who likes you more just because its a safer choice you should consider how important you are to each guy and what it would mean to him if you stopped seeing him If he would just shrug it off and then move on to the next girl then hes not the guy for you If you think one of the guys likes you much more than the other then this should play a strong part in your decision   You dont have to ask outright You can get a sense of how much guy feels about you just by the way he looks at you by how often he wants to hang out and by how much he talks about a future together Of course if youre just looking to have fun with a summer fling or to get some dating experience for a few months then you dont have to care so much about whether the guy sees you as long term potential   Your friends are there for a reason they offer shoulders to lean on provide examples of how to behave and give you advice when you need it Take their advice but with a grain of salt Youre making the decision at the end of the day Remember that youre not asking them to help you pick the better guy or the guy that they would pick but that you want them to help you decide whats right for you   Dont ask Who do you like better Ask Who do you think is better for me These questions will keep you from getting suggestions about who your friends would date instead of who you should date Be open to their suggestions If you have your mind made up about who you want to date theres no use in asking your friends about their opinion If you ask them for their input be ready to follow it   This will help you see what you really wanted in the first place How does each one make you feel Make a list of what you really want in a guy and dont Do a procons chart about each guys strengths and weaknesses See how this procons chart lines up with the list of what you want out of a guy Here are some other questions you can ask   Which guy will treat me better Which guy will be there for me through the tough times Which guy do I have more in common with Which guys face will I always want to see at the end of the day Which guy will get along better with my friends and family Which guy can I not live without   We cant pick and choose who we like Were born a certain way and we eventually develop likes and dislikes Dont overthink things Trust what your gut tells you about these guys and go for it Flip a coin in the air Tell yourself that if it lands on heads you have to go with Guy A and if it lands on tails you have to go with Guy B While the coin is in the air where do you instinctively want it to land Thats your answer   If you know one guy is bad for you but cant help feeling attracted to him and dont really like the other guy take a break from both guys Not being in a relationship really isnt bad In fact its much better than being burned Learn from your mistakes If youve dated a certain guy before and the relationship ended poorly dont make the same mistake all over again with another guy Even if you feel attracted to him whats the use in going through the same thing all over again if it caused you heartbreak and misery   Dont feel like you need to make a decision right away Your decision could take some time During that time hopefully one of the guys will do something good or bad to make the decision much easier for you As long as you havent committed to either guy and dont feel like youre being disloyal to one guy by hanging out with the other then you should take some time to make the decision   Just dont drag it on too long If you pick one guy but he finds out that youve been hanging out with another guy for the last few months then he may feel hurt or slighted   Once youve made your decision stick to it That doesnt mean you have to tell the guy Hey I chose you over Guy A That wont make the guy feel very special The commitment is something you make through your actions and your heart Work on building a healthy stable relationship with the guy youve chosen  and only the guy youve chosen   Get ready to start dating and hanging out with only the guy youve chosen Enjoy the benefits of being with one person without wondering what another guy is up to If you feel empty or incomplete without the other guy then it may either mean that you made the wrong decision or that you never liked the first guy that much in the first place  you only liked the chase Be friendly to the other guy but dont go out of your way to hang out with him or do stuff alone together If youre overly friendly with him he might think that he still has a chance Plus it might get the guy you chose unnecessarily jealous   Know that choosing between two guys will affect your relationship with both of them This is the doubleedged sword of relationships chances are good that youre going to break the other guys heart and miss out on a relationship with him If the guy you dont choose doesnt know about the first guy you dont have to make it a big deal or give him the real reason why youre ending your relationship Though you should be happy once youve made your decision know that the seas may still be a bit rocky   Know that you may turn guys against each other What if both guys are best friends What do you do then If you choose one and the other likes you theyll probably stop being best friends If you want to avoid this situation altogether date someone else instead Be prepared to lose the guy that you didnt choose He may not want to be just friends after you hung out romantically or flirted with each other But that may be for the best   Life is yours to live and you deserve to live it the way you want  while trying to hurt others as little as possible Though you may feel guilty for making the decision you and the two guys are better off once youve come to terms with your feelings Be proud of yourself for making a mature choice instead of leading two guys on forever   Dont be afraid of making mistakes as long as you learn from them Dont worry about having everyone like you when youre making a big decision like this feelings will get hurt

If you donât absolutely know that he likes you donât act upon it You may ruin a friendship based on rumors that other people have told you or an assumption that youâve made because you think he likes you There are some telltale signs that he is truly into youHe consistently asks you out He persistently tries for body contact He persists on hanging oneonone  The longer you wait the worse itâll be His feelings will grow and it will be impossible to maintain any kind of friendship after you tell him the truth You can pretend all you want that heâll âget the hintâ if you simply avoid him Well he wonât You need to find a time to talk to him Make it a time when itâs only the two of you so that he doesnât get embarrassed in front of a group of people   Write down what youâre going to say before you say it If you fumble over your words youâll make the conversation longer more awkward and a worse time than it needs to be In your plan you should have some points about why you arenât interested in him Donât attack him with reasons heâs grossâjust be honest about why youâre not into himYou canât seem to move on from your exboyfriend You just arenât physically attracted to him You like someone else   If you have a conversation on the phone or over text you can still implement all of these into your conversation The most important part when doing that is being ultimate Make sure he knows that there is no future chance for the relationship   You need to let him know that you want to have a serious conversation This way he takes what youâre saying to heart If you donât take the time to do this he may not understand the level of importance of the talk Let him down easy Add a compliment or two into your talk but convey to him that itâs not enough   âYouâre a great friend but we canât be togetherâ âYouâll make someone very happy but itâs not going to be meâ   Even after giving him the reasons youâre not into him he may not fully understand Deliver your official âbackoffâ message after youâve told him your reasons   âWe wonât have a romantic relationshipâ âWe can stay friends if youâre going to keep it at friendshipâ âThere isnât the right chemistry between usâ   If you donât tell him flat out that youâre feelings arenât going to changeâhe might hope for it Donât let him leave with any questions of you having romantic feelings for him in the future Set some ground rules for your friendship if there is still going to be one Let him ask some questions if he wants to and answer the honestly Thereâs no sense in protecting his feelings with lies tell him the truth This will help him move on more quickly Rehearsing the conversation in your head helps but can also hurt you by creating preconceptions in your head about how it will go Rather than attacking him with your thoughts sit across from him and hear what he has to say so that he will listen to what you have to say To ensure that heâs gotten your point fully ask him what he thinks about it all Stand your ground and donât leave the conversation without him understanding that you donât like him Donât leave without clarity Just because you told him that you donât like him doesnât mean you have to ignore him or be rude Donât think of him as weak or broken because of your choice Heâll move past it so treat him like a human being Dont just ignore him forever Donât go out of your way to see if heâs doing alright If you run into him be cordial but donât reach out to him outside of that Rejection hurts and if youâre constantly reminding him about it heâll constantly be hurting This could eventually lead to selfesteem issues anger or even aggressionâyou donât want to be at fault for that If he decides that he can stay friends with you after having the conversation make sure to set a clear line of appropriateness This can be in a separate discussion if either of you need time to think about it Having this discussion will help both of you put some closure on the previous one   Discuss if itâs ok to comment on how one another looks Talk about if physical contact hugs holding hands etc is still appropriate

Avoid sticking your fingers through the bars of the cage If your guinea pig feels threatened it will lash out and your fingers will be the perfect target Donât give it the chance to do any damage  You will inevitably come into contact with your guinea pig Wash your hands to get rid of any odors that the guinea pig may not like such as dog and cat scents Guinea pigs have a keen sense of smell and an instinctual fear of scents they associate with danger Since cats and dogs can pose a threat they might react negatively to those smellsOn the off chance that your guinea pig has an insatiable appetite make sure that you wash your hands to remove any food odors You donât want your guinea pig to confuse your fingers for their meal You might consider wearing gloves until you are confident that your guinea pig wonât bite you   Biting results primarily from fear but there are several other biological and environmental reasons for such behavior   Pain can cause biting You might be hurting the guinea pig or there might be a deeper physiological issueSometimes guinea pigs will bite you when they mean to nibble on themselves This can be an indicator of mites or fleas If discomfort or pain is a concern contact your veterinarian for an exam right away If your pig is nibblingbiting while you are holding it it may need to get down to urinate So if that is the case put it back in the cage and watch what it does next If the pig urinates you have your answerNonneutered male guinea pigs may show dominance by biting more than females or neutered male guinea pigs Consider neutering your guinea pig However there is no guarantee that neutering will stop the biting completelyDominance is not solely based on testosterone levelsIf your guinea pig is biting the bars of its cage it could mean that the animal is lonely and wants attention It might not be exhibiting menacing behavior but calling out for attention Approach carefully
This requires courage but its a surefire way for him to at least know that you exist If hes new to the neighborhood go over and say a quick hello Introduce yourself and welcome him to the neighborhood Tell him where you live ie Hi Im Miranda I just live in the house across the street I just thought Id stop by and welcome you to the neighborhood  When he is outside go outside at the same time Make sure that youre not just standing there staring at him youll need a reason to be outside such as doing yard work washing the car playing etc so it seems like a coincidence that youre outside at the same time The last thing you want is for him to think that youre a creepy stalker   Give him a reason to  play with a friendsibling play a very loud game listen to your favorite song and sing along if youre confident enough etc Doing this will make him start to notice you   If you walk by his house and see him or vice versa be sure to say something You dont have to get into a huge conversation a simple Hi Good morning or Good afternoon will do the trick Once he gets used to you greeting him he will be the one saying hello first   After a while begin to actually talk to him Saying things like How are you Whats up Hey neighbor etc will give him the opportunity to talk to you more so you can learn more about him This will help you two get closer   Once hes really started to notice you feel free to look over at him If he catches you instead of looking away smile and wave at him Hell most likely smile and wave back   Once hes noticed you hell probably initiate a conversation or two When this happens be cool Talk to him like you would any normal person You dont want to freak him out right
Use their name in the note so they can be sure that the note is for them If you donât include their name they might think the note was intended for someone else In the end your note wonât have its intended effect  Start off by writing it like a letter for instance âDear Sallyâ Write them a message and include their name in the message  Start a note off by letting them know how much you admire them In addition you could comment about one their great qualities â qualities that make you want to be around them Consider   Letting them know how smart you think they are Telling them how you think they are handsome or beautiful Stating how you think they are funny and witty If youâre artistically inclined you could write a short and sweet poem or draw a picture for your crush Ultimately a poem or a picture could send a sweet message and let them know that they are in your thoughts  Draw a picture of them Write a poem about the things you like about them   Donât tell them that you are headoverheels for them and would do anything to be with them Instead let them know that you are a sure and confident person and would really like to get to know them better  Write something like âOut of all of the people I know you seem like someone I really should spend more time withâ The worst thing you can do is to leave your crush a note that leaves them with the impression that you are obsessed with them or are stalking them If you do this youâll likely alienate the person insult them or scare them  Avoid stating how much you love them Donât say that you think about them constantly Never write inappropriate sexual things This will likely be seen as harassment and could get you into trouble Tape or simply leave the note on their desk or locker You should be able to easily place a note on their desk when youâre coming into a classroom or leaving one You can also tape the note onto or slide it into their locker as youâre walking by itIf youre not a student you should avoid leaving romantic notes on a colleagues desk In addition consider avoiding flirtations during office hours  this could be taken as sexual harassment   If your crush looks forward to your notes one of the best things for you to do would be to leave notes randomly in places you know theyâll be This way theyâll be surprised whenever they see the note  If you know your crush sits at a certain place at lunch think about leaving the note there Leave it on their car windshield   Never trespass or open your crushâs locker car bookbag purse or anything else private to leave your note By violating your crushâs personal space youâll send the message that you donât respect them or are way too aggressive In the end you may wind up alienating them rather than winning their affection  Avoid leaving a note in their mailbox on their front door or at their home They may think you are stalking them Dont follow your crush from work or school to give them a note   Ultimately while you may leave some âsecret admirerâ notes you donât want to go too long leaving notes without letting them know who you are Whether it be in your first note second note or a few notes later you need to give them an idea of who you are You can do this in several ways   Simply write your name at the bottom of the note Give them some sort of clue about who you are Approach them later and tell them youâre their special note writer The best way to take your relationship to the next level is to start to hand them notes directly This is especially true if you know theyre receptive to your flirtations In the end they might hand you a note back After youve left a few notes you should ask them if theyâd like to do something with you Ultimately going on a date â or just hanging out â is the next logical step in your evolving relationship Suggest   Going to the movies Taking a walk after school Getting a bite to eat together   If you get the sense that the person doesnât really welcome your notes you should stop immediately You might be able to sense this from how they look when they get a note from the comments they make about it to other people or you can ask a friend to inquire about it Ultimately if they arenât interested in the notes you should stop immediately
Ask him straight forward what he looks for in a girl This will give you a better idea of the kind of things that he is or isnât attracted to Take note about if you have these qualities or not Not only should you ask what he likes but also ask what he doesnât like Keep it casual but pick at his brain for his biggest turnons and turnoffs   If he says that heâs ânot sure how he feelsâ thatâs not a good sign Chances are he knows but he knows you wonât respond well if he tells youIf he says that he thinks that you have a great personality ask him if he finds you attractive   Have a talk about what you mean to each other Make sure not to bring it up in front of a group That might make him uncomfortable and he might not give very straight answers to avoid an awkward situation
If you want that special guy to start noticing you youre going to have to put yourself out there Its hard but its worth it Look your best work that smile be friendly and be yourselfâhell start wishing he knew you in no time    Dress to impress If youre that kind of girl wear a floral dress when its hot out or a cute black sweater when its cold Wear clothes that accent your features Get a friends advice on what looks good on you or ask your parents You want him to notice how well dressed you are every time he sees you Dont dress in something you will not feel comfortable in Dress the way you want to but make sure that you at least look cute If your school has a uniform wear a color or style that looks good on you  Be clean and have good hygiene Shower at least once a day For example if you practice on a soccer team or exert yourself after school be sure to shower afterwards to get all that sweat off of you Wash your face in the morning and at night you dont want pimples to attack your pretty face Also dont forget to brush your teeth You only get one set of adult teeth Look after them because bad breath can really push him away and everyone else too  Smile Smile when you talk to him or when hes around Smiling lets him know that he makes you happy Glance at him during class if you happen to lock eyes smile and hold his gaze without blinking for as long as possible Let him digest the fact that youre thinking about him and then look away like nothing has ever happened Dont overdo it thoughâthat shouldnt be done more than once a day  Its not really necessary and lots of guys like natural anyway so go for a natural look when it comes to makeup If you feel like you have to use makeup be subtle with it Dont go overboard because that will make him not like you    Wear minimal makeup Makeup is not for covering up your best features but making them pop Consider going for the natural look too Some guys just want to see your face not your makeup Too much makeup can lead to teasing and not the flirty type If you really want to wear makeup just use some lip balm foundation and even mascara if you like If you wear makeup keep it simple because cake faces are a real turn off Play around with your hairstyle Be yourself dont ever decide how you want your hair to look just for some boy Consider trimming your bangs straightening or curling your hair if you think it suits you Alternatively play with wearing your hair or makeup in a different way one day   Act casual but be yourself If youre having trouble pretend like you dont have a crush on him and that hes just another person That gets rid of the tension that can make a conversation awkward Practice on other boys like his friends Get his number so you can text which is a lot easier   Talk about friends in your class something strange that happened to you or a social event you both plan on attending If youre having trouble keeping the conversation going be sure to ask him lots of questions Not so much because he might get annoyed  Make good eye contact with him throughout Your eyes are the window into your soul and definitely one of the most attractive parts of your body Make sure he sees them Focusing your eyes on him will tell him hes got your undivided attention But dont stare at him all the time this will make him think youre creepy Look into his eyes when he talks to you if you look at his feet you dont look confident Laugh at his jokes Doing so will make him feel appreciated That being said dont force yourself to laugh because it will sound fake If its a joke indicated at you make a subtle one back at him Its all playful   Dont make fun of him but joking around is okay Play around with him and if you want to get flirty ask him to arm wrestle you That way you could hold his hand and it wont seem weird or awkward   Some people dont like being touched as much as others Making physical contact with your crush is important because it tells him you like getting close to him Subtle is best here you dont want to claw at him and invade his personal space Give him hugs when you see him   Gently touch his arm or bump your knee against his Rub shoulders with him when you ask him to explain that science problem you both had for homework School related work is the best to get intouch with someone its a perfect excuse When he tells a funny joke or teases you in a flirty way lightly hit him on the shoulder Your body language is telling him that you actually enjoy his attention If youre really brave let your hand crawl up his arm onto his shoulder or play footsie with him you can also sit on his desk before class starts Also blow him kisses in a playful way Tickling is also a great way of flirting Because a lot of guys dont like being tickled however you would be better off at the receiving end Mention being ticklish and make your ticklish spots vulnerable Its good to start with a spot like your feet and build up to being touched on the ribs and sides You would let him tickle you Play with his hair Dont overdo it though or it will look strange and he will want to stay away from you   Boys his age are easily influenced by their friends so if youre friends with his friends hell realize that youre cool If youre part of the same group the two of you can hang out more often without feeling awkward Make sure you dont become one of the bros because boys dont date their best friends   If you feel uncomfortable around his friends thats fine Dont avoid them or leave when you see them coming Use your siblings If both your siblings are close in age you automatically have something to talk about Even better if his siblings and your siblings are friends suggest that the two of you take your siblings to the movies or amusement park together   Talk to him about his interests his family music tastes etc Find out if any of his interests and your interests overlap   Dont forget to actually listen Bring up details he said later on in conversation to prove that youre a good listener Dont overdo this or youll seem like a stalker Try to find things you have in common Do you both play guitar or love the same bands Suggest that you jam together Do you both play sports Ask him to play a pickup game sometime   It may take a bit of practice to know what makes him click but stick with it Take the things that he likes to do and be sure to make an appearance   Does he do sports Go to his games or tournaments and cheer him on Ask him when its going to be and wish him luck if you cant come See if he tries to spot you in the stands Encourage him when he is down All guys have some down moments so cheer him up Showing him that you care will make him more likely to care about you Do not say another boy is hot or go on about someone else He might think you like the other boy and not him If you like multiple boys at the same time decide on which boy which you want to pursue and only go after him Or have a lot of friends and dont focus on one boy Its not like you are going to get married Its fun to have a lot of friends and not have to worry about treating anyone one of them differently because you dont like them all the same If your crush finds out that you like two guys at the same time he might not feel that he was special in your mind   If theres a subject you excel at and hes struggling with offer to help him If the opposite is true ask him for help This will lead to more oneonone time and an overall better relationship with him   You probably already know this but dont plan on getting a lot of work done during these study sessions Your attention is going to be spent elsewhere and thats okay Just prepare for your exam a day or two ahead if you can   There are a couple different ways for you to tell whether a boy likes you or not Here are some tricks to find out without coming out and asking him   Ask him to carry your backpack to class Tell him its heavy and he looks strong enough to carry it easily If he says yes it probably means that he likes you enough to do favors for you and likes that you think hes strong If you want to tell one of your friends something when hes there tell him to close his ears or to step back a little This will make him want to hear whats going on even more and youll know that he cares   Be sure he does not already have a girlfriend Double check to make sure that none of your friends like him You dont want to stir up a lot of drama with your friends because you might lose a friend and scare your crush away   If one of your friends does like him you should discuss who gets him If you cant come to a fair agreement such as who liked him first he chooses etc both of you should move on If you decide to let your friend go after him and they get together dont hold it against her Stay friends with her Be happy for them and realize that there will be plenty of other boys in your future   If you dont get the person you like dont get sad Be confident in who you are deep down inside and love yourself from the inside out   Sometimes after a boy realizes you like them that way they start to see you in a different light Even if he says no he may start to subconsciously think about the characteristics that he likes about you or why you would make a good girlfriend Shy boys dont always have the courage to tell other people how they really feel or they dont know how to If you like a shy boy and he doesnt seem interested it could be because he gets nervous around you and doesnt know what to do If he is shy keep trying to make him feel comfortable around you Definitely hang out with him in places where he is most comfortable   Its definitely tough being a middleschooler but youre beginning to learn how to balance out all the work and drama in your life Dont be too overcommitted or you wont have time to hang out with him and remember that theres more to life than middle school and it wont be long before youre not even sure what you ever saw in that boy   If he feels he cant keep up with you he might get too nervous and think that youre out of his league If you are very socially active invite him to come along one day with you and some of your friends This will give him a chance to be around you outside of school and in your natural state Dont make him feel like youre never around If you bring him along make sure he feels comfortable Likewise dont undercommit or you could seem like a loser You want to surround your life with interesting activities and friends regardless of whether he likes you If he does like you your life just got that much better If he doesnt like you your life is fun and meaningful without him   This means being comfortable in your own skin doing what you want to do and saying what you want to say The people who dont love and respect you for who you are truly arent worth fighting for   Dont try to be somebody youre not Hell like you just the way you are You may even have some things in common   Let him know youre interested but not desperate If youre not sure where hes at be careful about following these steps they might not turn out the way you had hoped   Ask him Hey would you like to hang out with me sometime If he says yes youve done your part Smile and tell him you have to go Then walk away without looking back Now the ball is in his court Suggest going to the movies or a school sports game together Asking him to the movies would be a little more formal of a date but you could also suggest going with friends Asking him to a school sports game doesnt have to be a date It could just be you two hanging out Ask him out to Sadie Hawkins dance if these are ever held where you live Sadie Hawkins is when the girls ask the boys out for a dance Pile up your courage and ask him whether hed want to be your date If he says yes he definitely likes you   If this still isnt impressing him try some love letters Make a cute flirty playful letter from a secret admirer and leave it in his locker Leave a secret code word like flower at the end of every note saying if he finds out who you are to say this word to him After the first week start dropping hints that its you by writing about things in the letter that he likes and then talking to him about them Once he sees your common interests he is sure to give you a chance   Dont write anything that you would be embarrassed about if anyone else read it Letters can get misplaced If someone else finds your letter you could both be in for some teasing
When you find your thoughts returning over and over again to that particular person you may benefit from a period of sustained thought about that person For a set period of time even 10 minutes can be enough think only about that personDoing this can lessen the intensity of the feeling leaving you calmer   Try not to think about your future together or what might come focus your thoughts only on that person and their characteristics for the entirety of the time   Sometimes all you need is the right distraction to get your mind off your potential lover Past happy experiences can restore perspective by interrupting the strong feelings you have for that personThink of past times when youve had fun or a place where you feel safe and protected Repeat a mantra that you find soothing Some examples  Everythings going to be OK I am calm cool and collected With every breath I release anxiety and become more calm I overcome my fear and live life courageously In some situations people become so nervous around those they like that they become clumsy or inarticulate If this happens to you find the trigger and think about how you might combat it   If you have difficulty talking to him bring up a topic youre passionate or knowledgeable about If you find that when hes around youre all thumbs invite him for coffee or something that requires little dexterity   Your first letter will celebrate your feelings and all the reasons why you feel the way you do In your second letter write all the worries concerns and sources of anxiety related to the person you like Try to make a case for moving forward after all you are a worthy person regardless if your affections are returned Too often people talk themselves into a negative loop that makes feelings more overwhelming with every passing instant If you suffer with this condition find out any automatic negative thoughts you have and interrupt those with an opposing positive thought For example   If he doesnt like me Ill be so embarrassed and then people will think Im a loser Wait a minute I had friends before I started liking him so I know Ill have friends afterwards too I guess its silly to put so much selfworth on this   Tell the entire dramatic story playing in your head to yourself several times Make sure you complete the story by taking it to its natural extreme By the third or fourth time you should be better able to recognize the absurdity of these extreme yet natural thoughtsIf I ask him out on a date and he rejects me everyone will talk about it forever Ill never stop hearing for the rest of my life about the one time I asked this guy out It will haunt me through college and my professional life because everyone will already know  NOTE this technique is intended to reveal warped perspective to the person using it If you find yourself truly believing these things and unable to see how your perspective is off kilter talk to an adult or a mental health professional     Though feelings of embarrassment or the knowledge of your own infatuation might make you hesitant sharing your feelings with those you trust can help you come to terms with the normalcy of your situation and leave you feeling less isolated Family members and trusted friends can be a great source of strength through the storm of romantic feelings you might now be suffering
Try not to corner your crush or force them to talk with you if they are in a hurry or busy doing something If your crush is chatting with a big group of friends or working on their homework thatâs probably not a good time Wait for a good time to talk to them about it Since theyâre your crush you probably know when they have a little free time during the day It will be a lot easier to talk to them in private plus your crush might get embarrassed if you ask in front of everyone Meet them at their locker in the morning before class or walk with them to one of their classes Before or after lunch might also be a good time Start up a normal chat and then bring it up   If you two share an inside joke or particular interest start off the conversation with that Valentineâs Day is all about sharing how you feel You have nothing to lose and everything to gain Just go for itYou could open with âSo I was wonderingââ and then phrase it however you want You could also start off with âSo today is Valentineâs dayââ and give them a big smile   You donât have to make any grand gestures You can keep it simple   If youâre too shy to ask in person this is the next best thing Keep your message short and sweet You could write âI really like you Would you be my valentineâ Add an emoji like a smiley face or heart after your message to keep everything feeling lighthearted   If youre friends on Facebook or Instagram you could also send them a private message there
A bedridden person may or may not be able to keep with their own hygiene tasks If they cant you or another caregiver will need to help them Even if they can you might need to provide them with reminders and the tools to take care of their hygiene Bathing dental care nail care hair care and changing clothes are all tasks your parent may need help with For bathing you may be able to help your parent into a shower chair using a wheelchair where they can mostly bathe themselves with some supervision On the other hand they may need a sponge bath If your parent is completely bedridden youll need to bring items to them For instance you can bring a toothbrush a cup with clean water and a spitting cup over to the bed Let the person brush their teeth or ask them to open their mouth so you can brush their teeth Make sure you are helping them trim their nails regularly They will likely need help with their toenails even if they dont need help with their fingernails Youll also need to help the person shave An electric razor works best for this process particularly if youve never shaved anyone else  Being bedridden comes with certain health risks that you need to help watch out for if youre providing care for your parent For instance bed sores are a common problem They generally appear where the persons body touches the mattress such as the bottom of the feet the shoulders the buttocks and the back of the headTo combat pressure sores try to change your parents position every 2 hours and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points Pay attention to the sheets They should be cotton or silk and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores Make sure your parents skin is moisturized regularly Also avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder as those can dry out the skin Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day On people with darker skin you may see blue or purple patches while the patches will be red or white on lighterskinned people Cracks wrinkles swelling shiny areas blisters and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs   When laying in bed regularly liquids can build up in the lungs leading to congestion and even pneumonia The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly preferably every 2 hours The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side When your parent becomes bedridden they cant do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularlyEncourage people to come over and visit with your parent so they have regular interaction Also try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible For instance if your parent enjoys making art get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table Its also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about whats going on They need a sounding board as much as you do You can be this person some of the time but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well If you are their only source of support then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on   Often a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs A social worker can benefit you too as they can help you find the care you need for your parent as well as other resourcesMost hospitals have social services on site though you can also visit a MedicareMedicaid office in your local community or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through   When your parent is sick you may feel like youre alone in the situation However more often than not friends and family would like to help you but they dont know how Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for helpIt is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family Try saying Im creating a weekly schedule for Moms care Please let me know which two days you would like this week Offer a specific task if they dont seem to know how to help If you have children then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times   If your parent has become bedridden its likely youll need some help from professional caregivers If youre caring for the person at home you can get help from people who come to the house If the person will need longterm care you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care If your parent has a terminal illness hospice care may provide some reliefBoth inhome care and care facilities can be expensive Insurance and medicare may cover some inhome care which sometimes includes inhome care at senior facilities Have a talk with your parent about getting some help They may not like the idea much as some people are reluctant to have outside help If you need help persuading them try asking someone whos been in a similar situation to help It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead such as a close friend a cousin or a spiritual leader You can hire whatever level of care you need For instance some nonmedical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals However if your parent needs medical care you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor   When your parent is bedridden you likely will have a surplus of emotions which is perfectly normal You may find you feel anger or resentment You might feel guilty that you cant spend more time with them or that theyre bedridden and youre not You also may feel anxiety about the situation Grief is also common as youve lost who your parent wasLet yourself feel those emotions Acknowledge them and give yourself permission to feel them Also make sure you find someone to talk to Anyone with a sympathetic ear will doWriting down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better Try keeping a journal as well You can also talk with others who are facing the same issue You can join a local support group or find one online In fact if your parent is on hospice many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation Just knowing youre not alone can help Professional counseling can also be beneficial If your parent is bedridden particularly if they have a terminal illness it can be difficult to come to terms with that especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with whats happening When it comes to a parents failing health you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable When you have questions about your parents health ask the doctors and nurses If you dont understand their answer ask them to explain it in laypersons terms You deserve to know whats going on with your parents consent of courseTaking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful Emotions may be high which might make it hard for you to remember everything   Take time to do things you normally do for your spiritual self such as praying or meditating These activities can have a calming effect in a stressful situation Of course not everyone considers themselves a spiritual person and that may be the case with you Nonetheless it can still help to take a few minutes each day to just be or sit in silence When youre taking care of a parent it can be difficult to find time for yourself to do things you enjoy However its very important to take time each day to relax if you can It can be something seemingly insignificant like drawing a little picture or watching the birds outside Whatever it is take some time each day to do something you enjoySimilarly its important to maintain the relationships in your life Try to get away to spend time with people you care about so you can just be you for a whileAt the very least set aside some time each day to return calls respond to text messages or check in with your other loved ones Also take time to escape That is sometimes escaping into the fantasy world of a book movie or television show can give you the mental break you need You can even enjoy these with your parent Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a breakBe sure to schedule this time in Donât wait until you feel like you need a break   When youre providing care you need to make sure you know what your limits are Determine how much time you can actually give as well as how much physical care you can give Be firm with those limits and get help as neededFor example it is important to maintain your relationship with your spousepartner and children if you have them This might mean that certain times of the day will be set aside for spending time with your family such as dinner time   When youre caring for someone it can be easy to neglect your physical health but its important to make that a priority too Make sure youre eating enough and that youre eating healthy meals with lean protein whole grains fruits and veggies Try to get some exercise in when you can as it will lower your stress level and keep you healthyIn addition make getting enough sleep a priority Even if you can get enough sleep all at at once try to work in 7 to 9 hours a day to make sure youll be able to function Finally make sure you are keeping up your regular doctors appointments and dental care so that you stay healthy

You were your own unique and perfectly content person long before this guyâs opinion ever meant a thing to you the more you remember and act on that the stronger and more attractive youâll feel In fact it may help to think back on all the other ways that this guy demonstrated his poor judgment Are his actions idiotic Was he a Geologist Did he always wear socks with sandals Maybe the signs were there all alongâ  Not only will you be doing yourself a favor by emotionally disengaging but since nothing is more unpleasant than unwelcome attention you might be able to recover a few shards of a friendship with him If you simply cannot function around him or you think you would start to like him more once near find inconspicuous ways to avoid him until you feel more centered   He couldâve pretended to like you in order to manipulate you more Then whereâd you be You might feel heartbroken now but at least be relieved that he didnât actively deceive you leading to more intense heartbreak   Maybe he exploited your feelings for him and advised others to do the same Maybe he constantly interrupted you and dreamed of being a pet taxidermist Maybe you were in love with the fantasy of this guy and not the guy himself Dredging all the ugly details will help you realize that just maybe heâs doing you a big favor by being such a jerk That way you didnât realize these flaws until you were at the altar   Following step 2 and becoming a fulltime hermit is just going to make you feel like heâs the only person in the world Go out with your pals have a girlsâ night and socialize as much as possible The more you meet your emotional needs elsewhere the more you wonât pay that lost cause any attention

Some of these will be fairly obvious She may want to be with someone with the same religious values or a nonsmoker You dont have to necessarily meet all of her criteria but you should avoid failing to meet her standards as this will often remove you from her romantic poolMake a list of features shared by all her previous boyfriends These are likely things she makes it a priority to find in her romantic interests and may be characteristics you should consider cultivating in yourself  This is often related to her own personal characteristics Many people including your female friend search for a partner with the same positive characteristics that they like in themselves but want qualities in a partner that are opposite to the things they dislike about themselvesAfter you find out some of the things she dislikes about herself show her how you can compliment those areas with your strengths You could say I hate how competitive I am I think Id be much happier if I learned to enjoy things instead of making them into a competition What about you If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be   Psychologists have discovered that as we go through life we start developing a love map or an idea of who we want to be in a relationshipSome aspects of her love map will be conscious like she might want an educated partner but these can also be subconscious preferences like how affectionate her partner is By understanding her love map you can meet her needs better Though there are many variables that will affect her particular love map look for these criteria to guide you in understanding her love map   The expectation of romantic relationships to involve commitment The accepted duration for a relationship A belief that the right romantic partner will bring satisfaction The ideal length of time acceptable before arriving at a romantic commitment saying âI love youâ The length of time between a breakup and becoming involved in a new relationship The acceptable length of time spent waiting for a partner to commit The level of acceptable disagreement on basic life values Whether or not an argument with a partner is exciting or frightening Whether or not a polyamorous relationship is acceptable The amount of time expected to be spent seperate from friends family and social eventsobligations Be on your best behavior when you do so because these people will give you a window into her life that few others will have at their disposal If youre serious about your love for your female friend expressing your genuine caring for her to her friends will likely earn you their respect and maybe their approval   You dont have to bare your heart and confess your love to her friends try to earn the respect of her friends by being a nice guy Explain how youve noticed shes been stressed and ask what they think you can do Or mention that shes been a good friend and you want to do something nice what do they think shed appreciate   Breakups especially difficult breakups will cause her to revise her love map whether consciously or unconsciously By showing her that you are different from her ex youll make yourself a more desirable potential partner Science has shown that the chemicals released when you and her experience fear together are linked closely with arousal and attractionThrilling experiences can give you both a dose of good anxiety and set the tone for the next stage in your relationship   Roller coasters and amusement parks are a great way to get the blood pumping without actually scaring her A suspenseful thriller can also have this effect though you might want to avoid slasher and gorefilled films You dont want yourself associated with the homicidal even if you do want her heart   The physical response you have to a workout mimics your bodys response to arousalBy exercising together not only will you both be riding an endorphin high which shell start associating with you but also shell likely see you in a more attractive light This may seem underhanded but if you really are a good match and she just cant see it your efforts to win her over can get a boost when supported by a trusted source like her friendsIf her friends think youre great chances are shell agree This can only work to your advantage while winning her heart   The more you hear something the more youll believe its trueThis same fact will work in your favor when winning over your female friend You dont have call every five minutes which might put her off but by staying in sight or being around her frequently youll reinforce the naturalness of your presence there   This may seem a little over the top and you might not want to employ something as obvious as a candlelit dinner After all you dont want to come on too strong However studies have shown that large pupils are a signal to which your female friend will unconsciously respondDilated pupils can be an indication of many things but for your situation most important is that pupils dilate when feeling physical or psychological pleasureGoing to a movie as friends or a dimly lit coffee shop and making eye contact will send her subconscious the sign that you have chemistry   When you feel like youve met your perfect match its easy to say too much too soon Holding back can be difficult but by not giving her all the details shell find her mind wondering more and more about you which could lead feelings of friendship to something more This can be tricky as every woman will have a different level of flirtation she is comfortable with Take cues from her past relationships What did you notice other guys did that worked What flopped Remember its important to respect her boundaries even when trying to win her heart   Compliment with a hint of sexiness Instead of saying that she looks good you might instead say If only my last date were as breathtaking as you This way you indicate subtly that you think you would be a good match while complimenting her Find ways to be physically close In all relationships closeness is a sign of comfort and intimacyThough keep in mind some people need more personal space than others Dont force closeness find ways of naturally and comfortably coming together The hushed atmosphere of museums makes whispering while standing close normal Allow your touches to linger You will need to gauge her comfort level before attempting this as an unexpected touch can come across as pushy But physical touch releases oxytocin in the blood sometimes referred to as the love hormone If your female friend is externally dependent that is if she relies on people or things outside of herself to feel good about herself its likely she will be thrilled if you chase after herBe wary of coming on too strong Many independent women consider that kind of behavior to be suffocating which wont win you points in her book of love   This is your friend and even if youve been suffering with these romantic feelings for a long time the last thing you should want is to make her feel uncomfortable Strong emotions make it easy to get carried away dont allow your strong feelings to compromise your friendship   Journaling about your feelings can help you feel less overwhelmed which can be a powerful preventative for making a hasty emotional decisionWrite a personal letter This will help you get all the things you want to say down on paper without having said them to your female friend Now you can think about whether these might come across as too strong the last thing you want is to scare her away especially if theres potential for love   Does she constantly want to hang out with you alone Do you find her looking at you more frequently or did she break up with a boyfriend for no particular reason that you know ofThese can all be signals that she is becoming interested in you as more than just a friend   This can be dangerous as sometimes friends will make decisions on their own that they feel is best for your female friend However if she has a friend that you are also friends with and trust you can get a clear read on the situation by asking if you stand a chance   Be sure you express yourself clearly Has she said anything about me I really want to be the one to tell her myself but Ive been thinking lately that we might be good as more than friends   As her friend this will be a lot easier for you to determine than some stranger off the street Pay attention to her work schedule home life social life and any other factor that might be adding stress to her life or making her unhappy You dont want these to influence her decision negatively   To give yourself the best odds you should ask on a clear comfortable day when she is not too tired or stressed Unfortunately as uncomfortable as being vulnerable can be this is the only way you are going to be able to express your feelings for your female friendBut you can take comfort in the fact that everyone at some point feels vulnerable and use this to your advantage   As an example you might confess your feelings by saying This isnt easy for me Im not the best at being vulnerable and its always been hard for me to put my feelings out there I dont want things to change between us if you arent comfortable but lately Ive been finding myself wondering about what it would be like if we went out on a date together   Especially if the friendship is important to you and you want it to continue even if she isnt interested in dating its important that you let her know thisYou I hope Im not making you uncomfortable by saying this and I want you to know no matter what happens nothing will change on my end if you dont want it to But I cant stop myself from feeling like there might be something more between us and I have to know if you feel this way too   This does not mean hire a string quartet and sing out your love in front of her apartment complex The way you express your feelings will be unique to your relationship If shes the type that likes grand gestures maybe the string quartet is the way to go But remember you are shifting the nature of your relationship and thats a big step already Be careful you dont say anything over the top or jump into things too fast this may only hurt your chances with her If youre pretty sure she likes you as more than just a friend too theres no harm in seeing where things go If you can help her see you as a romantic interest its possible love will grow from the friendship  it happens all the time If she flirts with you sometimes or says things like I can always be myself with you and no one else feel encouraged to open her eyes to your love for her   If she hasnt flirted with you or otherwise shown romantic interest you can still reveal your feelings to her While you cant control how shell react you can be yourself and see if shed consider dating you instead of just being friends   She may like things just the way they are Revealing your feelings is going to be a game changer If she says she likes you too the relationship will change if she says shes not that into you it will also change Worst case scenario she wont feel as comfortable with you anymore and she wont feel able to just go back to your normal friendship   Respect her feelings and her answer No matter how much you love her you cant make her love you back She doesnt owe that to you If you really care about her dont keep trying to win her after shes already turned you down
If youve watched your crush and have gotten to know their personality choose conversation topics that interest them Think about the things they like such as their favorite show a sport they enjoy or a musician that they listen to If you dont have any ideas then ask them about themselves or talk about an event thats coming up in your town   You can also compliment your crush but dont make it sexual You can say something like Hey the noticed that you were listening to the new Drake album I was thinking about picking it up What do you think of it   Make eye contact with your crush and approach them with a smile If youve never talked to them before tell them your name and ask them for theirs Even though youll probably be nervous make sure that you introduce yourself with confidence Dont look away or mumble because its a sign that youre insecure   To appear more confident make sure to speak clearly keep a straight posture and use your hands to gestureKeep the conversation light and try to be humorous Dont be overly serious or personal when you first approach your crush If you had a good conversation with your crush its important that you keep it going so you dont have to watch them without being noticed anymore Ask for social media usernames or their cell phone number See if they would want to hang out in the future or go on a date sometime   If the conversation went poorly your crush may not want to give you their contact information In this case remain respectful and back off   If you feel overwhelmed and cant talk to your crush directly you can try to become friends with your crushs friends first Try to find someone in their circle of friends that share mutual interests with you and make it a point to talk to them or hang out with them socially Once you feel like you are good enough friends you can ask them to introduce you to their crush   When a mutual friend makes the introductions it can relieve stress on both parties Long term relationships are often started by introductions made by mutual friends

Seeing your crush with another guy is not a good feeling especially if you had no idea she was with someone else already You thought you had a chance with her and suddenly you realize that you donât Your first instinct might be to panic or even get angry Getting upset is a normal reaction You might find yourself breathing very fast or holding your breath when this happens This can make your anxiety a lot worse unfortunately   Take a moment to focus on your breathingBreathe slowly and deeply If it helps close your eyes for a moment Inhale while counting to five then exhale while counting to five  The more you look at her with someone else the more it will hurt Itâs going to be hard but force yourself to look away If you donât you might start getting visibly upset which will make you feel even worse If youre staring she might notice and get uncomfortable Her boyfriend might also notice and get angry Youll feel better if you focus on something else   Pull out a book or your class notes and focus on reading Even if youâre too upset to read do what you can to keep your eyes on the page If youâre not in class pull out your phone and text a friend or play a game   This isnât always going to be an option but if you can get up and leave the room Try to do this as calmly and naturally as you can Keep your pace normal as you head for the door Find a quiet place where you can have a moment of privacy Your thoughts will probably feel really negative at first You might feel angry at yourself or not good enough This is normal   For every negative thought you have try to immediately follow it up with a positive one For instance you might think âHe is way more popular than me and better at sports too Of course she likes him over meâ Try to counter this with a positive thought right away You could think âBut Iâm popular too I have lots of friends Maybe Iâm not good at sports but Iâm good at other thingsâ   Make sure itâs someone you trust and can be open with Tell your friend what happened even if you feel a little embarrassed about it   Chances are your friend has experienced this very same situation It tends to happen to everyone at some point Talking about it with a friend can help you feel a lot better
It most often happens when a guy tries to act up for a new girl he will look like a pretentious oaf Being yourself is a much better method Not only that but the girls that do like you will be ones you will get on with a whole lot more why Because they share your real interests not fake ones you made up to impress people And besides a lot of girls go for dorky guys its very sweet   Not only that being good at sports can impress a girl but it also tones up your muscles therefore improving your body appearance and making you look more manly   Everybody likes funny guys a good sense of humor is very appreciated by most people Even if you cant tell a joke to save your life girls will appreciate you for trying   This is perhaps the most difficult thing for guys to do some would rather bite their tongue to avoid saying something related to their feelings than to actually say it A girl is very pleased to find out that guys do have feelings Showing that you can be hurt that you care is not an act of weakness on the contrary it means that you had the strength to overcome your fear of vulnerability   On the other hand dont go about feeling sorry for yourself Be a man when you need to being afraid of everything and everyone wont get you too far When youve got problems face them and try to solve them instead of denying their existence   Everyone is equal and this isnt the 50s Chivalry is not the same as patronizing someone   Show her you are capable of intelligent conversation Burping contests and potty humor are fun but consider your audience Some girls feel that stuff is immature
You donât want to only French kiss endlessly Break it up now and then with a little sensual kissing in other ways   For example some men or boys have very sensitive ear lobes Try kissing his ear lobe his jawline and his neck and see how he responds Embrace him If your boyfriend seems to like this you can move back and forth between such sensual kissing and French kissing He will likely find it very tantalizing   There are a few key tips to making yourself a better kisser For one no one wants to kiss someone who doesnât take care of his or her breath So make sure your breath is fresh and your mouth is clean   Pop a mint brush your teeth use mouthwash or buy those little mouth freshener strips that dissolve in your mouth or mouth freshener you spray into your mouth if youâre looking for something portable Go slowly Donât think you have to pummel his mouth like a jack hammer The best kissing usually lets the intensity build and then dissipates before building again Be sensual Go slow   One mistake that beginning kissers make is they think they have to shove their entire tongue down their partners throat   You donât You can just push your tongue into his mouth a little bit and let it dance around Then thrust it in but not so far that it feels like you are gagging your partner Breathe through your nose when kissing Try not to get saliva all over him When youâre done with kissing him wind it down back to the little warm up kisses rather than just suddenly stopping

Sometimes a relationship will go sour Can you determine why Figuring out what went wrong doesnt mean youll fix it as sometimes its not able to be fixed but identifying what makes you feel this way can be a huge help   Do most conversations that start off friendly or romantic end in fights Does your friend or partner not listen to what you say or take you seriously Do they mock you belittle you put you down or tell you that they wish you didnt exist Do they play mind games or manipulate you and expect you to know something that you have no way of knowing such as what theyre thinking Do they physically or sexually abuse you or threaten to do so Does the relationship as a whole just cause you to feel drained exhausted worthless or like youre trying so hard for something that isnt giving you results  Theres never a relationship thats always happy and cheerful and healthy friendships or relationships do have the occasional argument here and there In addition stressful situations and hard times can make a person act like they arent themselves and cause you two to get into fights However theres a difference between a fight here and there and a destructive relationship If the number of days where youre fighting are outnumbering the days where you arent or if your friend or partner is causing you serious physical or emotional harm its time to think about whether the relationship is healthy   For example if youve identified that many of the conversations end in fights but nothing else its quite possible that the relationship is just in a bad place that may fade However if the fights contain verbal or physical abuse manipulation or mind games or leave you feeling depressed and like the relationship isnt worth saving then it may be time to cut the relationship short   If you have determined that the relationship is abusive and you tell your friend or partner that you wish to leave they may manipulate you into staying by begging crying or threatening you or others Dont fall for it Yes the person can change like they say theyre going to but whats the likelihood of them doing it   Recall all the times this person made you feel bad about yourself If theyve made you feel bad or harmed you many times theyre not likely to stop because they know you wont leave On the flip side if you are the one belittling or hurting your partner then its best to cut the relationship short yourself Dont tell them that its their fault Be honest Tell them that you dont think its safe for you to be friends with them or dating them and you need to cut contact in order to try and work on yourself Then do it Dont transfer this behavior to somebody else If your friend or partner actively prevents you from leaving such as by taking important things like car keys or money or threatening serious harm to you get to a safer place such as a parents house if possible and call authorities If the relationship is that destructive theres no way of getting out safely by yourself   If you have determined the relationship is destructive keep an eye out for what is commonly called the cycle of abuse  the honeymoon period the tension and then the blowup Its very common for a destructive relationship to have this pattern with one or both parties as they can be rather emotional   Depending on how destructive this relationship is and if you and the person live together you may not be able to do it facetoface While a facetoface discussion is best for other situations it isnt worth the risk if you suspect it wont go over well   If your friend or partner is significantly abusive do not do this face to face They likely know you well enough to manipulate you into staying around and if they cant trick you you may end up getting emotionally hurt or physically injured Try to avoid over the phone if the person is verbally abusive as well If you live with this person and suspect theyll stop you from leaving the house wait until they leave and call someone you trust to come get you However if the situation is desperate you can try going to a neighbors and phoning a person you trust there or the police   Depending on how you plan to leave you will have to know how youll do it and how to stay calm If the relationship is destructive and the other party agrees that its best for it to end it may be calm but it may not end calmly   Think of how the person may respond and come up with answers to those responses However keep in mind that they may throw you for a loop by asking a question or saying something you didnt expect from them Remember to stay calm no matter what they said to you If you cant end things facetoface its best not to end it officially at all as this requires leaving something behind Even something like a note or a voice memo can work against you if the person takes it to someone else to try and track you   If youre ending it facetoface approach the person Tell them calmly I dont think this relationship is healthy anymore I think its best if we go our separate ways Be aware that theyll likely be upset by this but stay calm regardless of what they do   If the person is not verbally abusive but is physically abusive do not carry it out facetoface However a lot of people who are physically abusive will also be verbally abusive so in this case it may just be best to flee without telling the person if you fear getting hurt   If you dont live with this person it may be easier to get away from them since its possible you may only have to see them at school or work However if you live with the person you will need to make plans on how to get away if youve deemed it necessary You dont necessarily have to move into a new home or apartment but staying with another friend or a family member will suffice   Do not leave any traces of where you will be going If you are discussing this with the person you plan to be staying with discuss it in person or over a phone call so that you dont leave evidence in texts or letters that you will be leaving Dont write it in a journal or anywhere you suspect the person may look If they suspect you will leave and want to prevent you from doing so it will give them pointers as to where to wait for you or cause them to harm somebody If you think this person is going to stalk you file a restraining order While a piece of paper may not do much to deter the stalker it will be evidence to the police that this person is harassing you   If the person pleads with you that they can change dont believe them  theres a reason youre leaving after all Why would you be leaving the relationship if you didnt feel it was destructive   If the person threatens to commit suicide over you leaving make it clear that you dont control what they do and believe it yourself Remember that you dont have control over anyone that isnt you   Even if you know the relationship was destructive and extremely unhealthy you may grieve the loss Let yourself grieve but dont let the grief consume your life After at least a week try to get your life back in order   Do not return to the relationship no matter what youre feeling about it If you find yourself remembering all the good parts and thinking that maybe it can work if you just change this one piece of it recall what made you want to leave in the first place and how often it would happen Do you really want to be friends with or dating someone who doesnt treat you like youre worth all that you are   After youve had some time away from the relationship find something to occupy your time You can go to schoolwork your jobs work resume an old hobby or pick up a new one or anything else you want to try   Do not take up destructive habits If you begin to drink excessively use drugs or begin injuring yourself then get help immediately   Maybe while in the destructive relationship you abandoned old friends or family members Try to reach out to them and apologize for shutting them out If you want make plans to see them and make sure to have fun while doing so   Keep in mind that depending on how you treated your friends they may no longer trust you or want to be your friend If they forgive you dont jump right back into how things used to be  take some time to rebuild the friendship and trust in it   Depending on how destructive the relationship was and how long it lasted you may be scared of opening up to people again or feel like what they said about you was true However remember that not everyone will treat you poorly and you are not somebody elses words or actions You are you and what happened in your past does not make you undesirable dirty or worthless Keep yourself open to new people   If you feel constantly sad empty guilty or worthless or if you feel anxious or jumpy all the time try to see a therapist Its possible that a destructive relationship can cause mental disorders such as depression If you begin engaging in selfdestructive habits such as selfinjury reckless driving reckless spending of money or abusing alcohol or drugs get help immediately Nobody should make you behave in ways that are destructive to your health
Make sure to say hi when you first see your crush everyday If you pass them in the hall wave and smile If you see them in class you can say âGood morning Howâs it goingâ This will help your crush notice and remember you Find an excuse to be near them during the day If you donât have assigned seats you can take the seat next to them in class or you can eat near them at lunch time  If you want you can come up to them and say âHey is this seat takenâ If youâre feeling shy about approaching them ask your friends if they would help you out One of your friends can take a seat close to your crush and you can sit next to your friend   A good way to break the ice is to ask your crush questions Perhaps you need help with a math question or maybe you didnât catch the homework Always thank them when they give you the answerFor example you can say âHey I forgot my book today Can I look onto yoursâ If your teacher says you need to work with a partner you can ask your crush âDo you want to work together on thisâ Remember to smile as you say it   Once you have started talking you can casually ask about their interests hobbies or plans Try to find out what theyâre interested in and start talking to them about itYou can start the conversation by saying something about your own interests For example you can say âDo you listen to this band I have had their new song stuck in my head all dayâ If they havenât heard of the band you might ask âSo what kind of music do you likeâ   Look for ways to connect over common interests hobbies or practices If you know they enjoy something you can start a conversation about it or you can invite them to do the activity with you  Look at their clothes bags and other belongings for clues about what they enjoy For example you can say âI noticed the pins on your bag Do you like anime tooâ
Think about the place youre going if youre looking to meet women abroad and consider changing your choice of destination if its that important to you If you can imagine a vacation location as being exciting and potentially romantic theres a good chance youll be able to meet women there   Cruises for example are generally intended for committed couples unless the cruise is listed as being otherwise Tropical resorts or festive cities on the other hand attract singles in droves  Because most everyone going will be single a singles cruise will vastly increase your chance to striking up conversation with single women   Conceivably meeting someone on any cruise ship would be a romantic experience but due to the fact that cruises are regularly associated with couples your bet luck will be had with singles cruises   Many of these involve resorts where other singles may congregate and make their own fun together If you have a rough idea where youd like to go look into whether the region in question has any packages suited for your intent and situation   While some people prefer to take it easy and lay back while theyre on vacation there are almost always good way of meeting single women when youre abroad Once you have a destination picked out look into the attractions The best place for meeting women will be highenergy settings where alcohol is involvedClubs bars and the beach are all great places to start Try to steer away from places that attract families   Your party will also have a considerable impact on your chances of meeting women Going with your family wont help your odds for example but going with a group of fellow singles who are intent on the same thing will make it easier to find fresh opportunities during the vacation
If you dont want to dirty things then set them on a clean surface Make sure the room is completely empty  Take cardboard boxes out If there is any mold or fungus on them replace them with new ones   This can include grooming kits nonleather stirrups metal spurs small pieces of synthetic tack etc   You may need to wipe some clean with a wet cloth Take a stick in a circular motions and go around the top of the tack room to remove and cob or spider webs   This will remove the dirt off the floor and it will make it look much betterIf there is too much dirt use an outdoor vacuum if possible   Wipe down the toilet and sink them spray them with an allpurpose cleaner Clean the inside of the toilet as well with Clorox and a toilet scrubber   If the toilet seat is cracked replace it Make sure the saddle racks are screwed in correctly and not broken Replace broken windows as this presents a hazard Relabel any racks or shelves if the old tags are not clear   Make sure they are dry Try to have a box bag or bucket to store all small items with the exception of girths reins and stirrup leathers which are best hung up Make sure that bottles are upright   Put the most commonly used items like grooming kits within easy reach and the less frequently used items like clippers out of the way   Ideally they should be in a row along the wall If you teach riding lessons and have lots of saddles consider using racks the go on the wall The bridles should correspond to the location of the saddle   Bring in the tack and rugs Order tack by the horse itâs used on rather than type and keep the grooming kit near too
If a girl compliments you she could very well like you This may be her way of making you feel desired   She might say things like âyou have amazing eyesâ or âyouâre so athletic  do you play any sportsâ   If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling this probably means that she has told her friends about you and theyre in the know In some cases a friend may actually be bold enough to come and tell you that her friend likes you   When she is having a conversation with her friends and you come over they might stop talking all of a sudden This likely means that you were the subject of the recently ended conversation   When a girl likes you she will often try to impress you with her style She may choose to wear slightly revealing clothes or put on lipstick to catch your eyeEvery girl has a different sense of style and not all girls will try to dress as aforementioned when they like somebody However if you notice that the girl youâre wondering about dresses a little more nicely around you it could be a sign that she wants to impress you   When a girl likes you she may tease you lightly about certain things you do or say Ways of teasing include calling you out on a joke that actually wasnât that funny poking fun at something youâre wearing or lightly telling you that youâre trying too hard   She may âfriendâ you on social media talk to you in person every day after class or text you randomly These could be signs that this girl is intrigued and wants to get to know you more   This alone is not a definitive sign that a girl likes you A girl who just wants to be friends may also try to engage in conversation with you But if a girl tries to talk to you often exhibits a number of flirty body language cues and compliments you often she may be trying to tell you that she likes you   When a girl likes you she will want to know whether you are single or not so that she can decide if she should flirt with you She may directly ask you if you have a girlfriend or she may use a subtler approach   She might tease you by saying things like âI bet you went to see that movie with your girlfriendâ If you like her use this as an opportunity to flirt back You could say âI donât have a girlfriend but I have been meaning to see that moviewant to go with me Friday nightâ   When a girl likes you she may pretend to be in a mildly vulnerable situation to test your response For example if youre outside and the girl you like starts saying Im cold thats a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweater Doing so is a very sweet gesture especially if you want to show the girl that you like her   Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at doing something like saying she doesnât understand the homework That is your chance to offer some assistance be aware that she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to test your reaction in hopes that you will help out When offering assistance if she doesnt fancy you but there is somebody she likes in the room she may pout or show other signs of disappointment if you offer to help first In this case at least youll know how she feels and will be able to move on   If shes always there for you when you need her she might like you But dont assume that shes into you only from one experience Ask her occasionally for small things like chewing gum or a pen and notice how she reacts If shes eager to help you and shows other signs of liking you then she very well might   Donât use this approach too much or a tasks that seem too difficult she may think youre lazy testing her or are even a bit of a nuisance So dont overdo it you dont want to risk her ceasing to like you if she indeed does   If a girl flirts with you it doesnât necessarily mean that she likes you She may just get a thrill out of flirting or she may not even notice that sheâs flirting The best way to see if she is just flirting with you and itâs not just her naturally flirty demeanor coming through is to notice how she acts around other people   If she treats you differently than she does others be it by holding eye contact just a bit longer with you than with anybody else or by being gentler in her teasing with you then she may like you

When youâre together pay attention to where he orients himself in relation to youâespecially when youâre out with other people Think of the physical distance between the two of you as the emotional distance that he wants to maintain The farther he keeps his body away when youâre sitting or standing together the less he wants others to think of you two as being togetherTake this less to heart if you know he tends to be shy or reserved If thats your guy he could be nervous around you because he cares about you or he may want to avoid coming across as someone whos going to smother you   If he hates romantic comedies ask him to go see one with you If he doesnât particularly like one or more of your friends ask him to come along when you go out to see them Test how willing he is to keep you happy If heâs happy to do things that heâd rather not do just to keep you happy be assured that this means he cares about youBe careful not to overdo it If all you ever do is drag him to places that you know he doesnt like he may start to resent it after a while   If he goes surfing every weekend say you want to come along to the beach even if you donât know how to surf If he has a regular hangout that he goes to like an arcade or coffee shop suggest going together See how willing he is to include you in all aspects of his lifeRespect the fact that everyone needs to do their own thing if he doesnât want to make a habit out of bringing you along every single time But at the very least he should be willing to include you every once and a while just so you can see what matters so much to him   When he says heâs going to do something note whether he actually does it Pay attention to how punctual he is when youâre supposed to meet or call each other If he fails to show up on time ask for the reason why and see if itâs a valid excuseEveryone runs late or forgets to do stuff every now and then But if he consistently fails to follow through on his word consider that a sign that he doesnât think of you as someone worth proving himself to   Whether itâs big or small see how quickly he offers to do it If he fetches you another soda from the fridge just so you donât have to get up or gives you his jacket because you feel a chill then he cares about you If he does it without thinking twice about it or expecting a reward he cares even moreObviously if itâs a really big favor like âfix my carâ heâll probably have to think things over at first if only to figure out if and when he could possibly do such a timeconsuming project   In passing refer back to a previous conversation youâve had with him If you told him a story about school or work last week tell him how things turned out since then See how much he remembers from the first storyOf course he may not have the same job as you or attend the same class so he may not have had a strong grasp on all the details in the first place But expect him to at least remember the point of the story   Mention your own hopes and plans Ask him where he sees himself a year from now in five years in ten Pay close attention to how he answers See how much your two visions conflict with each other and if they do how much effort he makes into combining the two into one shared vision The more he talks about âweâ and the less he uses âIâ the more likely he thinks of you as someone to plan his own future around
A great way to help look after wolves while raising awareness about the destruction of their natural environment is to volunteer at a wolf sanctuary Search online to see if there is one near you You are more likely to find a local sanctuary if you live in a state that has wild wolvesResearch the sanctuary and get in touch with them saying youâd like to volunteer Volunteer roles can be competitive so you will have to show why you are a good choice Volunteering schemes can vary from evenings and weekends to placements where you are on site for a few weeks perhaps over a whole summer Volunteers in sanctuaries will generally do a widevariety of things such as cleaning out enclosures feeding the animals working in the gift shop and conducting tours  If you would prefer to get out into the open country there are a number of organisations that have volunteer programmes where you can do just that Search for wolf preservation volunteering online and look for programmes that involve hiking or cycling in the country You may camp and be asked to take photos of the environment while acting as a positive spokesperson for wolvesYou should understand that you are very unlikely to actually come into contact with any wolves You will most likely be tasked with maintaining the environment assisting with daily jobs and talking to visitors about wolvesThis is a great way to experience the outdoors meet new people and help to save wolves all at the same time   Another way to volunteer is to help an organisation with their office work as well as their campaigning fundraising and outreach work Search for the offices of wolf and wildlife charities that you could travel to and contact them Explain what motivates you and what skills and experience you have that can help   Volunteers are vital for many charities so donât be shy about getting in touchVolunteering like this can also be great way to develop all sorts of skills and experiences that help you develop It might not seem as exciting as being in a sanctuary or out in the country but a successful campaign needs people in the office   A great way to get involved in a movement to help protect wolves is to attend events and meetings that take place There may be events locally that you can attend in order to hear people talking about the situation and what needs to be done This is also a great way to meet people who know a lot about wolves and who can help you get more involved   This may involve going to local Town Hall meetings or other such events and speaking up about the plight of wolves If your state has a lot of pressing issues to do with wolves you may find debates and listening sessions about relevant legislation and regulation that you can attend Look on the websites of wolf charities for lists of upcoming events
This is harsh sounding and puts an end to the connection While you dont wish to date this guy or get on intimate terms with him it still remains important to respect his dignity and let him down gently   Begin by explaining that youre flattered by his interest in you and that it is very kind of him to ask However youll also need to explain your lack of interest in general terms without suggesting that there is anything wrong with him For example you might say something along these lines   Thats nice of you to ask but right now Im still looking for the right guy Thank you for your attention thats so sweet and I am really flattered The trouble is Im just not interested in dating anybody at the moment But it was so kind of you to ask   Avoid laughing or using jokes as a way of negating what he has just asked you Make it clear that youve appreciated the effort and his courage but thats the end of it no need to rub salt into the wound   If you do wish to make humor use the selfdeprecating sort that rebounds on you not on him or anybody else And dont overdo it or itll look as if youre trying too hard   If possible tell him that your current focus is absolutely on your career your new business startup your university exams your overseas trip whatever This way it doesnt feel like a personal rejection but is simply an outcome of a broader reality that youre just too wed to something else   Its not your place to butter up his ego but its always a nice thing to offer a soft letdown to anyone who receives rejection   Dont drag it on and become nervous chatty or full of excuses Any of these things will make it more awkward for you than it is for him and opens up too many possibilities for him to try to convince you to make space for him in your life
Whenever she is in trouble or worried about something dont just sit there with her Acknowledge that you dont have all the answers and that you may not know exactly what shes going through but try to help make the situation better for her   Ask her how you can help but dont insist that she let you Be patient with anything she goes through and be supportive When you can make a difference do so without hesitation but also cautiously as you dont want to hurt her in any way If she likes you already go above and beyond the call of duty Do something that shed never expect you to do like cooking her breakfast and then doing the dishes and shell fall even harder for you Youre showing her what youre made of If she doesnt like you yet or you dont know how she feels about it play it cool Be calm If youre the kind of guy who gets sweaty and stutters his words when hes around a girl then just calm down Think of her as just your friend who happens to look different If you cant calm down no sweat Girls think it is adorable when guys trip over themselves Youll make her laugh in a good way  Be friendly with her without always being available Girls love guys who are a bit mysterious so try to cultivate a bit of mystery â dont always pick up the phone let on where youre going etc Be honest but not always totally up front   Your guyfriends probably didnt care that you walked around in the same clothes you mowed the lawn in but the girl of your dreams probably wont be very impressed Here are three simple things you can start doing right away that will help   Shower and shave every day If youre not yet old enough to shave dont sweat it You should be soon Smell nice and look clean by showering or bathing regularly Wear clothes that actually fit Not your older brothers clothes not your dads clothes Wear your own clothes and ones that flatter your figure It doesnt matter how much money you have â every guy needs a good pair of jeans a fitting tshirt a simple but elegant collared shirt and shoes to fit the occasion Get in shape Lose that excess flab if you can and turn it into muscle Most girls like guys who have developed muscles that arent so chiseled theyre intimidating Find an intramural sports league that youre interested in and go for it You might even be able to impress your lady with your skills   Most men are charming in a couple different ways but here are some charming ideas to think about   Be a gentleman This means opening doors paying for a date keeping your word etc Girls love to feel like a gentleman cares about them  Be witty Girls love guys who are great conversationalists who can turn anything into a joke Learn how to elegantly make fun of yourself Be intelligent You should do your best to be wellread informed about currentaffairs and curious Women like men who are smart but still relatable   Every girl wants a guy who at the end of the day is reliable â dependable not because he has to be but because he wants to be Being reliable is all about telling a girl that she has security with you Try to be the most reliable guy you know   Do what you say youre going to do If you talk the talk walk the walk Girls dont like guys who say theyre going to do something and never follow through with it Be punctual Even though some girls are late to dates a girl hates it when she has to wait on a guy To her it says I dont care enough about you to be ontime If youre going to be late let her know Have a good reputation Be the guy that other guys want to vouch for You never know whether she or one of her friends could ask around about you And if she hears how you cheated on your exgirlfriend your reputation is shot and youll have to rebuild it   A person is more responsive and receptive when relaxed This is similar to being witty but with higher importance It helps you connect with her emotionallyintellectually She should enjoy your company and not be bored   Its a turnoff when youre always around her and touching her and flirting obnoxiously with her when she is not interested and has never shown any interest at all Learn to give her the control even if its only the illusion of control   If a girl doesnt want to make out for example or have sex dont try to force it out of her Thats not the way to get her obsessed with you Instead listen to her wishes understand why she has them and respect them Youll get more bees with honey than you will with vinegar   Most women dont care how much you make or who your parents are so long as you can provide for them Thats nice because most men arent blessed with wealth Remember these things about money around women   Women like men want to be spoiled some of the time It doesnt have to be extravagant but they like to be spoiled Save enough money so that you can spoil her every once in a while Most women dont like men who flaunt their money If you have money dont flaunt it because you just might scare her away   A girl might really like you but if she sees you dancing or talking with another girl that could be a dealbreaker Make sure she knows youre interested in only her   At the same time have friends who are also girls If you hang around friends who are also girls shell feel safer around you because other women are comfortable hanging out with you If you never hang around any women it could be a sign to her that youre illiterate when it comes to them Sometimes women engage in a little competition â just like men Therefore its helpful to have other women around provided you dont get involved or flirt with them   Give her some good oldfashioned compliments Dont compliment her ability to do every little thing perfectly or youll seem too needy or obsessive yourself But a wellplaced compliment can make a girl remember you for days on end   Be sincere when you compliment Figure out what you like about her best â what you think makes her most unique â and tell her If its the truth it will automatically come out as sincere Reinforce how she views herself If she thinks of herself as an athlete reinforce her competitive spirit or athletic skills If she thinks of herself as a thinker praise her smarts Whatever she thinks of herself as compliment that aspect of her the most Focus more on her personality than her appearance If you have to get in a compliment about her appearance stay away from the more feminine areas and stick to complimenting these  Smile Hair Eyes Lips Clothes style appearance etc     Sing or hum songs talk about movies share favorite places Anything that when she hearssees it again will make her think of you   Girls like guys who are in touch with their feminine side without being girly at all That means you have to understand where shes coming from but still be thoroughly manly if you can Learn a lesson from the following cues   Its OK to cry at a movieif that movie is about sports While most girls dont like sports its a badge of your manliness to her Be prepared to stick with sports while still making time to see her Its OK to dress wellbut not too well As discussed earlier girls love a guy who can dress nicely But as soon as the guy dresses nicer than her that can be a big turnoff   You should not make building a relationship with her a script The most important thing to do when looking for a meaningful relationship is to relax around her and let your true personality shine through Do not force yourself to fit a stereotype Youre better off waiting until you can find a girl who likes you not a stereotypical cool guy A relationship in which you can be yourself is much much more meaningful than one in which you have to pretend to be someone else   Be yourself and be a gentlemen Let her do what she wants and act like you care about her
Does the guy seem to appear out of nowhere with flowers or just wanting to talk Maybe itâs because he knows you get to school at the same time every morning Switch up your routine and see if that helps to avoid him a little better   If you do have classes together arrive at the very last minute  just make sure you have a friend save a seat for you one thatâs not anywhere near him Donât try to change your classes altogether That could hurt your grades and is not the best solution in the long run  If you do have to arrive at school early or stay late make sure you keep busy so youâre not alone for long periods of time Heâll be less likely to approach you if youâre working with a teacher especially   See if you can help out around the school Your librarian could probably use some assistance shelving or sorting books and thatâs the kind of thing that looks good on your college resume too   Not only will picking up a different hobby help you surround yourself with new people and avoid the guy but you may also find youâre so busy with a new passion you donât really care about the situation anymoreDo your research first and make sure itâs not a group the guy is already part of If itâs not a good time to join a new club see if there are any volunteer opportunities in your community you could be part of   A good way to change your schedule and your surroundings is to add new people to the mix Have you noticed someone eating alone at lunch Join them Or is there someone who seems to understand concepts in algebra that you just dont get Ask for help Making new friends puts you in situations away from your admirer and you might make longlasting bonds in the process   A new friend may also have good advice for how to avoid the guy   Popping up in the places where you know he usually hangs out sends the wrong message Try to stay away from areas where you can usually find him   Sometimes itâs unavoidable like if you both play the same sport or have similar schedules Dont skip school or give up your passions in an effort to avoid him If you must be in the same vicinity as each other stay focused on the task at hand   No matter how brave or persistent the guy seems your admirer is probably too shy to approach you when youâre in a big group of friends Try to avoid being alone   Always eat lunch with a group and try to go to the bathroom with a friend too Your friends may get tired of having to accompany you everywhere if they donât know why youâre asking them to do it Be sure to let them know about the situation
You want to know someone before you get romantic Think about why you like her so much  what sorts of experiences and conversations brought you together You want to both feel comfortable and friendly with each other If you establish a respectful and kind friendship with her she will be much more likely to like you back   Ask her on casual dates usually with other people Try to hang out outside of work or school occasionally to develop a connection If she doesnt seem interested in acting like friends or seems standoffish you should reconsider if she is someone you really want to spend a lot of time with  Youll need something to bond over so find things that you both enjoy It could be a hobby sport team movie musical style anything at all The only way youll build a relationship together is if you can build off of a conversation so get talking This will give you something to talk about but it will also show her that a relationship between the two of you could be fun   Hygiene is a sign that you care for yourself and therefore that youre willing and able to care for her Take a shower brush your hair use deodorant brush your teeth and generally try to be clean and tidy Wear your favorite shirt and put a comb through your hair This isnt just about her  it is about you Looking your best will help you feel your best   Dont neglect things like facial hair and fingernails Keep everything trim and tidy Smell fantastic but dont overdo it 12 spritz of cologne or body spray max Smiling is our way of expressing happiness and girls want to be with someone who is happy and carefree not someone who is sad and sulky The basics of strong body language are easy  head up spine straight and shoulders back Combined with a good smile these simple steps are proven to be the most effective form of flirting you have Dont blurt out the first thing in your head Slow down and take a breath before proceeding so you dont feel like a chicken with his head cut off Remember that you should feel nervous If you didnt you wouldnt really like her So feel confident in your decision and the butterflies in your stomach  theyre telling you that youve made the right decisionTry to slow down as you speak It will keep everyone you included much calmer Keep smiling Just the act of smiling actually makes you happier You dont have to write a script or poem or think of great jokes and stories In fact trying to manufacture the perfect tell is far too difficult and complicated for something that should come from the heart Visualize the conversation to get mentally ready but dont obsess over the details   I think youre awesome and I really like you What Im trying to say is I like you Do you want to go out on a date Hey ______ I dont usually go up to girls and say this but I really like you It may be more embarrassing for the both of you if other people are around and it puts pressure on her for a response Find a time and place where you are both relaxed happy and relatively alone Consider telling her I wanted to talk to you can we meet after school and just pick a place and a time Most girls prefer talking facetoface so try not to call her on the phone If you call her on the phone she might think that you arent confident enough to ask her in person   If the phone is the only way you can find yourself asking her then go for it Know however that youll always make a bigger impression in person Asking a friend to do it for you has a high chance of backfiring Again she might think you arent confident enough to tell her in person Dont tell her over IM or chat if at all possible Telling her to her face makes you seem more brave and confident but it also shows her that you respect her   Dont be anyone youre not Let the real you shine through because theres a much bigger chance shell like the real you than someone you pretend to be for her sake or someone elses   Dont be cheesy with her Try not to say anything too flirty because she might not know whether you actually mean it She might even think you were just teasing her trying to look cool or something etc and get upset at you Dont keep her guessing Be absolutely real and truthful Shell appreciate this more than anything Do not say anything stupid unless you are absolutely sure she is going to laugh Otherwise it just makes the situation more awkward for you If you think you can make her laugh at a good joke dont be afraid to work it in Girls love a sense of humor It shows her that you like having fun   Youre not talking to the ground so dont stare at it Looking her in the eyes has a way of telling her that youre completely focused on her and that she grabs your attention like no other person Plus itll give her a chance to stare into your eyes too and lots of girls think that the eyes are the most attractive part of the face   This wont get any easier unfortunately So just get out with it You dont need to look like Tom Cruise talk like Shakespeare or plan a wedding proposal  you just have to say I like you If youre struggling count to five in your head Tell yourself that no matter what youre going to say the words when you finish   I really like you I was hoping we could go on a date sometime Lets try to be more than friends While this is hard for you remember that youre dropping a pretty big bomb on her as well She needs time to think about your words and you asking questions or butting in doesnt help Even if she does like you back its not always easy to say that you like someone or maybe she hasnt really thought about it yet Dont force her to make a decision Instead ask her out on a date this allows her to find out whether she likes you if she doesnt already know   If she says yesLucky you Youre probably a pretty special person and she thinks that you have a lot to offer her At the very least shes interested in you and wants to get to know you better Have a game plan for a date or at least calling her or else you might make her wonder if youve reconsidered later   Dont be afraid to flirt with her a little When you say goodbye to her smile touch her lightly on the back and say Cool Im glad you said yes Ill call you about the movie Whats your number Once youve made the connection be sure to follow up on it a bit   Flirting is supposed to be subtle You really dont need to change that much about yourself other than the occasional physical contact and willingness to hold eye contact longer No need to over think it Remember girls sometimes move a little slower than guys so dont expect to be kissing her the next day If you get a chance to at the movies â or wherever you have the date â give her a little kiss but dont expect her to want to move as quickly as you might Remember youll probably get more of what you want by making her feel comfortable so be patient   You want to be a good friend otherwise the romance will fall to pieces Make sure you talk hang out and stay true to yourself and your other friends Just because she said yes doesnt mean you need to be smothering each other all of a sudden   Make time together at least once a week Plan dates together Continue seeing your friends and following your daily life  she fell for you not a puppy who only follows her around   Telling someone you like them is really really hard Not everyone has the strength to go through with it At the end of the day however you were open and honest enough to take a risk She might not have felt that connection but you better believe other women will Dont try to make her feel bad because shell get angry that youre doing that she wont suddenly like you even as a friend Remember people are attracted to happy playful funny people Try to look at life in a happy playful funny way even if it seems like theres no reason to at the moment   There is no beating around the bush  it will be awkward for a bit Give her time to get to know you better or to show her all you have to offer her You might have a chance with her in the future but you wont if youre super creepy about it If she feels like youre clingy or stalking her youre going to seriously hurt your chances Focus on being a good friend and dont make her feel like you have expectations   If she changes her mind about how she feels about you shell probably be more willing to make the first move so just wait it out You put yourself out there openly and honestly  you should be proud of yourself   If you dont think shell ever give you a chance let life show you who else is beautiful There are lots of people out there who you might be compatible with try to open your eyes to new possibilities Life is too short to chase after someone who doesnt see your merits If you are truly meant to be she will come back to you now that she knows you like her
Youve got this So act like it Dont slouch shy away from her mumble or refuse to meet her gaze Instead show her that youre comfortable with yourself and she can be comfortable with you too Make eye contact speak clearly and generally act like youre confident   If you look as appealing as possible you wont have to work quite so hard to convince her youre worth a kiss   Shave Or dont Most girls prefer a guy with a smooth face but some like their guys face rough Get to know what your girl likes Keep some mints handy Pop one whenever you feel your breath getting stale Try to be as generally clean as possible Take a shower put on some clean clothes and wear deodorant and if you want a bit of cologne   Many girls and women will not want to make out in front of others especially if this is her first kiss Find the right time when you can be alone Privacy is key   Watch carefully because sometimes the signals can be confusing  she may flirt with you then smack you on the head These may just be coy games or she may really be conflicted   Ask yourself these questions Did you and your date seem to have a cozy warm close time together Has she been flirting with you through body language Has she licked her lips or bit her lower lip while looking at you Has she found excuses to touch you often If you feel confident of these things prepare to kiss   If she is comfortable and doesnt look away then she is ready Lock eyes when youre talking to her when shes talking and during moments of silence   Starting with small physical contact tells her whats coming and gives her the chance to back out if shes uncomfortable Try these if youre not sure what to do   Put your arm around her shoulders Hold her hand Sweep her hair away from her face   Reach around her waist with one or both arms and gently draw her toward you If shes interested shell get the hint and move in if you feel her resist though back off   Do not squish her up against you and then grind your pelvis against her Do not use a first kiss as your personal excuse to grope grab or get too familiar Be a gentleman   Once shes close and youre pretty sure she wants to be kissed its time to seal the deal   Look into her eyes Notice how we mention eye contact twice Very important Let her know that you are really seeing her  Look at her lips Aim dude Make sure you know where youre going Lean in slowly and gently brush your lips over hers Dont worry about fancy technique or going quickly on the first few kisses â you can deal with that later   Your mouth should not be overly opened or closed and it shouldnt be mushy or too tight relax Dont let it go too long more than say 20 seconds or let it be too short 3 seconds is not enough  think around 10 seconds or so A tiny hint of tongue is nice if she seems willing but make it flirtatious and not insistent Check out How to Kiss for more technique tips   Just remain silent and hug her ending the first kiss in a lovely intimate moment
If youre going out with someone currently and a guy asks you out just politely say No thank you Im already dating someone   If youre not dating someone and a boy asks you out whom youre not interested in tell him youre very grateful that he asked but youre just not interested right now   If he is not your type be nice and say you dont feel a strong connection with him Liking someone for looks is a type of connection so dont flatout say that you dont want to date him because hes ugly Even though sometimes its hard to refrain from being brutally honest   If a guy gives you a note talk to him in person or give him your note reply in person If he calls you on the phone dont be afraid to speak to him The worse thing that you can possibly do is send a message through someone else it may lead him to feel embarrassed and next thing you know youre having odd runins around the neighborhood with unnamed person   Hopefully he isnt too persistent

Be honest with yourself and think How neat and selfcaring are you Do you take care of your body Dont be egotistical and selfcentered but do try your best to look good   Have a sense of fashion You donât have to be a topnotch fashionista but keeping your look uptodate and funky will most definitely help catch your crushs eye Looking fresh never hurt anybody Maybe pick one day a week to dress up a little bit but make it normal and not too forced Look decent and approachable If you wear dirty sloppy clothing your crush may not want to talk to you If you are going to buy some new items for your wardrobe make sure they are your style Figure out what matches your personality and accents your best points Make sure that you smell good and are clean You might want to try wearing a light perfume Have a distinct scent Wear perfumecologne put on deodorant brush your teeth and chew gum   People want to be with people who seem happy and fun not grouchy and negative Your attitude can go a long way   The person you have your eye on is more likely to be kind if you have open posture smile and welcome them warmly either by waving or smiling mischievously Act happy to see someone but not so happy they think that youre stalking them Animals do this to human beings all the time They act happy to see you and people become happy to see them People even look forward to seeing them It really works Try to be nice to everyone and dont say bad things about other people What goes around comes around They will notice how you treat other people Ego and arrogance is never appealing Be associated with positive things Donât change who you are or make excuses Game playing and people who shapeshift to become someone they arenât will turn people off People like a bit of mystery and they are drawn to confident people   Have a life outside of them The more you do the more interesting you become The more interesting you become the more intrigued your crush will become about you Whether itâs your body shape or your witty comebacks you have a strong suit Figure it out and once you do work on bringing it out If you have to change yourself to get your crush to like you theyre probably not worth it Most crushes dont last more than four months and someone better might come along
Dont sleep with people on your first date  especially if theres any idea that this is not your perfect match Dating is meant to give you a chance to talk and get to know someone you dont have to have sex Frankly most people can tell within a few minutes whether they are interested enough for a second date  if this is the case with you dont even offer a kiss goodnight Keep things very platonic and nice but dont allow it to escalate into sexual action of any kind This makes it much harder to later convince the hardheaded that you really are not interested  You may not think this person is a match for you but she is a human being whose only crime was being interested enough in you to want to get to know you better Bear this in mind even if you found this person boring overly introverted too fixated on hisher hobby or just not compatible   Maybe this person was an arrogant obnoxious boor If this person was a jerk when you were on your date remember that this is the last time you will have to talk with himher Theres no need to make an enemy  just be direct and dont get hostile   Your phone rings  its himher This is not the time for prevaricating wavering Dont let it go to voice mail  answer it Dont give in to the temptation to say things like Sure Id love to do it again sometime  call me next week You think its harmless and vague enough not to matter but its not Thats a lie and its wrong If youre lucky heshe is calling to say thanks for a nice evening and nothing more If thats the case you need not say anything more than Youre welcome Thank you too However if she is calling for another date go on to the next step   Just say I think that youre a great guygirl Youre just not MY great guygirl I know your great mate is out there Good luck to you If she tries to persuade you to give it just one more chance its up to you of course but if youve already made up your mind just say Im sorry but I dont think we have enough in common for a longterm relationship Thanks though Thats firm  and final  and leaves no room for doubt as to where your head is at   Wavering because you feel sorry for someone is not a good idea Many times this person is a friend of a friend Your mutual friend tells you how upset this person is that things didnt work out and how shed really like another chance Maybe heshe has even been crying or is incessantly begging your friend to work on you trying to get another shot with you Its fine to feel compassion about hisher pain rejection is never easy But giving in to another date will only compound the error and you will go through it all over again after the next one Stay firm in your resolve and tell your friend Its great there is a friend like you who is so kind and cares so much about hisher happiness The thing is it would just make things worse Its not that heshe isnt a good person its just that were not a match Lets leave it at that If your friend persists say Youre a good friend but its not going to happen Tell himher that I said good luck and lets drop it Now
You donât necessarily have to accuse your boyfriend of cheating but tell him that you feel like something is off with him Being unable to communicate with your partner can cause significant problems in a relationship so itâs best to just confront the issue directly  Make sure to choose a time to talk with your boyfriend when you know you wonât be interrupted If you want to have a serious honest conversation neither of you should be taking phone calls or answering textsTry to stay as calm as possible If you immediately put your boyfriend on the defensive youâre probably not going to get any real answers Remember that your goal is a conversation not a confrontation You donât want to come across as irrational or paranoid so it helps to cite the specific evidence thatâs led you to suspect him even if itâs just the fact that heâs stopped calling you pet names or always takes his phone into the bathroomFor the best results you should be as nonjudgemental as possible when youâre laying out the reasons that youâve come to suspect your boyfriend of cheating so try to start your sentences with âIâ and not âyouâ For example you might say âI feel like weâre growing apart and Iâm upset about itâ That can make your boyfriend more likely to listen to what you have to say If explaining the changes in your boyfriends behavior that concern you doesnt lead to the topic coming up you may want to just ask him directly if hes cheating Youre probably going to be angry and upset but dont resort to name calling or physical violence The calmer you stay the more likely you are to get a straight answer from your boyfriendGive you boyfriend a chance to answer your questions Dont yell at him or assume you know what hes going to say He may have an explanation for his actions that will relieve your fears   Unless you have ironclad proof that heâs cheating your boyfriend is most likely going to deny whatever accusations you level at him In that situation you have to listen to your instincts If you really feel like you canât believe what heâs telling you then the trust is already broken in your relationship and that can be difficult to bounce back from
If you decide to ask her how she feels about you figure out what you want first Do you just want to sleep with her one time and never speak again or are you in love with her If you donât have genuine feelings for her it is probably not worth your time or her time to try to pursue her If you genuinely like her then it might be worth asking her how she feels about you  Donât just jump right into asking her how she feels about you First flirt with her you to show her you are interested Be yourself and joke around with her Give her compliments and ask her about herself Smile when you see her and make eye contact Try to break the touch barrier with her by finding an excuse to brush against her or touch her arm Be sincere and not fake  If you feel like you have established a connection with her and feel confident that she might like you back ask her how she feels This can be stressful and nerveracking but worth it to finally have a clear answer Be confident but also be understanding that this is a delicate situation and you might be putting her in an awkward spot Even if she has been flirting with you it does not mean she must not love her boyfriend   Try saying something like âI know you have a boyfriend  and I donât want to get in the way of that  but I just wanted you to know that I have developed feelings for you I completely understand that you are committed to someone else but I want you to know that if you werenât I would want to date youâ Give her plenty of time to think about what you tell her and to navigate her feelings   If she says she is not interested then she is not interested Leave her alone and let her be happy with her boyfriend Continuing to pursue her is rude and disrespectful Give her however much space she wants or that you need to get over her If you are both comfortable with it continue to be her friend
Since youve never been kissed you may find it difficult to read your girls nonverbal cues   A few prompts would be   I really want to kiss you right now I want to show you just how much you mean to me Can I kiss you goodnight
Unless shes too full of herself shes not aware that you think shes special because normally women arent scanning to see who wants them Dont approach women like a salesman trying to close a deal but rather with the attitude of trying to be friendly and pass the time  If you feel nervous imagine you two are locked in the room and theres nothing else to do So talk Always start with hello what is your name this is a good opening because its honest You want to know her name so you asked If she doesnt want to tell you her name or seems timid then some lighthearted playful questioning will show her that theres nothing to fear arent you gonna ask me my name or Nice name is there a story behind it or you look like a Stacey dont you think the goofier and dumber you think you sound the less timid shell become around you   All youre doing here is relating She says something you think about a similar experience and tell her about it Keep it short and let her ask you about it if she wants to know more EX I love music Im always going to concerts then you could say never been to a concert sounds fun though or what kind of music do you like Again keep it honest you dont have to like what she likes or be into the same stuff   Eventually they begin to feel more like people instead of girl and once you can see them as people it becomes easy to just say hi Once you take the intimidation out of it you can see more easily as to how she feels Maybe what you once saw as a girl thats not interested was actually too nervous to talk to you Then you can say the things youd want to hear to calm her nerves On the other hand she might be comfortable talking to you and enjoys the attention Either way theres no shame in wanting to get to know someone
Even if youre shy talking to your crush can be really easy Just treat himher like a good friend  Dont run up like youre a crazed fan Try to meet him or her as casually as possible If one of your friends knows your crush ask to be introduced This way the meeting will seem very friendly and not too out of the ordinary   If youre really uncomfortable talking to your crush and you have a friend that knows himher bring your friend along and ask your friend to do most of the talking Use your friend to your advantage Get your friend to talk about you to your crush and use himher to help get a conversation going   Its not that difficult to say your own name  just try not to get tonguetied Remember that this crush of yours is a normal person like you and there is no real reason to get nervous   If you need an excuse to meet your crush go up and say that you heard that heshe needed help with for example some math homework Give your name and phone number and let himher know you are willing to help This is also a good excuse to see himher again after your first meeting   This works especially well if your crush is a girl since girls love compliments But even guys like to be complimented on things like their shirt or their shoes This will start your relationship on a good note   Its can be hard to get a conversation going when you first meet someone If youve already broken the ice by giving a compliment build on that Follow up with questions and comments like Where did you get those shoes Oh really Ive been there before Its a great place If you dont feel ready to have a conversation skip to the next step   If you both have cell phones ask to exchange phone numbers You can also ask them if they have are on Facebook Twitter MSN Google or whatever other social networking site you use This will show that youre interested in staying in touch with them   Dont rush off like you have something better to do but dont just stand there in awkward silence either When you feel that youve said enough or if things are taking an awkward turn find a casual realistic reason to say goodbye If youre talking between classes say you have to go to class If youre not say you have to get going someone is waiting for you Add a See you later to top it off This will hint that youd like to meet and talk again
Staring at himher wont do anything They or someone else could catch you in the act If possible stop your habit of staring at them Or just make sure no one including them is watching and just quickly sideglance at them  Theyll think youre creepy   Especially someone with a reputation for being a gossipbig mouth and untrustworthy If you dont feel one hundred percent sure someone wont use it against you dont tell You never know when you will fight with someone They might use blackmail You dont want it   This might be a good way to tell someone youve got a crush on someone without letting anyone know Except if someone reads it If you are embarrassed about your crush this can be a good way of looking at it objectively   Dont confirm your crush to anyone else They will go back and tell your crush   Be polite but not overly attentive If you tag along with them too much theyll be annoyed or someone else will find out that you like himher But then again you dont want to be too shy around them either They might consider you weird or be suspicious   If your special someone ends up liking you you want this person to fall for who you really are not someone you pretended to be

It might be scary or intimidating but put all of your thoughts and feelings on the table If you really like this boy tell her If heâs hinted or flat out told you that he returns those feelings tell her While it may hurt your friend at first it will feel worse if she feels like youâve lied or left her in the darkThis is especially important if this is a very close friend that you share everything with If you start a relationship with this guy secretly she will automatically be distrustful or resentful of it and you could really hurt her feelings  When you have a crush on someone and the feeling is returned it feels pretty awesome however try to imagine or remember what itâs like when those feelings arenât returned Recognize that your friend may feel really down in the dumps and take care not to gloat or shove your happiness in her faceWhen you are with her remember that its okay to talk about your crush but dont let him be the only thing you talk about If she is hurt the crush might be a sore topic   You need to decide this before going into the conversation Itâs entirely up to you to decide how to proceed in this situation You can tell her that you really like this guy you want to date him but you wonât go forward with it unless you have her blessing Alternatively you can tell her that you plan on pursuing a relationship with him and youâd like her support   Evaluate the consequences both good and bad of dating your crush before you decide what to do Think about how this might impact your relationship with your friend and if you like this guy enough to risk straining harming or even ending your friendship Is this just a casual crush or someone you can see getting serious with Think about your friends personality â does she have a hard time moving on from things Is she the type who would see this as a betrayal or be sad for a little while and then bounce backWeigh the pros and cons of pursuing this relationship so you can go into the conversation with your friend with eyes wide open If you tell your friend that you will not date him unless sheâs comfortable with it you need to stick to that Keep in mind that if your friend disapproves of your relationship it can cause a major strain on itAt the end of the day it is your life If you want to date your crush with or without your friendâs approval you can however you should be prepared for the consequences to your friendship You can still be caring toward your friend even if you decide to date your crush without her approval You could say âI really care about you and our friendship and Iâm excited about possibly dating John I hope that you can eventually be happy for me I will not let my dating life get in the way of our friendshipâ   Whether she is angry upset or jealous she is still your friend You do not have to change your plans based on her emotions and you do not have to agree with everything she says but you should be a kind personRemember she is probably hurt that her crush has chosen you Be gentle honest and loving while she heals from rejection   This is particularly important if sheâs been a longterm loyal friend Your crush may be really great but your friend is too Itâs OK and human to want relationships with both but take care not to neglect your friend for this guy   If youâve told your friend how you feel you might as well clue him in too While sometimes a crush consists of flirting and subtle hints it will make the situation easier on everyone if you know where your crush standsFor example thereâs no need to do damage control on your friendship if you discover he likes someone else   Once both of your feelings are out in the open you are able to decide how to proceed   In other words donât betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about her She may like him and she may be hurt â but that doesnât mean he needs to know that Talk to your crush about your own feelings and let your friend keep hers private if she wishesYour friend will be hurt and embarrassed if she discovers youâve been airing her dirty laundry to a boy she has feelings for   A good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself Talk only about your own feelings and desires not anyone elseâs   If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship take your time Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything A slow and steady start can make for a healthy solid relationship tooThat doesnât mean you need to lie to your friend and pretend that things arenât happening with your crush It just means letting her cope with the situation at a slower pace If your crush doesnât respect or understand your need to take things slowly he may not be the right guy for you after all   Just because your friend has given her approval that probably doesnât mean she wants to see you holding hands or kissing all the time Respect her enough to keep your PDA and pet names to a minimum in her presence If you want to call your boyfriend Hot Lips and sit on his lap in private thatâs your prerogative Your friend doesnât need to see that though On that note your friends who never had a crush on him probably donât want to see that either so keep the PDA to a minimum Donât neglect your friend in order to spend all your time with this boy A new relationship can be exciting and itâs easy to want to spend all your time with your crush however you need to show your friend that you value your friendship and arenât going anywhereIf your friend tries to pull away because of hurt feelings give her space but let her know that you cherish your friendship You âwonâ the guy so be loving and gracious with your friend Until sheâs solidly moved on just bite your tongue when it comes to that kind of conversation It will only seem like youâre rubbing her face in your good fortune and it could make her resentful Enjoy your relationship privately and separate it from your friendship â at least for awhile

away   If youre not ready to complete lose this stuff then put it in a box at least Put it somewhere you wont be able to see it for a few weeks Give it to a friend for safekeeping if necessary   Get your friends together and talk about how youre feeling You dont need to solve your problem but talking about it honestly and openly is a good way to start the healing process   Be indulgent Eat chocolate and watch sappy movies together Talk about your crappy relationship and support each other No shame Alternatively sometimes you might just want to be alone for a while Thats fine Theres no one perfect way to get over a guy Do what feels natural to you   Sit down with some paper and pencil or pen Write his name at the top of the page Pour yourself a drink get a box of tissues and just start writing Pour out everything that youre feeling everything that youre angry about onto the page Address it to him Really let him have it Then tear up the letter or burn it or throw it away Dont even give him the satisfaction   Use your body and your mind to do positive things instead of mope If youre feeling depressed and obsessing over a guy try to work on yourself instead Exercising helps

Fruit Loops in your ugly pajamas do it Nobodys going to judge that Celebrate the fact that youre single That thing he always hated to do Yeah do that thing And enjoy it   The moping around and being sad is an essential part of getting over a guy Dont let anyone tell you otherwise But it shouldnt last forever Eventually youve got to be the one who says This is enough Decide when youve had it and when its time for you to get better Then move on   Good rule of thumb Dont grieve a relationship for more days than months you were together If you went out for a year its ok to be sad for a couple weeks But eventually youve got to get over it Eventually all the sadness will just get boring Decide you want something more Decide you want to be happy   Do something little but that feels big for

You may prefer to let down an acquaintance gently but be very clear that you are saying no Say only what is true and dont feel required to offer them extra details You can offer reasons but dont elaborate to make them feel better They just need to hear that you are turning them downSay for instance I value your friendship Im not interested in pursuing anything else with you Im not interested and its not okay that you asked You know Im in a monogamous relationship Im flattered but Id rather not get involved with a coworker   When you say no be clear about the fact that this is a closed topic If you need them to treat you differently now that theyve come on to you say this as wellI dont want you to ask me again If you do I will not feel comfortable around you and I will not want to spend time together anymore I am going to tell my partner Dont give me a hard time about that If you keep harassing me Ill tell the rest of our friends as well We can talk about this eventually but Id rather you not bring it up at work If you do I will feel violated and I will have to tell someone to protect myself   If your acquaintance crosses a line you set enact the consequences you promised If you dont your acquaintance will continue to cross your linesRefuse to attend gatherings at which this person is present Do not hang out or offer friendship to someone who harasses you and makes you feel uncomfortable Report the interactions to HR if they happen at work   If this is happening repeatedly and you have made it clear that you want it to stop you are being harassed This is unacceptable and you should do what you need to do to feel safe Tell mutual friends and refuse to attend events at which your aggressor is also present Explain your reasons to the host   If its happening at work report to your supervisor and to HR and take it higher up if nobody is helping you If its happening at school tell your teacher the principal and your friends Get a restraining order if you are being contacted or visited against your will
Its best to have the conversation in person especially if the guy is a friend This way you can make sure theres no confusion and address any questions he might have Make sure you pick a solid time and place to talkThere is no good time to tell someone youre not interested as the conversation will always be somewhat sad However you may not want to tell the guy right before a stressful work or school day You may want to wait for say a weekend when hes not busy Pick a place that does not seem datelike Going out to breakfast for example may feel like a date Instead you could tell him you want to talk to him and invite him to a nonromantic public place like a lowkey coffee shop  While facetoface is usually ideal in some cases its not the best idea If the guy has been aggressively pursuing you and making you uncomfortable send a text rejection You can email him or text him youre not interested This will save you from dealing with a potential outburst on his endYou should only do this if you feel the guy will get hostile In most cases its best to talk facetoface   It can be nerveracking to spill your feelings to someone so spend some time thinking about your words You can even write down your feelings and then read over your notes to try to figure out how to best phrase your feelingsTry practicing saying your words a few times before meeting up with him This way you can deliver the news in a calm collected fashion   You want to be direct but not brutal Make it clear youre not interested in him romantically but that you still value him Romantic rejection is always hard so try to reject him kindlyStart off with a compliment that does not sound flirtatious Say something I do think youre a really nice person but or I have fun hanging out with you but Then quickly let the guy know youre not interested For example But I just dont see you as more than a friend Im sorry You can give a reason if you want For example Youre just not my type or I think we would want different things out of a relationship   Sometimes there may be a specific reason youre rejecting someone However its not always best to be brutally honest If you dont know this person well theyre unlikely to change troublesome behaviors just because you ask them to and it may result in them getting hostile For example if you dont want to go on a second date with a guy because he talked too much this information may not be worth sharing If you were close before the guy developed feelings you probably want to maintain that friendship However sometimes guys feel you will eventually come around if they stay friends with you If you want to remain friends make it very clear that you only want thatSay something like I want to stay friends but only friends I dont want you harboring false hope Im going to come around and see you romantically If the guy does not seem to be getting the hint you may have to lessen contact or become more casual friends   At first the guy may be hurt at the rejection The two of you may want to reduce contact for a set period of time This way he can have time to cope with his feelings of rejection Being around you too much after being rejected may make it hard for him to move on Some guys may not take the hint Even if you think youve been clear you may find some men still ask you out or flirt with you If necessary remind them on occasion Say something like We talked about this I just want to be friends If a guy does not leave you alone after you reject him cut off contact Its not appropriate to keep badgering someone for a romance if theyve made it clear theyre not interested Stop returning texts and phone calls and get rid of him on social media The sooner you tell a guy youre not interested the better If you sense a guy is interested in you address as soon as possible Letting it linger will only strengthen the guys feelings making the inevitable conversation more difficult Some people prefer to simply gradually cut off contact from a guy You may slowly stop returning texts and phone calls and hope the guy takes the hint If you only met the guy recently and only had a few dates this technique is usually appropriate However when dealing with a friend who likes you a more direct confrontation is important   If you know the guy or if hes part of your social circle do not avoid the situation If you know he has feelings for you simply avoiding him can only last for so long Its best to address the situation rather than avoiding it altogether
If you tend to dress like a slob ex wrinkled baggy untucked shirt baggy pants dirty sneakers see what else you have in your wardrobe that may be more presentable High class girls like boys who dress decently and neatly but they must also have the ability to sweep them off their feet Suggestions for clothing may be   A nice fitting shirt that complements your face hair eyes etc       A nice fitting pair of pants that doesnt look off jeans are also another option but it depends on what kind of girl youre dealing with here Combed hair it doesnt have to look like you spent an hour on it but messy bed hair may not be appealing to high class girls A decent pair of shoes it doesnt have to be dress shoes but make sure your shoes arent scruffy and dirty looking The way you dress will depend on the preferences of the high class girl youre trying to win If she tends to dress more casually you can be a little more casual However if she dresses extravagantly and formally you may have to lessen the casual look and go more for the formal look but not too much  High class girls tend to look down on bad words lazy vocabulary and pretty much any styles of talking that sound dirty low class and unruly Listen to how your crush talks and try to talk like she does but not so much that you sound like an exact replica of her Pick up words from her here and there and dust up your vocabulary Refrain from cursing or doing any bad talk in front of her and definitely keep away from dirty andor perverted jokes   If you plan on telling her jokes only tell her a couple that you know are uproariously funny to everyone not just to your friends Practice telling your jokes to other high class girls to see if they laugh if they dont you may have to rethink your jokes before presenting them to your crush         Confidence goes a long way If you appear shy and nervous in front of her the chances of her being impressed by you will be extremely low However if you talk clearly  not too loudly or it will annoy her  and appear confident in who you are she will be interested and want to know you more Speak up and dont be afraid of who you are   Avoid practicing what youre going to say in front of her as you will sound like you had prepared it You will also sound mechanical and lifeless almost like a parrots words Your conversations with her should be casual and flowing not like stiff and resembling an interview         High class girls dislike these types of boys Remember to never try to be extremely cool High class girls understand that you are not meant to be theirs   Start a conversation with a girl who knows your crush and converse with her about your crush Tell that girl that you like your crush  she could act as a common friend   Never go and talk to your crush until that common friend introduces you to her         Remember not to have personal talks with her that are direct Either ask her about her hobbies her favorite color try to converse about what you two have in common and so on Slowly you will see that you two are sharing a good bond with each other   However make the question casual  ask her in the middle of a comfortable conversation and dont ask for all her personal information at once Otherwise she will see you as desperate and perhaps creepy   Dont forget to give her your email address phone number etc       Avoid asking for her address at this point She may think youre trying to stalk her Dont ask for all this information at once If your crush wishes to tell let her If not move onto the next step or wait a while before asking again However dont be pushy or whiny   Meet with her or say hi whenever she sees you Always keep smiling but not too much or creepily preferably when youre with your friends so that it attracts her attention   Try to be or talk with other girls a little so that she will become a little jealous You will notice the change in her   Say yes if you have time Otherwise politely decline and say Maybe another time Im busy after school   If you always accept it creates an image for the boy next door         If she says no do not get frustrated Only say Okay Maybe another time Always make eye contact with her and do not be shy Girls dont like to talk to shy boys You should be confident while asking her so that she is not able to easily say no   Tell her that you like her If she says that she feels the same way great Before starting a relationship with her tell her about your reality and that you are a middle class boy  not a high class boy If she accepts you the way you are she really does love you   You two can still be friends and she may realize in the future that she does love you There are plenty of girls out there and the perfect one for you is waiting in the world  you have to let go of your crush for now in order to find her It will be worth it   Dont put yourself down because of this but dont get cocky either
More often than not your friends will find pleasure in ruffling your feathers Let your outer image exude confidence and nonchalance about their banter and teasingIf they see that you arent phased by their silly teasing they wont bother doing it anymore   Be as cool about the situation as you can Even if you may feel uneasy about your friends teasing on the inside your confidence and carefree attitude will show them that their words andor actions wonât throw you off your crushing game Deflect with humor if youâre having difficulty with ignoring your friendsâ teasing Come up with a witty phrase or comeback that lets your friends know that their teasing is nothing more than a laughing matter   Your friends donât need to know everything that goes on between you and your crush Avoid giving your friends too much teasing ammo and pull back the reigns on over sharing A little mystery goes a long way   Your friends will still more than likely bug you about spilling the beans about you and your crush Share only the details that youâre comfortable with sharing You could even tell them that you dont have a crush on the person anymore   Playing it cool might mean spending more time with people who respect you Teasing might seem like its all in good fun but it stops being fun with it begins to hurt Find people to hang with who are mature enough to leave you along when youve asked nicely   As a last resort you could even tell your friends that you dont want to spend time with them anymore because of their behavior If your friends apologize and want to earn back your trust its up to you whether you want to give them another chance It could be a learning experience for both you and your friends If you feel that the teasing has gone past the point of playfulness and into bullying territory tell your parents or another trusted adult You deserve to be treated well by your peers so dont be afraid to seek help if you need it
If he is flirting with another girl a lot then dont care It might hurt inside but assume that you are the most attractive person on this earth and that you can get any guy Confidence makes guys melt  Got a Facebook Make it obvious to the player that you are interested in someone else only if they show the interest in return Write on their walls exchange gifts etc People look at everyones stuff on Facebook at some point   Plan things Do stuff with friends   Have other guys notice you and notice them Make the whole thing a game Players are difficult to deal with and no one wants you to get hurt   Act in your comfort zone and dont change for anyone else except around the player and some of his friends Dont ever give in to the player and dont betray any of your friends They are there for you and if you are a good friend they will be there in return   Take special moments to get close to him and right after seem like there is no connection Be nice but at the same time seem like you have no idea that you are not giving the player the attention he wants Players live off of attention They would not survive if they did not get the attention they wanted Seem interested in him but when the time comes be nice but uninterested at the same time Talk to other guys flirt with other guys especially   Do not do things that all players want from girls but seem interested ever so slightly   Will he play you or have you reeled him in Do not do the things that all players want girls to do Wait a couple of weeks see what he does and how to work with each other If you want a relationship with this guy you need to judge if he is really capable of that If you just wanted to play this fool forget about him and dont talk to him anymore He will probably feel the same way girls have felt when he used them
Weigh your options and decide if you really want to pursue this girl Going after a girl with a boyfriend is frowned upon but it happens Make sure you actually like this girl and not the idea of her Sometimes the unattainable can spark desires but before you do anything be sure you like her Be honest with your feelings  Look her up on social media websites like Facebook or Twitter See if you share interests Imagine if you can really picture yourself with this person Talk to someone who knows her If youre unsure if she has a boyfriend ask someone who knows her better than you do   Dont stalk this girl in real life Its only acceptable to look into her internet presence   Youll need to be realistic with your wishes Are you in her social circle If shes always hanging out and making eyes at the football captain and youre kind of a gamerbookish dude or vice versa Its just not going to happen regardless of what magazine articles TV shows or movies may want you to believe Youve got to be at least on her radar This process could take years Nobody knows how long a couple will stay together The only ones who do know are the people dating and usually if theyre young they have no idea   Throughout your pursuit dont limit yourself to only this girl There is a high chance that she will stay with her partner It is not healthy to hold onto the idea of someone without giving anyone else a shot   Whenever you begin strong feelings towards a girl youll typically develop more energy than usual Try to use this energy as a creative force Write songs or poems Draw or paint whatever is in your head This will also give you something to show off when youre ready to reveal this to your crush   Once you understand what type of friend clique she is in you should have an idea of the type of style she likes Dont go overboard with changing your appearances You need to put effort into your appearance but not too much effort   Dont change for a girl Plenty of guys do this and its not a terrible reason to change but you shouldnt do it Try focus on the qualities you think she would like about you Accentuate these attributes about yourself Younger girls typically like guys who are older and taller than them Being in shape and having a good sense of humor are also positive traits for attracting a girl Weigh your chances of this girl being attracted to you When you start to develop a crush on someone forbidden you should stay physically active There is a chance of you becoming depressed and anxious at home Staying active will help curb these feelings and keep your feelings in reality If you see her around make sure you say hi even if youre with your friends or parents If youve never talked before this could be weird for her If you feel uncomfortable speaking to her smile at her in passing This should be a slow process The goal is to try to truly make friends with the people your crush is friends with Fake friends are no good Go for the people you wouldnt mind hanging out with   Careful making friends with her girl friends They could get the wrong idea and develop feelings for your This could also spark an interest from the girl you like Gauge the situation   Once she notices you and you actually have similar friends you should talk to her Dont flirt with her when you first start talking Be genuine and try to be funny but let it come out naturally Talk about the things you know she likes Share with her your opinions on whatever it is she cares aboutGetting into a serious conversation about your interests is good and should create an impression   Add her on Facebook and Twitter after youve already had a conversation about something Now shell be faced at home with the thought of you Like one of her recent status or a profile picture to show that youve took time to look at her page   Start to hang out with her outside of school or college Invite her and her friends to join you and your friends Make it a group oriented affair at first Dont ask her to hang out alone or she may feel uncomfortable   It helps if there is an event that you are both going to Be as casual as possible and dont make it seem like you are desperate Be smooth and try to appear innocent   Slowly but surely start to talk with her a little more each day Try to talk as much as you can without being overbearing A little communication will deepen the friendship and potentially open more feelings to develop Find out from her if she is happy with the way things are going in her relationship Talk about the actual relationship with her and not just about her boyfriend She might appreciate the chance to talk about things This will also drop a hint to her that you are interested   Dont be crude when you talk about another person Youre introducing thoughts about being attracted to girls This is obvious but if you talk about girls who are a similar type as her she might pay attentionIf she is slightly interested she might become a little jealous by this This can seem like a counter productive technique but youre simply trying to add more attention to yourself   Just dont make it obvious Eye contact is a powerful agent in attraction When appropriate try to touch her shoulder in order to get her attention She could become very uncomfortable by this Gauge her response and dont over do it   This can be a tough move to make or it could feel like the most natural one Once youve laid the ground work for the big move you need to talk to her Be honest with both yourself and especially to her Pick a time when you are both alone Let her know that she doesnt have to do anything she doesnt want to do   Tell her that you still want to be friends no matter what she decides Even if she isnt ready to be with you now she could come around if youre available   If all her friends start acting cold towards you youre probably not welcome to hang out anymore Gauge the situation based on her body language and what she tells you Most people are flattered to learn someone likes them Other people can become creeped out by this especially if theyre in a committed relationship Going for a girl who is taken can be controversial but if you think she might like you too its OK to try After all shes free to choose what she wants to do even if right now she has a boyfriend Think about interactions youve had with her Did she give you reason to think shes romantically interested If so as they say alls fair in love and war   However make sure you arent interpreting friendliness as romantic interest Just because shes nice to you doesnt mean she wants to break up with her boyfriend for you You should also consider your relationship with her boyfriend If youre friends with him you might want to consider his girlfriend offlimits out of respect   Maybe shes not in an exclusive relationship with her boyfriend Lots of people date more than one person at once so this could be an option shes open to Its still good to make sure shes interested in you though before you go too far Even if shes open to dating around she may not see you that way   Girls dont particularly like to be asked out after theyve turned someone down  especially if they already have a boyfriend Even flirting constantly could annoy her If she seems happy with her boyfriend let her stay that way The best you can hope for is becoming her friend
Its the most simple reflex in the human body When you take a deep breath your body automatically relaxes Being relaxed is a good way to show your crush that youre a calm and relaxed person Everyone likes to hang around with someone whos cool as a cucumber In through your nose out through your mouth  Unless the occasion is somber put a smile on your face like youre enjoying whats going on around you and are engaged in the conversation If youre alone a content look will suffice This also makes you look relaxed   If your crush says something humorous laugh Dont laugh at every word that comes out of hisher mouth just when heshe cracks a joke or double entendre   This is a given No one wants to be around someone who smells Take a bath or shower everyday and wear deodorant If youre a girl wearing a little makeup is good but not a necessity   In order to have a friend be a friend This almost always is the case You want to befriend your crush but at the same time try to avoid the friendtrap This is where you get so close in a friendship risking it for a relationship wouldnt be advisable Be close and hang out but not too often unless you know heshe likes you too   Not to your friends not on your Facebook or Myspace To the girlguy you like It may be awkward But thats part of the magic
This one is a giveaway If you look across the room in class or at a party and catch her looking right at you then she may have a crush on you If she sees that youve noticed her staring and looks away and blushes or gives you a little smile then she may be acknowledging that she may like you   Just dont be too obvious about trying to catch her staring at you or she may think that youre the one staring at her  This is another sign that she may have a crush on you If every time you walk by or talk to her you find her turning red or getting flustered then this may be a sign that she likes you and is shy and embarrassed about talking to you or saying the wrong thing If you do see her blushing dont tease her about it or mention it or that may scare her off from talking to you   Just make sure shes not the kind of girl who blushes whenever she talks to any guy  she could just be shy around guys   A lot of girls giggle a lot around the guys they like because crushes make them feel a bit giddy and lightheaded just for being around the guy that they like If you find the girl always giggling or laughing a lot around you even if youve barely said anything funny then she may like you She could just be feeling giggly because she likes you or she could really think that everything you say is funny because she has a big crush on you   Next time you talk to her see how much she laughs Try a small joke and see if she laughs way too much  this may mean that she has feelings for you   A girls friends can tell you a lot about how she feels about you without saying much Next time the girl walks by with her friends in the halls see if the friends giggle when they see you elbow her or just nod in your direction trying to tell the girl that youre around This is a notsosubtle way of letting you know that the girl may have a crush on you   If the girls friends always greet you with a knowing smile then they may be telling you that the girl likes you   If the girl has a crush on you then she may want to be around you as much as possible If she likes you she may be looking for excuses to hang out like asking for help with her math homework or even asking you to see a movie or to go to a concert with you She could be very casual when she asks you to hang out to hide the fact that she likes you   If youre in the same social circle but shes been around a lot more lately then it may be because she has a crush on you   If the girl dresses up a bit more whenever shes around you and pays more attention to her hair and makeup then she may be trying to impress you If youre just hanging out with her or hanging out in a small group but she spends a lot of time putting on lipstick or lip balm looking at herself in the mirror or just fidgeting with her clothes then she may be trying to impress you   If you see her unexpectedly and shes dressed down a lot more then she may be dressing up to impress you If you see her at the grocery store or somewhere unexpected and she makes a joke about how casual she looks then she may be embarrassed that shes not more dressed up for you   The girls body language can say a lot about how she feels about you If shes always making eye contact leaning closer to you and turning her body to you when you talk then she may like you Here are some other things to look for   If she plays with her hair when she talks to you then this may mean that shes nervous because she likes you If she shifts her weight from foot to foot she may be a bit nervous about talking to you too If she breaks eye contact and looks at the floor once in a while it may be because she likes you   This is an important point You may think the girl likes you but it could turn out that shes flirty talkative and playful around many guys Some girls just have a lot of crushes on guys at once or just like hanging out with guys  some even prefer hanging out with guys to hanging out with girls You may be misreading the signs and thinking a really friendly girl has a crush on you   Check out how the girl acts around other guys If shes the same way with everyone then its just part of her personality If she treats you differently however and pays more attention to you  or less attention because she feels shy about talking to you  then she may have a crush on you
Girl like when boys make the first move If you initiate conversation then shell be all the more willing to keep it up even if she doesnt have a crush on you  Try to be a little flirty all the time too   Dont underestimate the power of withdrawal If she flirts flirt back but keep it short and leave her wanting more Dont make yourself so easy to get that she becomes uninterested   Hint to someone close to her that youre interested Theyre bound to tell the girl youre eyeing Dont make it seem desperate though You may find out if she already likes you from a mutual friend If she does your work is easy Just let her chase you   In case you didnt know girls like that However dont let her EXPECT the compliments then its you doing the chasing Also be sure to compliment the right things If you dont know the girl well just talking about how hot she is will make her think youre just interested in the physical stuff and you dont want that   Be cool Let her see you have a social life but dont be cocky about it and dont try too hard to be busy or it will show   Be slightly distant without being rude Treat em mean keep em keen DOESNT work Many girls will become confused and hurt if you try this and may lose interest all together   Ask her out on a group thing but spend a lot of time with her Shell think of it as a date subconsciously if she spends most of the night talking to you   Describe an ideal girlfriend using a lot of the qualities that the girl youre talking to has Dont come right out and say it but by dropping hints shell begin to think of herself as a good fit for you   Overall once youve established yourself as a usual person she talks to ease back a bit Dont ignore her entirely just try play it cool Once she realizes you havent spoken in a while shell be missing you then shell start messaging you first and seeking you out Hence chasing you From then on flirt sweet talk and play it hot and cold itll keep her constantly looking for approval and attention for you but youll hold the power Just remember not to stay too distant or she may think youre too hard to get
Dont ask their friends but go to the source Ask the crush or the relative Sending an email asking them is always good If they arent then no sweat  If your crush has already asked them to be their girlfriend or boyfriend or they have gone out more than one time then time to take action If its only a one off thing then wait a few weeks and see what happens before you do anything drastic   Even if you are upset dont get depressed Keep in mind that even if you had gone out with your crush it probably would have been over in a few weeks There are always more fish in the sea you can find other people you like   Itll be stressful watching the pair of them together and you have to be a strong person to do that   Itll bring you a lot less pain but do not completely blank them both out Otherwise theyll wonder what they did to you   Howeverdont tell a girl who will obviously go and tell your crush and mate   You can make a deal with her that she still spends equal amount of time with you as she does with her boyfriend   Meeting new lads will help you get over your crush but if you seriously think it wont help then dont try to get involved with another boy just yet   Hang out with him and his pals with your crew but dont start flirting with him You dont want to risk losing your friendship with your mate if she catches you Friends are more important than a crush   Start looking at people at school and hang out with them Dont worry everyone finds someone
There are many different levels and types of attraction In some cases your feelings may not be strong enough to warrant moving forward with them in other situations its better to wait a while and see If you feel you really want to admit your feelings however you owe it to yourself to follow through with it  Its probably not the sort of thing you want to be thinking about realistically when you first become attracted to someone but it is nonetheless important to consider just how likely your crush is to return your feelings Has he shown you any signs of attraction beyond friendship or has he turned you away whenever things have gotten personalWeighing the risk of telling your feelings is important if you dont want to risk the friendship   You can do more harm than good by letting a friend know your real feelings especially if the whole thing is approached incorrectly   Finding out about your crushs other potential interests is an important part of weighing your own chances Letting someone know you have feelings for him is a big risk especially if you really value the existing relationship you share together With that in mind its a good idea to make sure someone hasnt beaten you to the chase before going in yourself Even if someone might be interested in you otherwise theres very little chance hell strike up a relationship if hes actively pursuing someone else at the time   Note the difference between real interest and passing attraction If your friend has called a member of the opposite sex goodlooking or even hot that doesnt necessarily mean hes wanting to date them On the contrary he may even be testing you to see if youll react when he says something like that   If your crush likes you chances are youll be able to sense it on some level Does he go out of his way to shower you with attention and compliments If your crush is a girl does she avert her gaze a lot when shes around you or laugh and smile more than usual when youre talking to her   Not only will sensing mutual attraction give you a better idea of what your potential chances are knowing the attraction is there will make you feel more confident when it comes time to admit your feelings   Even if the two of you are both attracted to one another admitting attraction is bringing new business into your relationship and it should be avoided for the time being if you still have current issues to attend to   If you had a recent fight as friends it would be a good idea to hold off on admitting your feelings until the dust has settled and youve resolved your current differences If youre starting a relationship together you want to get it started off on the right foot   Could you imagine someone admitting they have a crush on you if you were in the middle of going through a family tragedy Even if you had feelings in return for that person you wouldnt be able to deal with it at the time Knowing when to strike is a key part of making the approach work Dressing up doesnt have to mean getting glamorous or ritzy What it does mean however is that you should put slightly more effort into your appearance than you usually doThis isnt so much for your crushs benefit as for your own We always feel our most confident when were looking our best If this means taking an extra few minutes to soak up steam in the shower or wearing your favourite shirt then so be it In the end you want to do everything you can to set your mind at rest   Although confidenceboosting is the biggest reason why you should try to look good it goes without saying that your crush is all that more likely to accept you if you put some added effort into your appearance   While it goes to show other people that youre feeling confident using body language like good posture eye contact and smiling will serve to make you feel even more confident Even before you meet up with your crush you should try making a habit of expressing confident body language You should notice a firm change in the way you feel before too long   A relationship is a twoway street and both sides need to be getting something out of it That means you should have a good idea what youll be bringing into a relationship if it works out in your favour Start by making a list of things you love most about yourself Which of these things would benefit a relationship Do you love your smile Your crush probably does too Do you like to laugh Are you really clever or funny Nows not the time to be modest   Reflect upon this list and try to imagine how happy you could make the other person If you know you have a lot to offer youll feel more confident when it comes time to admit your feelingsIf you need any help thinking up things you should try talking to a friend who isnt your crush about what things most stand out about you   The worst injury anyone can cause their chances of starting a relationship with their crush is by doubting themselves When you selfdoubt it shows in the way you act and carry yourself You wont be able to act casual if youre worried about whatif situations as you close inTaking a deep breath is a helpful way to calm your nerves if theyre acting up on you It will take the edge off the stress and give you a respite from the physical anxiety Positive selftalk works as well For example try thinking something along these lines to yourself I have nothing to fear I am worth my crushs time Everythings going to work out just the way I want it Keep telling yourself that until you start believing it Whether you think its plausible or not positive selftalk tends to be a selffulfilling prophecy as the confidence youll gain from it will have a major impact on how the interaction plays out   Its becoming more and more common for people to confess their crushes online or via text message Talking through a screen will work in a pinch but it robs the conversation of its full importance Because so many of the signs of attraction come across through body language youll stifle your chances by keeping it onlineAsk your crush out by saying something like Hey I was thinking of going to the beach sometime this weekend Would you be interested in coming with Keep it casual admitting your feelings doesnt have to be the main point of hanging out with them If you enjoy their company enough it wont feel out of place to get together   A big mistake many people make when it comes to approaching their crushes is that they put too much weight on the act If the experience of being around you is extremely serious and sombre your crush isnt exactly going to be open to starting a relationship with you even if hes already attracted to youA casual hangout could be anything from going to the mall or rock concert to something quieter like the park or beach Activities that limit interaction like a movie arent as well suited for something like this as it wont give you near as much opportunity to confess your feelings Going to dinner is a very common type of casual hangout If you go for food the type of restaurant you go to will help decide the type of atmosphere Something ritzy and formal may be inauthentic if youre not used to going to fancy restaurants Go somewhere the two of you will feel comfortable and relaxed   Eye contact is a way of making the emotions feel real a lot of unconscious communication goes on with eye contact Suffice to say holding your crushs gaze while you admit your feelings will keep him focused on what youre saying   Make a point of holding eye contact when your crush is speaking to you Hold your crushs gaze while you admit your feelings It may be appropriate to look away after you have confessed and are waiting for a response Averting your gaze may help your crush to relax while he prepares a response   Wait until you feel very comfortable with your crush to let him know how you feelThis is the point youve been waiting for at its probably pretty likely youre feeling frazzled at the thought of it But worry not actually telling your crush is in itself a fairly simple action With solid eye contact in place tell your crush how you feel Express it in simple terms so that theres no room for interpretation If you try to dress it up youll only distract from the point youre trying to make Stay confident and treat the experience like a positive thing   You can list some reasons why you like them as well if youd like Use the following as an example You know I dont know if its already totally obvious but I really like you In a way thats more than a friend I hope you feel the same way about me too   One method that tends to work fairly well is actually not to say anything at all Instead expressing your feelings nonverbally can say as much as any number of words While a nonverbal expression will usually be followed by some confirmation that you do have real feelings for this person letting your feelings through in a more subtle way can be a perfect way to break the icePhysical touching is risky if your existing relationship has never included it but its much more likely to succeed if you go into it with confidence in yourself Something as light as reaching for their hand or more bold like a direct kiss will leave little room for interpretation that youre interested Giving a gift also works especially if youre a male in pursuit of a female Giftgiving is often seen as chivalrous and definitely pushes past the boundaries of just friends provided the gift is special enough Buying flowers is a good place to start if you cant think of something more specific but its always best to pick out a gift that really relates to the specific connection and experiences youve shared togetherNonverbal ways of expressing your feelings are always best accompanied with some sort of verbal affirmation Dont just take her hand or give her a gift let her know exactly why youve done that and make it clear the balls now in her court   Now that youve made your feelings known to your crush its time to go into a bit more detail as to where youd like your relationship to go Simply telling someone youre attracted to him isnt an end unto itself if you see it going anywhere you should arrange plans to see one another on a more regular romantic basis provided thats what youre looking for Be specific about what you wantYou might try formally asking your crush on a first date Try saying something like If you agree that theres something special between us maybe youd be interested in going out with me sometime It would be great to get a chance to get to know each other on a deeper level Gauging by the reaction of your crush as you told him your feelings you should have a better idea whether things are going to work out   The anticipation and nervewracking nature of admitting your feelings to someone is rarely about how youre going to do it but the ways in which you think the other person might react If youve admitted your feelings and possibly expressed clear intentions the other person is bound to have some sort of response in store for you Whether its a positive or negative one will depend on the success of your advance and the feelings theyve had or havent had for you all along All the same it is necessary you give your crush some time to properly respond to youStay calm throughout Even in the worst reactions its better to keep a brave face and remain strong rather than let your emotions get the best of you Breaking down into tears was never a good look on anyone   If you get news you dont want to hear its important to remember that its not the end of the world As hard as it is to believe at the time youll feel much better about it as times goes on and possibly even realize that you were better off without taking things to the next level Even so doing some damage control is often the best next step Let your crush know that you care about him as a friend still and you dont want to lose the friendship Take some time to yourself if you feel you need to healRemind your crush that you care about him on multiple levels and arent purely trying to get a relationship out of him For example you can say I know this might change things for us but I want you to know I really value having you as a friend and I dont want to lose you even if you dont feel the same way about me

If her voice drops so that it is deeper and more breathy than usual she may have feelings for you People who study attraction find that girls may think that when they have feelings for someone it is more seductive to make their voice lower and huskier to attract that person Whatever the case paying attention to the tone of her voice could tell you whether or not she is asking you about your feelings because she has a crush on you too If her gaze seems to be going to your face and eyes a lot in conversation she may like youIf she blinks a lot when you are talking to her more than 610 times in a minute then this could be another sign that she does like you If you notice the black pupils in her eyes get smaller when she is looking at you again she might like youBut pay attention to the lighting when her pupils get smaller if the lightness in the room suddenly gets brighter that may be the reason why her pupils are getting smaller   If she raises her eyebrows often when she is talking to you this could mean that she is worried and anxious And the attention that she is paying to you may be because she is worried that you like her   If while she is laughing she straightens up or positions herself so that she looks prettier she may have a crush on you Touching her clothes and tilting her head too can show that she has feelings for you especially if they are all grouped together at the same time For example if she is smiling touching her neck and has her head tilted that might be a very good signBe careful reading too much into these signs some girls who are extroverted might act this way because they enjoy themselves in conversation It might not mean that they have a crush on you Notice how she gestures with her friends to see if she acts the same way in normal conversation If she acts this way with her friends it might only mean that she is an expressive person   There is also body language that could mean that she is not interested in you romantically that you might want to look out for This body language would most likely happen when you are flirting with her If she fake smiles a lot during your interactions for example perhaps she is not interested in you Fake smiling is pretty easy to spot she will smile only with her mouth while her eyes and cheeks look normal Another sign of possible disinterest is if she is raising her eyebrows often in conversation this could be a sign that she is uncomfortable or nervous Yet another sign is if she keeps her arms and legs crossed when you talk to her This may mean that she is not interested or is closed off to you   Ask her if she is worried about anything If she responds that something is causing her anxiety or stress perhaps her gestures arenât about you If she does like you but doesnât know if you like her too then these signs could mean that she is anxious about her feelings for you If you notice that she is sending you mixed signals you may want to ask her how she feels about you   Both guys and girls are not always very good at guessing correctly that someone is flirting with them because flirting is hard to pick up on Attraction can be difficult to pick up on because girls and people in general donât want to be obvious about their romantic feelings if they donât know how they will be taken So make sure you have had lots of conversations before you decide whether she likes you or not Most of all it is important that you pay attention to the way that she acts toward you over time If she asks you if you have a crush on her and you are in a place where it is difficult to talk relocate to a better place Tell her âI want to talk to you about this Can we find a better place to talkâ Go to a place where you two can sit down and talk This could be a park bench a coffee table or a corner in a house that is quiet   Ask her how she feels about going to a particular place if you are worried that she may not be comfortable leaving where you are at the moment   Once you are situated you should bring back up the topic of conversation Say âSo you asked me about how I feel about youâ this will bring a good level of anticipation to your answer You can add a pause if you want to Then say âI have a crush on youâ Donât be overly confident when you tell her how you feel this could make you seem arrogant or hurt you if she doesnât like you back Go for a slightly hopeful and matter of fact tone   It is good to own your feelings whether or not you think that she likes you back Even if you experience rejection you will be able to move on faster because you were honest You might be tempted to ask her why she is asking before you answer but she will appreciate it if you are bold enough and answer her question without asking for an explanation Also this confidence will most likely make you more attractive   You have a right to know if she likes you back You can ask the question straight out âDo you have romantic feelings for meâ It is good to be specific with this question even if it seems unnecessary to be specific or sounds weird The reason why it can be better to say âromantic feelingsâ is because people can take âlikeâ in lots of different ways For example it may be harder for her to answer you honestly if you use âlike meâ instead of âlike me romanticallyâ   Remember that it is better for you in the long run to hear her honest answer about her feelings rather than an ambiguous response The sooner you know her honest feelings about you the sooner you can move on if she doesnât like you Donât assume her reasons for asking you so be kind and honest with her even if you think that she doesnât like you Depending on her personality and her feelings there are a variety of ways she could respond Here are a few possibilities she could answer with a straight yes or no or she might not want to hurt your feelings so she may say things like âI really like you as a friendâ Finally she might answer ambiguously because she doesnât want to hurt you andor doesnât know how she feels about you She might say âI kind of like you but I donât knowâ   This explanation will vary a lot based on how she feels No matter how she feels it is nice to say something in response to her answer Even if she doesnât like you you should be kind to her and respect her feelings   If she likes you back or seems to like you back you can tell her all the awesome reasons why you like her You can talk about how pretty you think she is how intelligent you find her how funny you think she is how caring and kind you think that she is etc Be sure to use specific and concrete examples to compliment her For example you can talk about when you first knew you liked her and how you knew Describe how you knew with a short story âI knew I had a crush on you when we were sitting next to each other in Algebra At first you were so annoying because you knew all the answers to the questions but after a while I found that I couldnât stop smiling when I saw your hand raisedâ If she seems confused or ambiguous you can ask her if she wants you to explain your romantic feelings for her If she wants to know then you can explain all the awesome ways you feel about her Be careful while you explain if she doesnât know how she feels about you because telling her how you feel might make you feel more vulnerable If she doesnât want you to go on respond with the next response If she doesnât like you back keep your cool and try to genuinely thank her for being honest with you Tell her something nice and short For example âI think you are a really cool person Thanks for being honest with meâ She will respect you for being a big person and taking the rejection well If you are having a hard time with your emotions you can say âI think I need some space and time Thanks for talking to meâ Then you can find somewhere to go to be alone for a while   You may feel intense feelings if you are rejected but try to let your first panicked emotions wash over you Your feelings will get less intense after a couple of days Try to wait for them patiently to pass and avoid talking about it to people who you might regret talking to later or doing anything that you will regret For example do not post on social media about her   Exercise can help you process your emotions Going on a run or doing your exercise routine if you notice that your emotions are getting out of control is a healthy way to handle your emotions  We all talk to ourselves in our heads and sometimes we can be very hard on ourselves after we have been rejected For example you might say to yourself âNo one will ever like meâ But when you start to think these negative thoughts ask yourself if your friend would talk to you like that A friend would never say âNo one will ever like youâ and not only because it is not very nice but because it is an unfair and overly negative conclusion that a friend would not think Focus on redirecting your negative thoughts to all of the good things that you did the ways you can still grow or the humor in the situation   Reframe your negative thoughts into positive ones Instead of âNo one will ever like youâ think âShe doesnât like me but that doesnât mean I donât have great qualitiesâ Or focus on the good things you did Say to yourself something like âIt was an awkward situation but you were honest and niceâ   Ask yourself what other things are going on in her life This might be something difficult to do at first but the more you can understand what is going on with her the less the rejection will probably seem about you Remember her feelings are part of a bigger picture that doesnât involve you   Be careful about making assumptions about the way she feels about you For example you might think âShe doesnât like me because I have a funny voiceâ But you canât read her thoughts She may have recently gotten out of a relationship or is interested in someone else whatever the case she is probably preoccupied thinking about her own life and feelings Spend time with good friends who make you feel good about yourself These people will remind you of your interests and the things that you love Pick activities where you will laugh and have fun For example go out to a funny movie with your friends and then talk about it after Laughter will release your endorphins and help you relax If you are having a hard time with your emotions tell her that youâd like some time and space from your friendship Having her out of your life for the time being will help you focus on you Start hanging out with a different friend group or talking to new people this will help you distance yourself from her When you feel like you are ready to move on start talking to girls you are interested in
Remember if you never tell this person you like them youre risking never knowing if they like you and could miss out on a wonderful relationship You might regret this in the future  Make sure you sincerely like them to avoid an awkward relationship   Get to know them better   If youre already friends with the someone and you would much rather stay friends forever dont break your friendship because youre afraid of making it awkward between the two of you See where it goes first then decide   Because I like you If you dont do this you risk being forever in the friendzone or not being in a zone at all Do NOT attempt this over an online chat or over the phone This makes the situation even more awkward than it needs to be Telling your crush that you like them in person benefits the both of you as you get to see their genuine reaction   And for all we know theres never a good time to tell someone you like them It will probably be awkward even if they like you back But it sure is awesome if they do   That would make the situation very awkward for your crush and heshe would probably try to avoid you   Say something like I had a great day good night This lets them know that you enjoyed your day with them By dropping this type of hint it also makes it a bit easier to tell them that you like them
Do you feel like you two have nothing in common anymore Does she do things that make you angry Are you going off to college and want to stop before the relationship becomes a longdistance one This should not be a decision you make quickly or in anger Think carefully about your reasons for wanting to break up with your girlfriend Explore your feelings and ask yourself if you have good reasons or if they are issues that you could resolve by talking to herIf youâre angry after a fight take time to think about whether you want to break up or if youâre just angry in the moment If you are jealous of her relationship with her friends talk to her about that rather than just breaking up over it If she is abusive end the relationship Verbal and physical abuse is a dealbreaker  When you break up with a person they want to know why Be ready with answers for her Be honest but kind  Iâm sorry Iâm heading off for the army and I need to focus on that and not on our relationship I am going to be so busy there wonât be any time for a relationshipâ Iâve had a great time with you but I think weâve both changed and arenât the same people we were when we got together We donât seem to have anything in common anymoreâ Iâve really tried to give this a go but I donât want to go out with you anymore I feel like youâre not interested in me That makes me sad Iâve tried to talk to you about it but it seems like you donât want to resolve itâ   Think about her responses  sad angry silent  and how you are going to deal with them Do you want to comfort her or just deliver the message and leave Keep in mind that these interactions often donât go as planned so be ready to improvise They are always challenging and difficult but try to be kind and sympathetic to her feelings  Iâm sorry youâre so sad I just donât think this is right for either of us I know youâll find someone much better than I am for youâ Look I understand that youâre angry but I donât want to fight I am going to walk away and we can talk about this laterâ I know Iâve made you really upset Iâm sorry If you want to talk about it sometime later please let me knowâ   Dont break up with her in the hallway with everybody around Choose a time that isnât during the school day Think about doing it outside maybe taking a walk That way you donât have to look at each other  sometimes that helps with a really emotional conversation Dont do it through Facebook texts over the phone etc No one deserves that kind of treatment Even if youâre worried about how itâs going to go you need to be brave and do it facetoface Doing it through texts or Facebook may feel a lot better to you but it certainly wonât to her If you want to have any kind of friendship with her in the future do the right thing and do it in person For this difficult conversation you might want to start by letting her know that you have something important you need to say She will probably have some idea that itâs about breaking up  Start by saying something nice about her âI need to talk to you but I wanted to let you know Iâve always thought youâre such a kind personâ Or âWhatever happens between the two of us I wanted to tell you that you are a great singer and I hope you continue with musicâ Tell her why the relationship is not working for you âI donât think we share interests any moreâ or âIâm having a lot of trouble with my parentsâ divorce right now and I need to focus on dealing with my anger not being in a relationshipâ Explain that you want to break up You need to say this explicitly so she knows that this isnât a conversation about trying to make your relationship better âI am breaking up with you  Iâm sorryâ You could also tell her  âI need to break this relationship off Iâm not ready to be so serious with youâ Be comforting and say something nice about her âYou are such a beautiful person you are going to find someone who can give you the kind of relationship you wantâ You could also say âYou deserve someone smart and ready to be in the kind of committed relationship you deserveâ   It might be that she is feeling the same way you are Chances are however that she has different ideas about the relationship She might want to try and continue it and then it will be up to you to decide if you want to try and work on it or go through with the breakup as planned   Even if it goes as you planned youâre probably going to feel emotionally fragile when itâs over Breaking up is difficult in any situation because youâre typically going to be making the other person feel bad Take some time to yourself to think things over after you have talked to your exgirlfriend   Even though it might seem like a good idea to get back out there and find someone new itâs usually a poor idea Youâre not at your emotional best and you should take a few weeks to think through what you want to do going forward   Sometimes hanging out with your friends is the best way to move forward They were with you through the relationship and will be there to support you now Plan fun activities to keep you occupied and less likely to dwell on your romantic situation If you want to discuss the break up with your friends thatâs fine but donât keep bringing it up  you need to move on and your friends probably arenât excited to hear about it over and over   Even if she wants to be in touch you need a period where you two are not communicating so that the relationship can end and you can both adjust to the new reality You might be able to communicate as friends in a few months but donât seek her out If she contacts you explain that you need time and donât want to be in contact just yet   When you see her around be friendly Even if she ignores you or yells itâs better for you to be mature and treat her respectfully

As you begin to conclude your letter reaffirm your feelings briefly Say something like I will continue to look forward to my morning algebra class as it give me a chance to be close to you You want the recipient to know youre feelings are serious and not fleeting You can also briefly summarize what was said in the letter to help you reach your concluding thoughts It can be difficult to do but you should try to end on a single sentence that sums up the gist of what youre saying This is an elegant way to end a love letter It can reiterate your feelings and leave a lasting impression on the recipientIt may take a few tries before you find the right sentence You may want to grab a piece of scrap paper and write down a few sentences before settling on one to include in your letter Its okay to be a little cheesy Love letters are often somewhat overwrought but infatuation itself is often dramatic Dont be afraid to use language that sounds somewhat hyperbolic or ridiculousIn our example try something like You really do light up my mornings Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays with your spark passion and enthusiastic nature   If you want this letter to lead to a possible date provide some contact information for yourself You can say something like If youre interested text or call the following number You could also include your email or a link to a social media profile   Once youve finished your letter find a way to deliver it This can be tricky if youre writing to someone you dont know  If you know the persons name it might be a good idea to write her name on a envelop and place the letter in there Then leave the envelop where she will see it For example if youre writing to someone who works at a coffee shop you could leave the letter on your table or where drinks are set down  If you have an email address for the person consider emailing your letter If the two of you have a mutual friend see if that friend can deliver the letter Do not try to send the letter in the mail Getting a letter in the mail from a stranger can be scary You do not want to come off as creepy
