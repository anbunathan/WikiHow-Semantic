Almost all friends hang out and often itll just be oneonone If your friend has been suggesting lots of oneonone hangouts thats extremely common for both close friends and for flirty romances and not necessarily a sign of a romance But if youve noticed that its happening a lot lately or more than usual it might be a sign your friend likes you   If your friend doesnt want to hang out with other people when youre hanging out together that could definitely be a sign  You might see your friends often but if you feel the need to check in with this person all the time every single day there might be a lot more there than a regular old friendship Does your day feel incomplete if you dont talk to your friend Do you miss your friend even if youre just apart for the afterschool period of the day   Keep in mind texting as well If youre regularly having neverending text conversations were talking hundreds of messages a day then you might like each other Going for coffee just the two of you Going to dinner or for long walks in the evenings Are they going out of their way to invite you to something you love but they dont care much about Thats a sure sign that your friend is showing you that you matter to them a lot Maybe they like you more than a friend   If your friend likes you they may start touching you more While some people are naturally handson an increase in physical contact is almost always a sign of romantic interest You may find that theyre doing it to test your boundaries like dipping your toe in the water to find out how cold it is If you notice that its happening quite frequently its a big sign   If the contact makes you uncomfortable then say something about it Its never ok to touch someone inappropriately and out of the blue if youre not interested   If they are giving you very personal gifts such as poems songs or things that you specifically like your friend may be trying to get a message across in big bold letters I Like You   Personal gifts and handmade items are usually signs of romantic interest Mix CDs Huge sign of a crush   Some people are just naturally flirty The barista the server the bus driver might all be flirted with in the course of a day for the naturally flirtatious Of course you may find that your platonic relationship has suddenly turned flirty on a regular basis where it wasnt before They may not be so subtle or shy about their crush on you   If your friend is paying you a lot of compliments or making cheeky little flirty comments its a safe bet that they like you and are interested   If your friend tells you everythingâlike everythingâthen its a pretty good sign that youve got a morethanfriends relationship You might talk to friends about school and your sports team and other normal stuff But if youre regularly talking to someone about your dreams your hopes your fears and your deepest kind of stuff That might be a sign that theres more going on thereHaving deep conversations is also something that happens between very close friends If youre just having good conversations but dont notice any other signs its not necessarily a sign of anything more   If youre just friends with someone theres not usually any reason to feel nervous about anything If your friend seems to be suddenly anxious to be around you that could be a sign that youre becoming more than a friend to them Try to pay attention to their body language and their level of nervousness   Does your friend seem to be making an extra effort at looking good in your presence If you made plans to walk around the mall but your friend looks like theyre done up for a date it might be because they think theyre going on one   Pay especially close attention to things like hair product makeup and fancy clothes If your friend is putting in the extra effort youll notice   Try bringing up a current crush that youve got Even if you have to make it up bring up the concept of dating someone else and see how your friend reacts If they like you they may get jealous or become kind of down They may make fun of the person you say youve got a crush on This is all a sign that theyre interested   Ask your friend about their current crushes If they get embarrassed or dont want to talk about it it might be because their crush is sitting in your chair   If youre wondering whether or not your friend likes you more than a friend it might be because youre feeling those feelings yourself But it can be hard to tell the difference sometimes Whats the difference between wanting to hang out with someone a lot and wanting to be more Maybe nothing All relationships move at different paces and it can be hard to tell   Do you think about your friend more your other crushes or love interests If so you might be having deeper feedings Are you attracted to your friend physically If so you might like them but you also might like them even if you never really noticed them before You might like what youve gotten to know on the inside   If youve noticed some signs that your friend might have a crush on you its important to give some thought to the way that you feel before you do anything about it Decide what youll do for either outcome before you actually do anything   Assume the answer is yes and that your friend likes you Do you feel the same way Would you like your friendship to be more than just a friendship Assume the answer is no and that your friend doesnt like you Might bringing it up make your friend uncomfortable If you do like your friend and would like to be more do you think talking about it might harm the friendship you do have   The best and fastest way to find out if your friend likes you is to just ask If youve noticed more than a couple of the signs listed in the previous section theres a good chance that your friend might like you Sit them down say Weve been spending a lot of time together I just noticed and I started wondering âÂ Do you like me Do you want to be more than friendsEven if they dont like you if your friend is a true and caring friend they wont be offended if you ask or if you talk about whether or not you want to be more than just friends If you think your friendship might suffer and youre not interested in being a couple then you might consider not asking Dont worry about whether or not they like you and just continue being friends   If youve noticed some signs of attraction but youre just not sure then ask around Talk to a trusted mutual friend who knows both of you equally Say something gentle and kind like Ive noticed that ___ seems to be paying a lot of attention to me lately Do you think theres something there   Asking around doesnt mean spreading rumors Dont tell people that your friend likes you if you havent talked to them first   If you suspect they do like you and you like them back then tell them Take a chance You never know where it could take you And if you dont like them and they are making you uncomfortable its also important to tell them You dont deserve to feel uncomfortable and your friend probably doesnt want you to feel uncomfortable either   Even if you dont like them back it can be good to clear the air and be honest with one another If youre made uncomfortable by your friends advances it might be important to spend some time apart for a while   If your friend does like you and you dont or vice versa it might make it hard to keep hanging out like you have been Its sad to think that your friendship might suffer but in some cases its important to spend a little time apart so you can stay friends in the longterm   In some cases if your feelings are strong enough it might be hard to stay friends like you used to be if you feel differently about each other You may find yourselves naturally moving apart from each other Thats ok Its a big part of growing up
Do you only like him because he is taken or do you genuinely like him Do you think it would change anything if you told him how you feel about him  How well do you get along Try to find reasons as to why you like him so much You need to understand your feelings to allow you to make the correct decision and to be able to express them in a confident way   Follow the next section before deciding that its okay to tell him your true feelings By spending more time with him youll get to know him better hell grow to trust you more and maybe just maybe he might see things differently too   Show interest in his social life and hang around with friends he hangs around with This shows a guy that you are confident enough to spend break times with his own friends at times in an outgoing manner   It is uncomfortable to speak to a guy you really like in front of his girlfriend who might easily realize your interest in her guy and become jealous Start a conversation on Facebook to get around this For instance while he is online ask him simple questions like how hes doing and how did he do in an exam   Go for questions like whats your favourite food or what movies do you like most This helps you learn more about him and in doing so you keep your conversation going while also showing him you care   If your conversations are a bit stuck in the same discourse then try to find ways to make them interesting Dont always start the conversation with hey or hi there Instead find out what his favorite subject is and try to find a picture a joke or a quote which is related to that Then you can pass it on with an excuse that you might like this or that this reminded me of you This shows a guy that you remember what he tells you   If it seems appropriate try to offer advice in case of some ups and downs that they may be having Even if you actually think of hitting her in the face often for having the guy you are crazy about showing interest in their relationship gets him to trust you with his personal issues while it also acts as a key to discovering what he likes and what he doesnt like in his relationship   After doing all of this some time should have passed by and by then you can figure out if what you feel towards him is a strong feeling or just something temporary If you notice that these are recurring feelings which are only becoming stronger by time its time to face the music and let him know how you feel The main question is howÂ    If youve decided that its worth telling him then its time to give it a try You must be confident with yourself and with what you feel in order to express yourself correctly and clearly Do not hesitate or fear that you will end up being rejected On the bright side if that happens you would have figured out what he truly feels towards you and can hence move on without thinking what could have been   The best way to tell him is face to face however with his girlfriend around that might not always be ideal So a text message or a message via Facebook can help you get what you want to tell him across   When you are dealing with feelings honesty really is the best policy Dont lie to him about it just come right out and tell him   Be considerate Your crush has a girlfriend Remember that she has feelings too If youre friends with her tell her too You dont want to ruin your friendship with her   Then include something like I was wondering the other day and I have something to tell you When he responds yeah go on Im listening tell him the truth Dont talk in a very hyperbolic way because it might scare him Let him know that you are aware about his girlfriend but still you wanted to let him know even if nothing will change after this moment at least you confronted him with confidence   Say something like Weve been speaking for the past few weeksmonths now and I have gotten to know more about you Honestly the thing is I like you I really do And I know that you have a girlfriend but still I wanted you to know   This will determine the type of response that you give to him   If its just an okay or thanks say Im relieved now that I told you  If he answers back in a long paragraph with the fact that he has a girlfriend and other excuses just say Its okay I wanted to be honest and I understand that you have a girlfriend Im okay with that If you get the answer youve been hoping for I like you too just go ahead and carry on your conversation to see how things can unfold between you   If he already has a girlfriend then youre likely to be rejected Dont take it personally and remember that if he said he would break up with his girlfriend for you then consider whether hes the type of guy you would want to be with If that happens then get over him   Letting him know how you feel sets peace to your mind because no matter what the answer might be youll know you would have let him know whatever you wanted him to know However never force him into liking you or into leaving his girlfriend for you After all you definitely rather be his first choice rather than his secondÂ
Spend a few days catching her gaze every now and then Dont just stare at her though instead shoot her small glances until your eyes meet and she catches you When she does smile slightly and look away after a second Youll probably blush as well which is all the better  blushing indicates youre nervous which is a hint that you like her  When you do talk to her pick a time thats convenient Dont try to get her attention when shes obviously involved in something else and try to have a bit of privacy  you dont have to be completely alone but her attention shouldnt be too distracted   Make the interaction extra casual and put a time limit on it by talking to her while youre both walking somewhere else If you walk to a class at the same time as her or you start walking the same way home this is a great opening   Paying a girl the right compliment makes your intentions clear right away  shell know instantly that youre interested in being more than her friend Here are some things to consider   Know how to deliver a compliment Even the best compliment in the world will fall flat if your delivery is off Keep a half smile as you talk  it will make you naturally add appealing inflection to your voice Try this trick out when you answer the phone sometime and see if you notice a difference Maintain eye contact with her and keep the tones of your voice up but lower the actual volume  speaking softly immediately communicates intimacy and it can make her instinctively lean in closer to hear you If this all sounds a bit difficult practice it in front of a mirror first As anyone whos ever had a stalker can tell you theres a fine but definite line between flattering and creepy With this in mind choose your compliment wisely Saying something like You always look amazing in that shirt can come off as weird if you dont know her well and implies that you watch her Even if you do its best not to spill that information immediately Instead opt for something general but cute such as Your smile is glowing today Whats making you so happy or I thought what you said in class earlier was really interesting A good compliment should naturally lead to more conversation instead of just hanging awkwardly in the air after you say it Know what to avoid If youre going to pay a girl a compliment about her physical looks stick to her eyes smile or hair Do not comment on her body otherwise especially on the first interaction If you want to play it extra safe pick something you already know shes proud of For instance if you know shes a dedicated violinist say something like Ive heard youre an amazing musician and use it as a way to ask her some questions about it   You might be tempted to stop talking and just stare at this girl but dont let your nerves get the best of you Allowing a long lull in the conversation will make things feel awkward     Ask about what she thinks of a shared homework assignment or an upcoming event Asking for her opinion communicates that you care about what she thinks and see her as more than just an object Use the conversation to find out more about her but be subtle For instance if you want to find out if she already has a boyfriend you could casually ask So anything fun planned with your boyfriend for the weekend If she doesnt have one and shes interested in you shell let you know immediately Ask openended questions For instance instead of saying So have anything fun planned for the break which can be answered with a short yes or no say What are you going to do to keep busy while school is out A question that requires a detailed response is always better to keep a conversation flowing   If youre sure youve got a joke shell appreciate give it a shot The goal is to show her you have an engaging sense of humor but you dont want to come off as desperate or cheesy   If possible crack a joke about the current situation or something you both saw happen Situational humor is more meaningful than a joke you read online Dont tell a dirty joke Its not appropriate for a first conversation and it might give her the wrong impression If she doesnt get the joke dont explain it to her unless she asks Just move on quickly with a new point of conversation Good humor is really attractive but bad humor is a complete turn off If you cant think of a joke that makes sense with the situation at hand leave it alone   Follow that old saying  Always leave them wanting more Find a way to gracefully duck out of the conversation before it goes stale Good luck
Donât try to change your crushâs mind or prove to them how great you are This might get on their nerves and worse it will make you feel a little pathetic Save your energy for someone who likes you and leave your crush aloneRemember that there are many reasons your crush might not be interested in you Maybe theyâve liked someone else for a long time or maybe they like you as a friend but donât think youâd be a compatible couple It doesnât mean thereâs anything wrong with you   If you are friends with your crush itâs normal to feel a little awkward around them after getting rejected Let them know that you need some time away from them to get over your feelings If they are a good friend theyâll understand and respect your wishes   If you arenât really friends with your crush you donât need to explain to them that youâre taking some time away from them In fact itâs probably better if you donât   Resist the urge to stalk your crush online by unfriending or unfollowing them on the social media platforms you use If youâre worried about caving in and refollowing them later block themYou can always readd them in the future once youâre over your feelings   Donât try to get a glimpse of your crush in the hallway at school or in the break room at work no matter how tempting the idea may be Put as much distance as you can between yourself and them If you have to see your crush every day try to sit far away from them and avoid conversationBe polite Itâs okay to say hello if you happen to see your crush but donât linger or try to start a conversation   If you and your crush have mutual friends let them know that youâre trying to get over some feelings and ask them not to talk about your crush around you for a while Donât ask what your crush is up to or whether theyâre dating anybody since this might reignite your old emotions   Music movies and books can all be helpful in getting over an unrequited flame but stay away from entertainment that helps you wallow in your feelings If certain media makes you think about your crush cut it out for a while and replace it with something that isnât so emotionally loaded   Try indulging in escapism for a while Look for novels and TV shows that transport you to worlds very different from your everyday life
This is the simplest most direct way to make a girl blush Almost everyone appreciates a good compliment If you choose the right words â walking the thin line between sincere and funny â she just might blush A few tips are below   Try to make the compliment about her rather than about her things As a simple example you might say You look great in that dress instead of I like your dress Explore topics besides her looks For example her smarts and artistic abilities are also great things to bring up Dont lay it on too thick One or two compliments per conversation are fine A constant string of compliments will usually make people feel uncomfortable  Sometimes a single look can say a thousand words When you catch her eye as you talk smile at her and keep your gaze for a few seconds longer than you normally would If she is shy even the slightest amount of eye contact may turn her cheeks pink If she smiles back at you this can be a sign she feels an attraction for you though you shouldnt go off of this alone   When something else catches your attention or someone else starts talking break your eye contact Dont keep staring at the girl â this can come across as creepy leering   Not all girls will blush over something as innocent as eye contact However a little goodnatured flirting can usually do the trick Flirting is a skill that is a little too complex to explain in a single step so see our article on it for detailed instructions   One basic way to flirt is to give someone a ridiculous compliment with a joking or sarcastic delivery For example if the girl flexes to show off her bicep you might say something like Oooh soo sexy It should come across like youre teasing her but being a little sincere at the same time   This takes a little finesse but it works great when you get good at it Your goal here is to embarrass the girl but only slightly and only about something thats not actually very important You should always keep your teasing lighthearted Back off immediately if you sense that she feels offended or deeply embarrassed   A good rule is to tease her about her skills or decisions instead of her personality or appearance For example teasing her about her bad driving skills can be cute On the other hand teasing her about a few light wisps of facial hair is a bad idea   When youre hanging out in a group of people try making a joke that only she will get It can be a reference to something from your past something funny that happened to you two but not the other people or something that references a mutual interest If you pull it off shell feel special Out of all the people you singled out her for some humor   Thinking up an inside joke is up to you â only you can search your shared history for something amusing to say   Girls like boys listen to their peers If she hears her friends or family talking about what an amazing desirable person you are she may start thinking about you in new romantic ways Your best bet for this to happen is to simply present your best self Look as good as you can have confidence in yourself and make an effort to be friendly to all of her peers   If youre already dating impressing her parents with your politeness and achievements can be a major plus For many girls the approval of the parents can mean the world A little oldfashioned chivalry and good manners in front of the parents can make you look like an absolute gentleman If you really want to look good consider getting a cleancut haircut as well   If youre dating the girl that youre trying to make blush you have more options at your disposal because you already share a level of intimacy Let her know that shes extremely valuable to you If youre comfortable with the idea and your relationship has reached this point you can also bring the L word into the conversation For the best effect your actions should reflect your words A few ideas for showing your seriousness are below   Write her a sweet handpenned note Make her a mix with her favorite songs on it Take her to your favorite hiking or camping spot Share a picnic somewhere with a gorgeous view Treat her to a semifancy night out just because   On the other hand if the girl youre trying to make blush isnt your girlfriend making your romantic intentions known can certainly make her blush This can be something as simple as breaking the touch barrier for instance touching her shoulder as you laugh or a little flirting If you want to be drastic consider asking the girl out Shes certain to be flattered even if she doesnt feel the same way If she does you have an exciting new relationship to explore   If youre ready to take the plunge see our guide on asking girls out   When it comes to complimenting a girl youll want to avoid anything that makes her feel like a sex object or a piece of meat rather than a feeling thinking human being Keep you compliments about her beauty her intelligence her decisions and her personality Avoid the following subjects   Her sex characteristics eg bust size How revealing or nonrevealing her clothing is Her race or ethnicity Outward identifiers of her religion or social status   While its OK to be attracted to someone or be captivated by someones beauty getting too fixated on her looks can be a great way to ruin your chances In extreme cases this sort of behavior can constitute harassment Actions and comments that are inappropriately personal or sexual or personal are offlimits Avoid the following sorts of actions   Staring or ogling â especially if youre looking below the neck Asking prying questions about her dating or sex history Pressing her for a chance to hang out together if she says no or offers an excuse for why she cant Making any sort of comment that insinuates that she should do something sexual with you   Touching a someone inappropriately against their will is wrong At best it is cause for this person to get angry with you At worst it can be a crime If you havent already established that touching is OK keep your hands to yourself except for harmless flirtatious gestures like briefly touching her shoulder as you laugh If she appears uncomfortable or asks you to stop stop â even if you dont think youre doing anything wrong   As noted above gentle teasing can be a great way to flirt with a girl and get her to blush However theres a fine line to be aware of here Teasing a girl in a way that makes her feel selfconscious or under attack can lead to hurt feelings anger and even lasting grudges Avoid the following sorts of topics as a general rule   Negative comments about her appearance or weight Serious criticisms of her personal political or religious views Gossipy comments about her family or the people she spends time with Meanspirited imitations of her tics or habits   A few sincere presents or a fancy night out every once in a while can be great for showing that a girl means a lot to you However trying to throw your weight around by spending lots of money on your outings or buying luxurious gifts isnt a good idea It may make her blush but if shes intelligent her blushing is likely to be out of embarrassment for you Money is entirely separate from your ability to make girls feel special People with lots of money can be romantic but this isnt why theyre romantic Trying to woo girls with money is only likely to make you end up broke or in the company of women with poor life priorities
When you like someone itâs important to show interest in the things that are important to that person When your crush tells you a story or gives their opinion use your facial expressions to demonstrate that youâre paying attention Listening will also allow you to bring up the topic in later conversations Be sure to stay focused on your crushâs eyes and face whenever the two of you chat This will let them know youâre engaged in your interactions with them This could also act as a subtle way to show them that you like themAvoid making your eye contact creepy Allow yourself to blink and donât be so worried about maintaining eye contact that you never look away from your crushâs face   When you pass them in the hallway or have a casual conversation by your lockers smile This will light up your face and show that youâre a positive and confident person This could also make them enjoy your interactions more and cause them to look forward to seeing you each day

The best time to do this is when youre in the middle of a really great conversation Drop the request in really casually and make it seem really low pressure   Say something simple like Hey why dont we trade cell numbers By the way I just got an iPhone What kind of phone do you have The moment after a phone number exchange can be a little awkward Make sure that you dont miss a beat Keep the conversation flowing so that the number exchange seems completely natural    Before you send your first message have a plan of what you are going to say or what you want to achieve by the end of the conversation   A simple What are you doing or What are you up to is a good conversation starter   If your crush replies that he or she is watching television listening to music or playing a game reply by asking about what theyre watching listening to or playing Whatever your crush says you want to be ready with a followup question to keep the conversation flowing Your crush may say something along the lines of Im doing my homework In reply you can say something like We got loads didnt we Mine took ages to finish Or if your crush doesnt go to your school you could say Oh poor you Ha did you get a lot Tell your crush what youre up to as well When your crush texts you letting you know what he or she is doing send a reply like Thats cool Im just checking Facebook or whatever else youre actually doing at the time   Look for clues in the conversation to see whether the person is enjoying texting back and forth whether the person has had enough of the conversation or whether youre ready to step it up and ask your crush on a date   If the answers to your texts are really short or clipped then you should probably text back something like Okay catch you later or See you later alligator Cute texting moveDont read too much into it The person could be really busy or in a bad mood Just make sure that you dont make yourself look desperate or needy by trying to push a conversation when it isnt happening When your crush responds by asking you questions like What are you doing then you know that he or she wants to keep talking Just let the conversation flow naturally However make sure they are the one to end the conversation Be talkative and forward Look for chances to take it to the next level If the conversation starts to get intense or veers to really personal subjects or if your crush starts to confide in you about a problem then you can say Why dont you call me so that we can talk I want to get together sometime maybe Be bold If you know the time is right ask your crush on a date If they reject there are plenty of fish in the sea   If the reply is something like Okay I guess or Pretty normal you could ask what he or she thought of the homework the science experiment you did the geography project youve been assigned the book report due in next week or the exams that are coming up soon     If youre texting your crush just before Christmas or right before his or her birthday then ask your crush about the plans he or she has for celebrating If youre texting the person just after a holiday send a text that says Hey did you have a good birthday Get anything special Learn about holidays that you dont celebrate For example if your crush celebrates Hanukkah while you celebrate Christmas ask questions to learn what his or her holiday is about Text your crush around New Years Day and ask if the person made any New Years resolutions Share your resolutions back   Your crush could be complaining about a sibling or maybe your crush has an older sibling who is headed off to college If you have siblings yourself say something like I can relate to the problems youre having with your sister My sister drives me crazy You can also ask questions about parents or even about pets     If your crush is on the tennis team ask how his or her latest match went If your crush has other interests like band school newspaper or academic extracurriculars then ask what he or she has been up to lately in some of these activities Has your crush recently been in a competition of some sort Was the person on a winning quiz bowl team or did he or she get a part in the school play Text the person to say Congratulations   Maybe your crush had a bad exam grade lost an important game or experienced something really sad like the death of a pet or family member Send the person a text saying something like Im so sorry to hear what happened How are you holding up   With a text you have 160 characters to send a great message You dont have to reply to your crushs text instantaneously Deliver a response after youve had some time to think about it   Make sure that you have an unlimited texting plan or that you are tracking the number of texts that you send carefully You dont want you or your parents to get a nasty surprise when the cell phone bill arrives Abbreviations can make you look shallow and flighty Save the abbreviations for your BFFs and use complete sentences and capitalization when you text your crush   Smilies or sad faces are okay but you need to be pretty certain that your crush likes you back before using a flirty emoticon Definitely be at least 99 sure that heshe likes you before using a love emoticon   Dont text himher too often Texting once or twice a week is good enough You dont want to look desperate

You canât move on until youâve accepted that you and your former partner are no longer together and that the relationship isnât coming back  Donât call text email or otherwise contact or talk to your ex It will only make it harder for you to get yourself together and move on   There may be a time when you and your former partner can be friends but that time is definitely not nowAbsolutely under no circumstances visit their Facebook page Unfriend them and stay awayAlso stay away from his or her close friends It may be difficult if you have mutual friends but for the time being stick close to your own friends Youâll avoid getting pulled back into any drama and hearing about what your ex is up to   Go through and get rid of any mementos photos or other reminders of your former relationship   You canât move on if youâre still clinging to remnants of the relationship and you definitely wonât move on if you still attach sentiment to them   Hanging out in places the two of you used to go will make it harder for you to move on   You may be able to begin going back to them eventually but for now stay away   Recognize the feelings that you still have about the person andor relationship whether itâs anger sadness disappointment longing or resentmentDonât try to hide from the feelings Instead allow yourself to feel them fully so if you need to wallow then wallow Accept your feelings so that then you can begin to move on   Think critically about why the relationship ended including mistakes you made as well as mistakes your expartner may have made   Use what youve learned from the mistakes each of you made to begin building strategies to avoid similar missteps in the future   Using healthy outlets will not only help you deal with your feelings but also improve your own wellbeing at the same time   Beating yourself up or becoming selfdestructive will make the situation infinitely worse and make the process of moving on much longer and harderLet your friends and family be your resourcetalk to them and let them be there for you Going running hitting the gym hello punching bag taking a hike joining a yoga classall excellent options Writebut donât sendan angry letter Let all your ugliest feelings out and let yourself have some catharsis But do not send the letter It will make your situation worse rather than better and stop you from moving on Look for a strong role model you can look up to as well as take inspiration from Perhaps a friend or character or public figure who got back up better than ever after getting knocked downThe more you can take inspiration from people who have stumbled and caught themselves the easier it will be to envision yourself doing the same   Itâs harder to pine for an ex when youâre seeking new partners But make sure to keep your feelings about your ex and the relationship out of your new dating scene   Avoid bringing up or grumbling about your ex with a datedonât let the old relationship taint your new ones
When youâre looking at new saddles one of the things youâll need to pay attention to is the bars The bars are the weightdistributing foundation for the saddle the part of the saddle that rests on the horse and holds you up There are two âbarsâ that distribute weight evenly on either side of the spine If your saddle is wellfitting the horseâs back will be in contact with the entire length of the bars  On a saddle the cantle is the rear section that acts as the back of a seat it slopes upwards a bit like a chair The bars are connected to the cantle at the bottom holding the entire saddle together The cantle is a term that references both an English and a western saddle   On a western saddle the fork is the section in the front that holds the bars together It is located underneath the horn and has the appearance of an upside down âUâ shape There are two primary types of forks  a slick fork and a swell fork A slick fork is the most popular and is recognized by sides that angle straight up to the horn A swell fork is recognized by thicker curved edges that rise to the horn On an English saddle the pommel is the front section of the saddle that holds the bars together English saddles donât have horns like western saddles do they just have a rounded section at the front  the pommel Think of it as a smaller rounder version of the cantle   Another very important aspect of fitting your saddle to your horse is making sure the gullet fits properly The gullet refers to the empty space between the bars of the saddle When the saddle is placed on a horseâs back you can examine the fit by looking at the gullet from the front and back   The saddle tree refers to the bars cantle forkpommel and the gullet These are the areas that must be examined when sizing a saddle So when checking your horse for fit look at the parts of the saddle tree   The rocker refers to the angular curve of the bars from the front of the saddle to the back Imagine it as similar to the shapeangle of the base of a rocking chair Depending on the shape of the topline of your horse you will have to try saddles with different rocker angles   A second important angular measurement of the saddle tree is the twist This refers to the angle the bars bend outwards typically they are closer in the middle and further apart at the front and back like â â Some saddles have wider twists than others which may affect the measurement for the horse and rider   The flare of the saddle is the amount the bars of the saddle flare out at the front This is how much the bars curve upwards at the front and back of the saddle by the cantle and pommelfork This term is the easiest to recognize the seat of the saddle is the part that you sit in The seat has two primary things that should be noted  the length and slope The length of the seat is how much space it takes up from the front to the back a well fitting saddle will allow you to sit forward without being pressed against the cantle and will give about four inches between your position and the front of the forkpommel The slope is the angle from the front of the seat to the back and comes in three options high medium and low Each slope is found in seats for different types of riding
Remember when you checked your horseâs withers and topline This is when that comes in handy Place the saddle on your horse without a saddle padblanket If it fits the bars should be in contact with the horse down the entire length of their back   If the bars touch only the base of the horseâs back but not the top then the saddle is too narrow If the bars touch only the top of the horseâs back but not the bottom then the saddle is too wide   The slope of the bar is the angle of the rocker against the angle of the horseâs back A wellfitting saddle will have bars that mimic the angle of the topline Therefore the bars will be in contact along the entire strip of the horseâs back   If the bars touch only the withers and the croup then âbridgingâ will occur and cause sores on the horse This happens if the bars are too long or if their isnât a large enough slope to match the sway of the horseâs back If the bars contact the center of the horseâs back only then rocking will occur This happens if the bars are too short or if the slope of the bars is too great to mimic the horseâs back   The angle at which the bars turn upwardsoutwards at the front at back of the saddle is the bar flare If there is little to no bar flare evident then the saddle may be too small for your horse Make sure that your saddle has evident bar flare to prevent it from digging into your horseâs back while riding causing sores or chafing   Place the saddle on your horse without a blanket or saddle pad Look at gullet from the croup of the horse you should be able to see all the way through to the withers If you cannot then the saddle is too small Then go to the gullet by the withers and place as many fingers as you can vertically in the empty space A wellfitting saddle will allow for 225 fingers to stack in the gullet more than that means your saddle is too large while less means that the saddle is too small
People will often express themselves through their body language These signals can range from being obvious to subtle requiring you to pay careful attention Try to look out for some of the following examples of body language to determine if a girl might be interested in you or notStanding or sitting close to you can be a sign of interest If she makes eye contact often and smiles or laughs a lot she might be interested in you Lightly touching your arms or shoulders can be a show of affection If she crosses her arms looks distracted or avoids contact with you she is probably uninterested Some people may differ in regards to how they use their body language These signs wont always apply  Does she always come find you at lunch Does she stop by your locker after school Does she regularly visit you at work Has she taken an interest in your activities If she makes an effort to be around you she obviously likes spending time with you That may not mean that she is interested in you romantically but if she treats you different than all other guys there is a good chance she is   Many say that this is the best way to find out if someone is interested in you Ask yourself if it seems like she wants to spend time with you If the answer is yes she probably likes you If she is willing to make eye contact with you that is a good sign to begin with Our facial expressions are great indicators of our feelings If the girl gives you a warm welcoming look and a smile when you see her that is definitely a sign of positive feelings However sometimes people might fake smiles Learn some of the following traits of genuine smiles and fake smiles to accurately gauge interestGenuine smiles will involve the eyes A person who is smiling will close their eyes and should have âcrowsfeetâ wrinkles appear Fake smiles will generally not involve the eyes at all There wont be any closing of the eyes or âcrowsfeetâ appearing with a fake smile In a genuine smile you shouldnt be able to see the persons bottom teeth Fake smiles will likely reveal both the top and bottom rows of teeth   If you think she likes you thereâs a pretty good chance she likes youTry not to spend too much time thinking about it Itâs natural to be nervous about something like this but thinking about it constantly isnât helping anything Take stock of the information that you have available to you and decide on a course of action It would be better to decide to ask her out or decide to do nothing then to keep torturing yourself   None of these clues guarantee that she is into you but if youâre noticing two or three of them it is probably a good sign
Think about how you would want to teach a small child If they feel safe calm comfortable and alert they are more likely to take instruction effectively The same is true for your parrot   Find a quiet space where you and your avian student can focus on the task at hand Choose somewhere familiar to the bird so it will already have a level of comfort before training startsDonât try to train when the parrot is overly agitated Wait for a calmer moment However training with treats works best when the bird is hungry so training before mealtime is usually the best scenario  While parrots are often quite friendly and caring they are not in general known for being overly patient Delays and mistakes during training sessions may not go over well so preparation beforehand is important   Gather up the supplies you will need for they type of training you will be conducting These might include items like a handheld perch a towel a clicker if âclicker trainingâ a chopstick or drumstick if âtarget trainingâ a leashharness if taking training outdoors bitter apple spray to make common areas of parrot nibbling like draperies unappealing and of course treatsChoose a treat that your parrot especially enjoys and also that you can easily feed to your bird Thin apple wedges for example can make a good hand treat for a parrot Weâve all heard that old dogs have trouble learning new tricks and the same principle holds true for just about any animal including parrots and people for that matter   Begin the process of training your bird as soon as possible So long as your parrot has reached the point of being capable if not yet entirely willing to eat a treat from your hand you can begin trainingHold multiple training sessions during the day ideally at similar times each day for consistency but more importantly when the parrot is in the mood for learning that is calm However keep the sessions relatively short â no longer than fifteen minutes at a time Once your bird begins to lose interest it is best to end the session and begin again another time Rewarding your bird with a treat from your hand is essential to practically every type of parrot training out there It also helps establish a bond between you and a new andor young parrotStart the process with the parrot inside its cage Slowly approach and present the treat Stay calm and offer only encouraging approval when the bird eventually takes the treat Apple slices again make a good treat option if youâre worried about having your fingers nibbled upon You can also wear gloves if you so choose though your bird may find those even more appealing to peck at   âShapingâ is a training ideology that focuses upon rewarding the bird for approximations and eventually deliberate acting of the steps required to complete a training taskShaping is wellnamed for it is all about molding behaviors through positive reinforcement As one example if you were teaching your parrot to bathe itself in a small water dish you would reward the bird for among several other intermediary steps looking toward the dish looking at the dish moving toward the dish moving to the dish testing the water stepping into the water and eventually splashing around   Pets ranging from birds to cats can often benefit from âclicker trainingâ which involves using a handheld clicking device think of the sound a pen clicker or metal juicebottle cap makes to indicate proper behavior worthy of a rewardThe âclickâ serves as an audible cue that an appropriate response has occurred and should occur immediately upon said response and be accompanied immediately by a reward Thus you may hear the phrase âclick and treatâ to describe what is essentially a single maneuver For instance if using a clicker during âstep up trainingâ â as detailed elsewhere in this article â the âclick and treatâ would occur immediately upon the parrot stepping up onto your fingerhand Clicking can be incorporated into virtually any training program   Another training option which can be used in combination with a clicker if desired is known as âtarget trainingâ It uses a birdâs natural curiosity in investigating new objects to build a reliable responseIn a basic version of target training a chopstick drumstick or other wooden wand is pointed in the vicinity of the parrot and any contact with the tip is immediately rewarded with a treat or âclick and treatâ if desired Slowly over time the parrot will learn to follow the target throughout the cage and around the room in the process learning to obey a simple command promptTarget training builds a key basic skill therefore that serves as a gateway to more specific training   As the name indicates this skill involves your bird learning to step or hop from one perch to another as directed with the target perch usually your hand finger or handheld perch such as a dowel rod   The step up is an ideal skill to teach early on for several reasonsIt is relatively easy to master for both teacher and student It derives from a natural parrot behavior the desire to move from perch to perch It is practical as having your bird hop into your hand on command makes everything from playtime to cagecleaning easier It leads into other more detailed skills as a basic maneuver   While the step up is a simple skill there are numerous training methods of varying complexity from which to choose a few of which are described in the following steps   If your new bird has some prior training experience or just a natural inclination the simplest training option may be sufficientOffer your finger or wrist to your parrot depending on the birdâs size and your preference placing it in front of the bird at midbreast level Many birds will naturally step up onto the new perch without any coaching at all Create a cue for the behavior either by saying âstep upâ or employing a clicker simultaneous to the parrot making its move Reward the bird immediately as well If the bird does not step up unprompted employ âshapingâ and reward incremental behaviors such as touching the perch with the beak placing one foot on the perch etc   In this method you use the treat more as a lure to coax the desired behavior but the basic training principles are quite similarHold the treat in one hand and offer the other handfinger to the bird at chest level Orient your hands so that the easiest way for the parrot to reach the treat is by stepping up onto the offered perch If your bird does not immediately step up reward any contact with the offered perch at first and incrementally reward only the desired stepup behavior If youâre handy enough with the clicker to use it while both hands are occupied it can be incorporated andor a verbal cue like saying âstep upâ   If other methods have been less successful or you have been utilizing target training already you can teach the stepup by employing the familiar target and reward systemHold your familiar target â a wooden drumstick for instance â in one hand and your desired perch your finger hand or handheld perch in the other Alternatively if your manual dexterity is up to the task you can do both with one hand which leaves the other for holding treats a clicker etc Locate the target so that it directs the bird to the new perch which should be located in the common stepup position at the birdâs chest Immediately reward positive behavior and use the clicker or a verbal cue if desired Eventually the target will no longer be required to prompt the behavior   Especially for people new to parrot ownership talking is usually the first skill they think of teaching and of which they presume their bird will be able to master   The truth of the matter is every parrot is different and you should never acquire a bird â even of a breed known for talking â with the assumption that it will talk Some parrots will require little or no training to learn to talk and may in fact pick up words and phrases youâd prefer they not repeat   Excited utterances â such as things you might shout at the TV during a sporting event â are often more readily picked up by a parrot and theyâre listening more often than you may think So be careful what you say around them Parrots talk to other members of their flock and it is easier to establish yourself as part of your birds flock early in its life Therefore you are more likely to have success when starting with a baby birdUse a clear calm happy voice to repeat a simple word or phrase as you start the training process Think about how you would try to teach a human child to say Mommy Early in the process reward any sound then any approximately accurate sound and eventually a recognizable sound with an immediate treat   Repetition is the key element of training a parrot to talk Simply put the more times you say a word or phrase around a parrot the more likely it is to pick it up and repeat it   Train as often as you like Parrots will not tire of conversing with another member of their flock although you may Some experts recommend recording yourself saying a phrase and playing it back on a loop for the birdOf course by using this method you lose the personal interaction between the two of you
The simplest strategy for getting a guyâs attention is just to walk past him in the hall It may take several tries so if possible time it so that you walk by his locker once per day But there are some tricks to it   Keep your body language confident head held high shoulders back Try to feel good about the way that you look and have a smile on your face You dont want to seem like you are trying to get his attention so donât stare Ask a friend to walk and talk with you so that you donât seem obvious Your conversation may also catch his attention You may want to practice walking at home until you feel comfortable   After you have done a few âwalkbysâ the next phase in your plan should be to try and lock eyes with him for a few seconds This might be his first clue that you are interested in him Donât stare at him longingly or try look too eager Just lock eyes for three seconds and then look awayGlance at him the next time you walk by Try to catch his eyes during class Smile if you see him at an assembly or in the lunchroom   Once you have successfully made eye contact you need to find reasons to talk to him Fortunately school provides lots of opportunities for that Think about upcoming school events or shared activities to get ideas for things talk to him about Before you talk to him rehearse what you will say so that you donât get flustered in the momentYou might say âI missed class last Friday Do you have the English notesâ Ask âDo you know when our permission slips are dueâ or âDo you know the date today Plan what you will say after he answers For example you could introduce yourself and thank him for his help   A cute dress or funky sweater might be enough to get his attention Choose a fun outfit and save it for a day when youre feeling extra confident Be sure to walk by his locker on that day

Most friends touch in some way but if youâre interested in more you can start by slowly increasing â or changing â the type of physical contact you have Youâre probably the best judge of what type of contact your friend will be comfortable with and youâll also know what level of physical contact already exists between you   Try placing your head on their shoulder while you sit next to them If they donât move away or if they put an arm around you this is probably a pretty good sign that theyâre interested in more than friendship tooIf your friend tenses up or otherwise signals that they are not comfortable with increased contact draw back immediately Aside from possibly ruining your friendship unwanted physical contact is inappropriate   If things seem to be progressing well there will probably come a point when you want to turn your friendship into a more physically intimate relationship You should take transitioning from a friendship to a physically intimate relationship slowly   Talk often about the level of intimacy you are both comfortable with and do so before you transition to a different level of intimacy For example you can say something like Ive been feeling like Id like to kiss you  is that okay Respect their response Its also perfectly acceptable for you to be the one to slow things down even if you initiated the change in relationship   You should demonstrate your feelings but you also donât want to smother your friend with your attempts to take your relationship to the next level Strike a balance between being available and keeping your distanceBeing available and willing to do anything and everything your friend asks might make your friend like you but it wonât necessarily increase their desire for you Surprising your friend occasionally with thoughtful gestures but also occasionally limiting the amount of time you spend with them sets up the perfect balance of satisfaction and tension In other words itâs okay to play a little hard to get A healthy romantic relationship takes time to develop even if it doesnât start platonically When youâre trying to turn friendship into romance it can really take time for that transformation to be complete Be patient

That is everyone fights in relationships sometimes In the heat of the moment you may decide its time to let the person go However if you take some time to cool down first you may realize that what happened isnt as much of a big deal as you made it You dont want to break up and then regret it a day or two laterDont hint at breaking up in your anger then leave If you have a huge argument its not a good idea to say or hint that you may want out and then leave Youll just leave your boyfriend or girlfriend upset and worried that you want to break it off even if you just want to work through the problems  When you do decide its time to break up dont just rush into the conversation Decide what you want to say first Establish why you want to break up and decide how you want to say that Choose a time when you know your boyfriend or girlfriend wont be busy Try not to pick a day before he or she has a big test or game Be considerate of his or her time and that that person has going onOn the other hand you dont want to hold off forever once you know the relationship should be over Try to pick a date where the other person is not busy but is not too far in the future   Its not nice to spread the news around before you tell the person because the news could get back to him or her In that case youve effectively broken it off through a rumor which isnt respectful at allThe exception to this rule is its fine to talk it over with one person you trust completely not to tell anyone else that person can help you decide exactly what youre feeling and what you need to do These types of conversations should be done in person not via the phone or texting It shows you respect the other person enough to tell them to his or her face Dont email or text the news Even a telephone conversation isnt the best Ask to see the person before you bring up the topicHowever you dont want to give any indication that the news could be bad beforehand as the other person will just worry about it until he or she can see you You dont want to tell someone youre leaving him or her when youre sitting in a coffee shop He or she is obviously going to be upset and most people dont like to be upset or crying where strangers can see him or her Therefore try to pick a place where you two can be alone In other words the best way to break up with someone is to face it head on It may seem heartless to tell your boyfriend or girlfriend in person that you dont want to be with them but doing so allows the other person to hear what you have to say and then begin the process of hurting and healingThe problem with other methods of breaking up such as drawing back from the person escalating the situation so he or she breaks up with your or using another person to do it such as setting your boyfriend or girlfriend up with someone else is that they create more drama and heartache in the long run They dont create a clean break or if they do they do it in a more dramatic wayIn addition talking to the person facetoface will give him or her a chance to ask questions It also give him or her a chance to talk it over with you allowing the person to work through some of his or her feelings A good way to open this conversation is to begin by talking about something you value about the person Even though youre having a sad conversation you dont need to start out with negativityFor example you could say Im so glad weve gotten to spend the time we have together I think youre a good person   That is when you use we to talk about the situation you invite a discussion about how you should move ahead If youve decided you want out you need to make it known that its your decision to do soFor instance you should say Ive decided that I need to step away from this relationship not I think we should break up When youre breaking up you dont need to go into how you see the other person as a failure In fact if you feel the need to talk about whats wrong discuss the problems you had with the relationship not the personFor instance you dont need to say something like I cant be with you anymore because youre a slob Instead talk about behaviors such as I dont feel like I can be in a relationship with you anymore because of the way you dont take care of your room and your personal things I feel like thats disrespectful to your parents and to me While even talking about behaviors can be mean it can give your boyfriend or girlfriend things to think about for the next relationship he or she has That is you obviously have cared about this person for awhile Just because youre ending the relationship doesnt mean you need to hate him or her Establish that while youll always care for that person you just dont want to have the same kind of relationship anymoreFor instance you could say Youre very important to me and I will always care for you However I dont think we can be together anymore   Even if you are ending it you can invite the person to talk about what he or she is feeling That gives the person a chance to respond to what youve said As an example you could say What are you thinking about what Ive said If you think that the other person still hasnt quite got the message its fine to be fairly blunt You dont have to be mean just straightforward such as I know you would like to continue on in this relationship but I dont I wish you all the best though Once youve broken up with someone dont talk bad about that person It reflects worse on you than it does on the other person plus you shouldnt throw hateful words at someone you once cared about That person deserves better Even if you broke up the relationship and even if it was the right thing to do youre still going to feel some sadness that its over Thats perfectly normal and youll need some time to get over it Give yourself as much time as you need
Maybe you are not trying to go out of your way to see your crush but you share a friend group and want to be friendly and cool with her you can use these steps to help create a good connection with her Or if you want to get into contact with your old crush and you canât or donât want to contact her directly hang out with the mutual friends you have and go to events she will probably be at   You can call your friends and ask them about the events and parties that are coming up and then attend those events Or if you know she goes to certain church activities for example you can start attending those activities again Donât use your friends to get to your crush For example when you hang out with your friends be there to have a good time with them first and consider seeing her second That way if it doesnât work out you will still have a good time and you wonât mistreat your friends   When you first see each other make sure you acknowledge her If you see her across the room give her a smile and a friendly wave or greeting If it doesnât seem like a good time to talk tell her âIt is great to see you I want to talk to you Can you give me a minuteâ You can finish doing what you are doing and let her finish doing what she is doing too   Giving yourself a minute will help you compose yourself and can add a good element of anticipation for your conversation Think about an interesting topic of conversation or something that you can ask her about as an ice breaker before you walk up and talk to her For example you can make an observation about the party you are at by saying something like âI like that they really made sure that all of our chip needs are met at this partyâ Then gesture to a table covered in 10 different types of chips   Once she is free to talk start a conversation If you are somewhere where it is difficult to talk ask her âDo you want to find a better place to talkâ Look for somewhere quiet and relaxed where you sit down and catch up uninterrupted   If you two have any awkward history together break through that barrier by expressing your positive feelings at seeing her again Once you two are settled show her that you are happy to see her again by smiling making eye contact and simply saying âI am happy to see youâ Being positive and direct will make you seem confident and can help overcome any weirdness either of you might feel at the start of the conversation   Use your tone of voice and hand gestures to show her that you are interested in hearing about her This will make you seem confident and happy to talk to her again It can be a little less intimidating if you ask her how she is doing now because having to recount everything that has happened since the last time you saw each other might require a lot of explanation   Say something like âIâd love to her how you are doing nowâ Or you can start by saying what you remember of what she was doing last For example you can say âIf I remember right the last time we talked you wereââ Avoid talking about anything awkward or difficult things from the past If the conversation progresses that way naturally you can talk about deeper topics but at the beginning of the conversation you want to keep it light and positive   When she tells you how her life has been listen attentively by making eye contact nodding along with what she says restating her main ideas and asking her relevant questions For example if she says she has been having a hard week ask her what has been going on that has made her week hard   Think of positive funny or lighter stories that will give her an idea of what you have been up to lately Consider talking about topics that you know she is interested in   For example if she loves marine biology you can say âI went on a trip with my school recently to Catalina Island and we had a blast snorkelingâ Mirror or match her energy level and body language in conversation For example if she is talking energetically and using lots of body language use lots of body language in response and laugh often Or if she seems a little more reserved you can talk quieter and give her more physical distance Donât copy her gestures however do go for a similar level of energy   After you feel like you have had a chance to catch up and made a good connection in your conversation tell her you really liked talking and ask her about getting together again After you have finished laughing about something for example you can say âI really liked talking with you again We should get together again and continue catching upâ   If she seems interested in going out with you make sure you have her correct contact information and arrange to get together to do something in the near future If she is ambiguous about whether she can hang out again donât push it It is better to let her tell you when she is free Sometimes people may be nervous in the moment and may come off uninterested and at other times they are sending you a message that they are not interested Send her a follow up message or text to find out which is the case   For example if she says something like âI donât know Iâm going to be busy for a whileâ You can say âNo problem it was really good catching up with you Iâm glad we got the chanceâ   If you got her information and you are going to get together soon you should send a follow up text sometime in the next couple of days that says something like âIt was really good catching up I am excited to hang out againâ If she seemed like maybe she wanted to hang out again then follow up with a simple message or text that says âIt was really awesome catching up with you let me know if you want to get together sometimeâ This kind of text is low pressure while also getting across that you are interested in hanging out more

Western and English saddles are measured a bit differently so before you make any measurements it is important to know what type of saddle you are looking for Additionally you want to examine the quality and style of the saddle differently depending on the type of work you plan on doing in it   Just as most saddles are built for the âaverageâ horse they are also built to fit the âaverageâ rider If you are very tall petite overweight or any number of things that affect the overall sizeshape of your body you may need to get a special saddle Just remember that when you sit in a saddle the following should occur   There should be a four inch space from your body to the front of the swellpommel You should never be sitting so that you are resting against the cantle or the swellpommel Your stirrups should fit comfortably without forcing too much bend in the knee   Sit in a regular chair with your back against the chair back and your feet on the floor Use a soft measuring tape and measure the distance from your kneecap to the crease in your hip This can be used in a size converter to determine the size of your saddle   Use your measurement to determine the seat size and therefore the saddle size of an English saddle The measurementsize approximately equates as   A legseat measurement of 165inches or less equals a 15inch saddle A legseat measurement of 165â185 inches 419â470Â cm equals a 16inch saddle A legseat measurement of 185â20 inches 470â508Â cm equals a 165inch saddle A legseat measurement of 20â215 inches 508â546Â cm equals a 17inch saddle A legseat measurement of 215â23 inches 546â584Â cm equals a 175inch saddle A legseat measurement larger than 23 inches 584Â cm will fit an 18inch or 19inch saddle The measurement of seat is a bit different for western saddles than it is for English saddles The easiest conversion is to subtract two inches from the size of your English saddle and youâll be left with the size of your western saddle Use the following chart to determine your Western saddle size based on your legseat measurement   A legseat measurement of 165inches or less equals a 13inch saddle A legseat measurement of 165â185 inches 419â470Â cm equals a 14inch saddle A legseat measurement of 185â20 inches 470â508Â cm equals a 15inch saddle A legseat measurement of 20â215 inches 508â546Â cm equals a 155inch saddle A legseat measurement of 215â23 inches 546â584Â cm equals a 16inch saddle A legseat measurement larger than 23 inches 584Â cm will fit an 17inch or 18inch saddle When youâve gotten your measurement you can compare that to the seat size of a saddle to determine if it is in your size range To measure the seat of an English saddle measure from one of the ânailsâ to the left or right of the pommel straight back to the center of the cantle This will give you the size of the saddle for example 16inches   Similar to sizing your seat the measurement of a western saddle seat is different from an English saddle seat Using a tape measure or a ruler measure straight from the base of the pommel to the stitching in the seat Go to the base of the pommel and measure in a horizontal line straight back   Be careful not to touch the saddle pommel when you measure the seat as the angle of it will give you too large of a measurement Go to just the base of the pommel along the stitching   Although your legseat measurement and saddle size can be a good indication of a wellfitting saddle the only way to tell if a saddle truly fits is to sit in it Try out many different saddles in several different styles to find the best fit and comfort level according to your personal preference Be sure to adjust the stirrups to their proper length every time you try on a saddleIt is better to go with a saddle that is a bit too large than one that is a bit too small It will be less painful for the horse and easier for you to ride Bring a trained friend or two along to make sure you are sitting properly in the saddle
If you have the time and money this is perhaps the best option In many warm weather locales there are guides who for a fee will take you to a local group of dolphins and help you interact with them Often such tours are led by scientific experts who can teach you or your children about our dolphin friends and their habitat   Examples of such programs include Discovery Cove in Orlando Dolphin Quest in Hawaii Dolphinaris in Cancun Dolphin Cay in the Bahamas and the Dolphin Research Center in Marathon FloridaIf you did go on a guided dolphin tour verify that it is legitimate and has a good safety record  Sometimes you can pet dolphins without making a long hike to the ocean by visiting the local aquarium The National Aquarium offers special packages for those who want to get close to a dolphin under professional supervisionThe same is true for some theme parks like SeaWorld Dolphins can be found in oceans throughout the world Some places however are better than others for finding wild dolphins The Azores has the greatest variety of dolphin species and dolphins there frequently come close to shore New Zealand and the Bahamas should also be on the top of the list for any tourist hoping to see dolphins in their natural habitatWhile visiting a beach alone keep your distance from dolphins You can appreciate them from afar but will put yourself at risk if you approach too close   While it might seem like more fun to swim with the dolphins the best way to interact with a dolphin is to protect them from danger Some species of dolphin are endangered due to overfishing global warming and human encroachments on their habitatThrough a conservationist group you can adopt a dolphin get updates on dolphin issues or lobby government to protect endangered species   In some places humans try to interact with dolphins so frequently that it disrupts their natural behavior As a result it is illegal to feed or approach a wild dolphin in many countries including the United States Dolphins are large powerful creates who can and occasionally do hurt humans Restrictions on humandolphin interaction therefore are typically in the interest of both parties If you are visiting dolphins in their natural habitat get into the water no less than fifty feet from them You should never attempt to approach a dolphin alone Better yet do this with someone who is properly trained to interact with wild dolphins and knows how to read dolphin reactions   Let the dolphin approach you Dolphins are easily scared and may get defensive and territorial They will view you swimming up to them as aggressive behavior While you might feel the urge to approach them they are more likely to be friendly if they find you to be nonthreatening   If the dolphins are smacking the water with their tail leaping and spinning or exhaling loudly in quick bursts they are probably agitated Back away and consider leaving the area Dolphins can be dangerous if aggravatedLeave immediately if you see a mother with small babies Such an interaction can cause considerable distressAlso pay attention to swimming patterns If the dolphins are diving for an extended period of time or if they are making abrupt changes in the speed or direction of their swimming that are probably upset When touching dolphins in captivity be aware that they are sensitive Their skin is delicate and can easily be hurt by our fingernails Areas that are particularly sensitive include the blowhole eyes snout lower jaw and melonPetting a dolphin in the wild is not recommended While watching a dolphin from a distance might be alright any invasive activity might scare the dolphin away from its natural habitat Stay at least fifty feet away and leave within thirty minutes Unless you are in a controlled setting with a guide who says otherwise you should keep your distance and watch the dolphins in their natural habitat You should feel free to do this either snorkeling or in a boat As long as you do no see any of the aforementioned signs of agitation and do not stay in their space for more than thirty minutes the interaction should be safe for all parties
They may be able to give you advice on how to approach your crush as well as help you make plans Although you shouldnt completely accept their words its nice to have some people that you can rely on   If you spot your crush nearby talk with your friends about a topic that your crush may like For instance if theyre obsessed with lacrosse and your friend happens to play the sport ask your friend some questions about it Your crush might jump into the conversation If youre focusing on subjects that youre unfamiliar with be sure to do your research beforehand so that you have the right facts   Itll not only help you gain information about your crush but also show that you can get along with people However its recommended that you form authentic relationships so that you dont appear fake Otherwise people might feel that you manipulated them for your own benefit   Avoid simply using them Treat them as if theyre your friends and they might invite you to hang out with them
The beautiful thing about technology making mistakes is that we can use this as a very believable excuse even if its not trueTry this common problem âI lostdropped my phone and lost all of my contacts Text me your number so I have itâ For an excuse that works anywhere and anytime try âI canât find my phone Will you call it for me so I know I didnât lose itâ If you have an opportunity to catch a cool photo together you can even say âMy phone is out of space can I use yours and send it to myselfâ This is also a good way to get his Instagram handle   School is the easiest and most believable excuse to get a boyâs number if you have classes together   Ask him if he can help you with your homework sometime  DO NOT pretend youâre bad in a subject in the style of Cady Heron from Mean Girls just to have an excuse to talk to a guy If heâs the one who could use some help say âMaybe we could study together sometimeâ   If youre both working on a group project or other assignment you can use this excuse to ask him for his number for a simple reason like so I can text you if I have a question   This is going to put him on the spot while also showing your carefree and independent sideâA few of us are getting together this weekend to see a movie Text me if youâre interested Gotta goâ This should prompt him to say âWait I donât have your numberâ If he doesnât think of that fast enough heâll find a way to get your number If he doesnât find a way youâre better off without him
Before you strap a saddle on your horse its important to ensure that your horses hair is clean and that he does not have any sores on his skin   Use a curry comb to detangle dirt mud and any other debris that might be matted in your horses hair Do not use the curry comb over any bony parts of the horses body as these may be more sensitive and could be injured by aggressive combing Do not curry comb the neck and face Use a stiffbristled body brush also called the dandy brush to continue dislodging hardtoremove debris and remove the debris youve already dislodged You can use this brush on the neck chest and legs Use a soft brush to gently flick away the debris removed by the curry comb and the body brush Use this brush to do the face and legsFinish things off by gently wiping down your horses face and body with a clean grooming cloth  Inspect the saddle and pad for any foreign objects that could cause irritation to your horse Its important to position the saddle pad properly as this will be the barrier between your saddle and the horses skin   Put the saddle pad on the withers shoulders slightly forward of where you want it to end up The saddling process will inevitably drag the saddle pad back so starting slightly forward should allow the saddle and pad to end up where you want them Never slide the saddle pad forward on your horses back for you will cause the hair to go against the grain and make it uncomfortable for the horse Lift the saddle in such a way that none of these attachments will get caught under the saddle If you have a hard time lifting the saddle you may need to request assistance during this step   Stand next to your horses left shoulder Keep your feet shoulderwidth apart with your left foot near the horses left hoof and your right foot slightly behind your leftSwing your torso and hoist the saddle up so that your right arm ends up draped across the horses back This should land the saddle right on the saddle pad on your horses back Allow them to hang down across your horse   Snug the front cinch also called a girth This should be done on your horses left side and should snug your saddle into place Its important to keep the back cinch tight as this will keep the saddle from lifting up during riding Some saddles do not have a back cinch Despite what the picture depicts please assure that the girth is hooked on before you start with the other cinches There are a number of different types of breast plate and each one will require different assembly instructions   Ensure that the breast collars center cinch strip is aligned with the center of your horses stomach Thread the latigo from the left side through the ring on the end of the cinch and D ring twice Pull tightly then thread the latigo around the back of the D ring to the left around front then back through The end should then come through the middle of the D ring and thread down behind the loop made like tying a tie pulling tightly again   One way of doing this is by gently bending your horses front two legs at the knees stretching out the belly and freeing any flesh that may have been caught in the cinches Be sure that your saddle is properly attached before you untie your horse   Most horses are accustomed to being mounted from the left and may become frightened if you attempt to mount from the right Before mounting ALWAYS check the tightness of the cinch or girth

If you look at her and shes already looking back at you smile at her Girls like it when the guy makes the first move Hold the eye contact just for a second then smile at her If she likes you shell smile back If she doesnt like you shell give you a weird look or turn away   Smile with your eyes and make sure you have white teeth and a nice breath Dont use the smile test unless you guys know each other Dont try this with a crush that doesnt know you Note a smile and a cheesy grin are not the same thing A cute grin is okay  Start with something simple like Hey how was your weekend or if its nearer the end of the week Hey got anything planned for this weekend   If she likes you shell keep the conversation going by asking you questions about your weekend and youll get into her life If she just mumbles something like It was fine and then goes back to what she was doing shes probably not interested   A lot of guys think that if they talk to a girl a lot then theyll think hes pathetic or clingy but thats just not true Girls love it when you hang out with them and actually try to talk about all sorts of topics   Try to relate to what she says but dont try to be someone youre not   Dont daydream while she is talking shell hate that and find it a turn off   This is vital before continuing on with the next steps You can only keep testing her interest if you are good friends So become good friends   Find out all that you can about stuff like that   If she likes you this will turn into a conversation because shell ask you what your interests are too If she doesnt like you it will sound more like an interview It sounds creepy if youre just sitting there asking her all these questions and shes responding with oneword answers If this is the case stop the conversation immediately   Make sure you know each other a lot before you try this or it will totally backfire   Sneak up on her from behind and gently grab her waist Dont squeeze her skin or anything just put your hands on her waist and leave them there She may freak out a little at thisââremember someone has just sneaked up on her and put their hands around her waist If she jumps slightly or screams and turns round say Its only me and then smile Do not laugh Keep your hands on her waist If she likes you shell smile back and maybe giggle a little bit then return to her original position Your hands should still be on her waist Notice whether or not she leans in closer to you If she does tighten your grip ever so slightly but then let go If she is not interested shell probably just laugh and walk away If you two are shy friends shell probably ask why youre doing this and how do you explain that Have a ready answer prepared beforehand such as I was just feeling affectionate   Note only attempt this if the waist grab test was successful Go up to her and hug her for no apparent reason Make sure you hug her gently not like you would with one of your guy friends Put your hands on her upper back steering well clear of her bra and slowly rub your hand in upanddown or circular motions If shes interested shell hug you back   Notice whether her chin is resting on your shoulder If it is theres some chemistry there Rest your chin on her shoulder too and bow your head a little bit so it looks like youre looking at the ground If she doesnt hug you back and moves away shes not interested   If youre lucky enough to sit together in a class attempt to hold her hand But this has to be done very carefully Make sure her hand is off the table and resting on her seat If shes right handed sit on the left side of her If shes left handed sit on the right side of her Slowly move your hand towards hers and gently touch her wrist She may jump a little at first remember this girl may like you   If she doesnt pull away take your hand off her wrist and touch her hand Attempt to hold her hand by slowly sliding your fingers in between hers If she likes you she will definitely hold your hand back If she does try to stay holding hands for the remainder of the lesson   If she has a strand of hair in her face gently tuck it behind her ear   If shes interested shell likely smile If shes not interested shell likely move away   If this girl does like you back seeing you flirt with another girl will just make her feel stupid She wont know youre doing it to see what her reaction is shell think youre doing it because you have a crush on the girl youre flirting with   If you reach something out for her to take see if she gently touches your hand before she takes it This may be a sign of her eagerness to get closer to you   Beware It could just mean she bumped you by accident   These are all possible signs that shes nervous and may mean that shes interested in you   If not it could mean she is nervous or just doesnt make eye contact or doesnt like you   These include Blushing complimenting you often giggling making excuses to hang around you teasing you staring but looking away quickly when caught hugging you and whispering to friends when you walk by
Timing is everything as the old saying goes Make time for a casual exchange when both of you arent preoccupied with something else   Try to get him alone If hes surrounded by friends he might respond based on their presence and not based on how he actually feels Dont worry if you cant catch him alone though â just quietly ask if he has a minute to chat privately Dont rush You dont want to be nervous or hurried Asking him as youre trying to sprint to class or hes on his way to an appointment is a recipe for disaster Instead choose a time when you have some flexibility like after school or at lunch Pay attention to his mood If he seems particularly grumpy or quiet it might be best to wait for another chance  This may feel tough but it can be surprisingly simple An openended question that does not have a yesno answer is a safe place to start   Ask about his upcoming plans What are you doing this weekend I wanted to Ask his thoughts on a common experience teacher friend class etc Did you see I thought that was What did you think   Open attentive positioning will get your point across â perhaps without even saying it    Lock eyes Eye contact will tell him that you are listening to him and you care Shying away from eye contact shows youre nervous and less approachable Posture Make sure your body is open and pointed toward him Tilt your hips toward him if standing and make sure your arms arent crossed  Touch Make excuses to touch him in appropriate light ways The bond of human touch subconsciously puts humans more at ease Lightly lay your hand on his forearm as youre talking or gently bump into his side if youre walking together Mirror his positioning Getting into a physical groove with him will tell him you are similar Humans are programmed to seek out those like us   Always always always smile Not only will it make him happier to be around you itll up your mood too   When the big reveal comes remember to relax After all hes just one person like you Heres how to get through it with grace   A nonthreatening idea is to pad it with another statement  Sarah was asking who I thought would go to State this year I told her I liked you and thought youd make it You failed the history exam Oh that sucks I didnt do too great either But dont worry I still really like you   If youre good friends a more straightforward approach is fine  We have tons of fun together I like you so much You may want to ask it back I think Im starting to like you Do you feel the same     Be prepared for what he says good or bad If hes a decent person he wont want to hurt your feelings   If he doesnt like you back thats fine You were brave for trying Be proud of yourself To avoid feeling awkward leave on a happy note  I understand I still want to be friends though Youre so funny I have to get home I just wanted to let you know Ill see you in gym Ill kick your butt in basketball tomorrow   If he doesnt give you a definite response revisit the conversation at a later date He may need time to figure out how he feels Give the subject space and revisit it in a few days If he says he likes you back stay cool This is not the time to attack him with your kisses Smile continue the conversation and find a time you two are free to spend together
Guinea pigs are one of the very few mammals along with humans who cant make their own vitamin C so they need to get it from their food They need 10  30 MG of Vitamin C dailyVegetables that are high in vitaminC and that are good for your guinea pig include dark leafy greens bell peppers broccoli and cauliflower   Guinea Pigs are highly prone to getting scurvy which is a disease caused by low levels of Vitamin C You can supplement your guinea pigs vitaminc intake Putting vitaminc into your guinea pigs water is not recommended Adding vitamin C to the water can cause a guinea pig to stop drinking water if they dont like the taste In addition its hard to control how much vitamin C your guinea pig is getting as they may drink a little or a lot of water   This includes large amounts of fruits with high sugar contents they should only be given in moderation and any starchy vegetables such as potatoesVegetables to avoid feeding your guinea pigs include iceberg lettuce rocket salads red leaves cauliflower beet greens potatoes and radishes Feed fruit in small quantities Not only does fruit have a high sugar content but it may also have a low calcium to phosphorus ratio which could lead to bladder problems and possible diarrheaThis is true in fruits such as raisins Avoid giving your guinea pig citrus fruits altogetherGuinea pigs are herbivores This means that they should not be fed any meat or dairy products These are a waste of money and are not good for your pet Your guinea pig would like a treat of a piece of apple or rolled oats much more than a commercial treat filled with sugar and the natural treat is much better for them These kind of additions to your pets diet are not necessary if you take the time to feed your guinea pig well If you do need to feed your guinea pig supplements consider giving it vetapproved supplements that are high in fiber   Guinea pigs chew instinctively and will eat as much as you feed them throughout the day Watch how much you give them and stick to a balanced diet Explain this gently to small kids who own guinea pigs so that they do not overfeed their pets   Guinea pigs will chew on anything they can get their teeth on including their food dishes Opt for a heavy ceramic dish that cant be easily be overturned and wont be easily destroyed Uneaten food should be removed promptly within one day Guinea pigs can be picky eaters so keeping food in their cage longer will probably not make it any more appealing to them If they have avoided it for a whole day they are probably never going to eat it and it will just simply become a mess in their cage   This means that the amount of food you feed your guinea pig may need to change over time to keep them in good health   Dont allow the water bottle to become empty If a guinea pig doesnt have access to water it can become very ill   The best water bottles are designed for guinea pigs or rabbits and have a metal ball in the spout If your guinea pigs lives in a pen outside make sure that the water doesnt freeze during the winter Clean the water bottle nozzle frequently with a Qtip to keep it free of obstructions and food residue Clean the water bottle itself by placing uncooked rice and a little water in the bottle and then shaking it vigorously The rice will dislodge any greenish algae buildup   If you have a lawn that you know does not have chemicals on it and is not used by by other pets for urinating and defecating you can let your guinea pig graze on it Get a fully enclosed outdoor run and let your guinea pig roam around in it during warm weather Just make sure there is no breeze and the temperatures are between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit 1524 degrees Celsius   Only allow them outdoors in a run when supervised While some guinea pigs do live in pens outdoors they should not be left in an openair pen without supervision This could leave them exposed to predators or allow them to escape Make sure they have a dark place for them to hide in from the sun or if something scares them Move the run around from daytoday Guinea pigs will keep your lawn nice and short and they fertilize it too
It is critical that you do adequate research before buying the pet Different animals have different needs regarding care for example tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish and even within the same species different breeds can have different needs   If you are buying a dog then buying a high energy large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day Focus on the pets needs not your wantsIf you want an animal like a snake instead research is still important It is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source such as a lightbulb If youre leading an active life choose a dog If you are away from home a lot though choose a cat or some other freeroaming animal If you just want an animal to look at and dont want to interact with it directly or dont have lots of time choose a fish or a snake or other creepycrawlies  Itâs a mistake to just decide âI want a dogâ or any other animal and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed   Some breeds are natural shepherds which makes them great for 1 person but some breeds Border Collie for example have the sheepherding instinct in their blood This means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the herd the collie will try to get it back How does it do it with the sheep It bites them This may result in grave injuries to children Please do your research on how breeds behave It is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable safe and provided with what it needs Some animals are very adaptable such as cats which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers while others have more specific needs For example horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter For animals that will roam the house not being confined to tanks or cages they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic where they can lie without being disturbed such as the corner of a room If they are a cat that will often be shut indoors then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out   Some pets are more expensive than other pets and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet  and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it   Costs associated with pets include setup supplies Depending on the kind of pet you might need a crate an aquarium and leashes Donât forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet You need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care like shots not just emergency care Thats essential to keep the pet healthy and it can be quite costly   Figure out the exercise needs if any of the pet before you buy it and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet themSome pets dont require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about such as buying a run for a rabbit and making sure the tank is large enough for fish But other pets must be exercised Dogs require a more handson approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly Making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors   Many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals making them ill when they consume them so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat   Overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra For some animals dietary requirements may change with the season for example if you have horses or other grazing animals they will often require more hay during the seasons when there is less grass Look at pet food labels to make sure you are purchasing food for your pet that is properly nutritious Research which food could harm your pet It is vital that all pets have a constant water supply Check water bowls at least once a day to ensure that they have enough water and that the water is clean and not contaminated   Many animals will largely take care of themselves only really needing to be groomed or bathed when they manage to get very messy Others such as longhaired dogs or cats may need regular grooming   It is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age When brushing fur ensure any brush used on the face is soft and if brushing long tangled fur take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging You can buy brushes for pets at pet stores When bathing your pet make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction  buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals Consider taking your pet to a professional groomer if you arenât sure you are competent to do it You donât want to accidentally injure the pet   As pets cannot tell us when they are ill or injured it is up to us to keep an eye on them and look out for any signs of injury   Knowing your pets normal behavior is very important if they are sick or injured they will often act unusually such as sleeping more going off their food etc If they begin to act oddly check them for any injuries and keep an eye on their food and water intake if they stop eating or drinking or they have obvious wounds that are concerning you then take them to the vet Make sure that your pet has all of the proper vaccines and other preventative medication suggested by your veterinarian such as heart worm pills for some dogs   A major part of caring for a pet is training Training is essential for the safety of the animal and the people who interact with itIf you have an apartment cat the litter box is very important from the start You have to teach your cat to use the litter box and to think of it as its only place to do the necessary businessThe litter box needs frequent cleaning once or twice a day depending on the catFeeding is approximately 2 or 3 times a day again depending on the cat Water should be supplied continuously Dogs need to be trained so they understand proper behavior such as where to go to the bathroom and not to jump on people when they enter the house Itâs important that the owner establishes control but never in an abusive or harmful way to the animal   Some animals require more attention than others so the amount of time they need is often relative Just be sure than you are capable of fulfilling whatever that need may be   Try to take a little time out of each day to spend with your pet even if its just sitting down with them More often than not your pet would be more than happy to relax with you Dogs should be walked and hamsters need time to run around in their ballsPlay should be fun for both your pet and you but make sure it is safe and monitored at all times Research whether your pet breed needs to socialize with other animals Play with it  dogs are very social animals so they need to spend time with their owners With toys or simply chasing him around is enough for exercising Dogs have a natural craving for chewing things so buy a chewing toy to keep him entertained   Love is what your relationship with your pet has to be about Show him or her your affection by petting and playing   Your pet will be a member of your family so treat it like one A good cuddle will do the both of you good Pets respond to the tone of peoples voices as well as touch Horses need attention Like wild horses if you dont love them properly they pretty much turn into mustang Give them a treat once in a while take a walk with them or ride them for fun Train a pet with positive reinforcement never cruelty or abuseKeep your pet and its environment clean If you have a small animal clean their cage weekly Youre not showing your pet love if you let it sit in filth If you have a dog vacuum fur regularly from the house and wash their dog bed from time to time Neglecting to clean your pet could result in infection so keep on top of its cleanliness
Not only do you need to make a nice living space for your animals before you even get them but you need to follow and most often exceed local or federal laws about minimally required spaces for each species   Depending on the type of exotic pet find an empty pasture or clear a space on your property thats about one acre long Fence the area and remove any hazardous items Buy or make a gate for the front of the pasture Then build a shelter for them to sleep and escape from rain hail snow and other adverse weather conditions Make sure its the right height especially for a llama a good house for an exotic animal is about 10 feet 30Â m by ten feet Several animals can fit in it Its easier to make it a threesided house so you dont have to mess with a door  This includes a place to store the food like a new metal trash can something to carry the food in like a pitcher and a hay feeders with several areas for eating with trays underneath to put the food in You can make one yourself or buy one at a farm store   Buy a padlock and secure the gate on the pasture Always keep the key in the same place and check the lock after each time you feed the animals   Make sure it doesnt have any cracks or holes in it rinse it out with a hose and watch your animals sip their drinks These should be emptied of contaminated water away from feeding areas scrubbed clean all over with a small amount of bleach and a stiff brush rinsed until you can no longer taste or smell any trace of bleach or fecal matter whatsoever and refilled with clean pure water   Clean the droppings out of the pasture animal housing common areas and especially feeding areas daily with a rake and snow shovel dumping it into a wheelbarrow Then rinse any wooden or paved areas with water and squeegee the area dry Dont make your animals sleep or live on wet floors no matter what the season Clear away all food left out the previous day from all areas before putting out fresh food and water Carefully clean all water containers that might have gotten droppings food or other contamination in them   Pet them every day and give them hugs and kisses Gently brush their fur and feed them out of your hand Make sure your animals have lots of safe interesting toys and other enrichment like new things to smell or play with everyday Dont leave enrichment with an animal for more than 3 4 days at a time and clean all toys etc thoroughly with a small amount of bleach lots of water and a stiff brush before storing it or giving it to any other animal Caring for exotic animals of any species is very hard work but when done with dedication and love can be a great experience for you and your animals   If it bites approach it carefully
This could send him mixed messages If you feel like youre going to cry think of something that makes you laugh to counter the tears If that doesnt work make an excuse that you have to be somewhere else and walk away Its okay to confide in your best friend but dont tell everyone that you think hes creepy or needy Less considerate friends might taunt him and make things awkward If anyone mentions that he thinks you like him say something like âWell hes nice and all but I only like him as a friendâ Dont worry if your friends think hes cute or sweet If he just doesnt do it for you that doesnt make you a bad person You cant force yourself to like him Celebrate this as something that makes you unique He might try to make you feel guilty for rejecting him Deep breathing will allow you to control your guilt and not dwell so much on his behavior Inhale slowly through your nose Exhale slowly through your mouth Focus on staying calm and doing whats best for you
If he does this simply means he doesnt know what to say to you because he doesnt want you to know that HE wants YOU BACK He just wants you to hang on to him  If he does then he digs you and is hiding his feelings UNLESS you have either texted him to much or if you were in person you could have been calling his name too much and he got annoyed with it In that case you should just leave him alone if he has already gotten fed up with you Let him cool down and hell want you back again and feel guiltysorry for being mean to you trust me on this one Please   If he sees you with other boys does he seem jealous or he doesnt care Does he do something to try to get your attention Or he ignores it   Is it ShockÂ O Anger or is it Guilt because he loves you and wants you back See his reaction to it   If sohe may not be in the mood for talkingor is thinking of a way to secretly get you back without knowing and avoiding could be one of the ways he is doing it to get you going and obsessed with him   If sohe may be jealous of the people that your giving attention to and is saying bad thingsfacts about you to turn them off and so they wont even want to hang out with you anymore   This is the most important step you need to follow This is the most important thing you need to check out How is he when you dont pay attention to him at all Even if its for just one day or a few days maybe even weeks or months see how he is with you     True Fact The saying goes on and on and on    Â P
Guinea pigs can be housed in three different types of cages C  C hutches or runs You can purchase these from warehousepet stores or build your own The cage must be at least 4 square feet for each guinea pig housed in it the more the better or at least 8 square feet for two  Dont fall into the trap of buying inappropriate sized cages from pet shops that do not hold enough space for guinea pigs If you want to keep your guinea pig indoors then a C  C cage is recommended Hutches are recommended if youre keeping your guinea outside The cage must have a solid floor Dont purchase one with a wired floor as guinea pigs have fragile feet Wire flooring can and will easily cause bumble foot Most C  C cages do not have lids If your cage is going outdoors you have small children or dangerous pets in the house then you will need a lid on your cage Do not use an aquarium for a cage as the glass sides dont provide good ventilation and most are terribly small  You will need two layers of bedding to ensure extra absorbency as guinea pigs tend to wee a lot Your first layer should be either newspaper or puppy pads which will take in any leaks and protect the flooring The second layer should be either wood shavings or fleece lined on top of the first layer  Fleece is more suitable for indoor cages such as C  C cages but will require more regular cleaning and possibly spot cleaning And cleaning the fleece is a bit more difficult as you will need to shake off and vacuum the fleece before washing it Wood shavings require less regular cleaning and is generally easier to clean Its also less smelly and more absorbent   You will want to keep the cage in an area where its safe secure and away from any toxins or dangerous pets Guinea pigs like somewhere that doesnt get too stressful or too noisy  somewhere that gets light traffic  Keep the cage out of direct constant sunlight Morning sun is adequate for guinea pigs but they prefer to keep out of constant sunlight Keep the cage away from any dangerous pets and small children Dogs and cats will easily scare your guinea pigs as would small children who arent supervised Do not keep the cage in a garage where toxic fumes are given off from cars This could be fatal to your guinea pigs   Water bottles are less messy but some do leak However bowls dont leak and are more natural to the guinea pig but if you use wood shavings expect to see some mess  Some guinea pigs prefer to drink from bottles whilst other like bowls as a more natural instinct Ask the previous owner of the guinea pigs to see which one they use Remember to never add vitamin supplements to your guinea pigs water as it isnt effective and your guinea pig could refuse to drink   Your guinea pig will need somewhere to eat Purchase two bowls  one for pellets and one for vegetables You should avoid chucking their food on the ground as its unsanitary Guinea pigs will need pellets and plenty of vegetables every day Pellets should be unlimited however whilst they need 1 cup of mixed vegetables a day each So make sure to plan ahead  Make sure to purchase plain pellets rather than a guinea pig mix Guinea pigs will pick out their favourite treats out of a mix which results to them not eating what they actually need You can also optionally purchase commercial treats if you plan on training your guinea pig However treats should be kept to a limit due to the high sugar content   Guinea pigs need an unlimited supply of hay as they are grazing animals If they arent constantly chewing on something their digestive tracts can shut down  Purchase a reliable good quality manufacture of hay such as oxbow andor timothy hay Alfalfa should only be fed to guinea pig pups and nursing or pregnant sows   An hay dispenser will lessen the mess of hay and make it last longer rather than scattering the hay on the floor You can purchase a hay dispenser from a pet shop or use a small paper bin instead A main criteria that needs to be met for guinea pigs is entertainment and comfort through toys and tunnels  You should have at least two hutstunnels or one huttunnel per guinea pig Guinea pigs like being hidden and need a place to run to when scared or in conflict You can build a crittersafe hut or find one at a pet store Some log tunnels even act as a double as they import into bridges due to their flexibility if tied together with string Toys are a great boredom buster for guinea pigs but make sure the toy you purchase is safe and has no negative reviews Some toys can be dangerous so watch out Something as simple to chew on could be a great and beneficial toy for your guinea pig and help grind down their large teeth
Simply avoiding places where he goes or hangs out if possible will send him a message If he never sees you he will likely stop thinking about you or trying to pursue you as much   Get on your social media accounts like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat and block him from seeing your posts and photos and interacting with you All of the major social network sites and apps have easy ways of unfriending and blocking any user you want Try asking his friends or using what you already know about what he doesnât like to make yourself less desirable to him If he hates a certain sports team start talking to him about only that team If the sound of chewing gum or humming drives him nuts start doing those things around him   An outthere move to try is acting the complete opposite and give him a lot of attention Be completely overbearing and demanding of his attention even acting like youâre already in a relationship Take it to a ridiculous level if you need to It may be that he just wanted the attention from you and will leave you alone once he gets it or he will be so turned off by your overattentiveness that heâll back off
Fresh breath is important for kissing because you want to give the boy as many excuses as possible to keep on kissing you Try using lifesavers or mints and always brush your teeth before you meet up with him Remember bad breath isnt the end of the world but avoid it if you can   Try not to eat strong spicy or garlicky food before you see him Again if you cant avoid it its not a huge deal but its better to avoid it altogether  You cant always plan when and where youll kiss a boy but you can try to be prepared If youre dressed pretty and in a way you feel comfortable youll have a spring in your step That means you will be more confident More confidence means that theres a bigger chance the boy comes back to kiss you again   Dont necessarily wear lipgloss and dont wear heavy lipstick Lipgloss and lipstick especially will rub off on your partner making him look sparkly or sloppy depending on the situation Stick with lip balm instead Dont wear a bunch of accessories like hats or wear your hair so that it gets in the way Boys like natural beauty anyway You may want to try kissing the boy when you have your hair up so that he focuses only on you and the kiss not the hair tickling his face   Public places are generally not so good for the first kiss as you can get people staring at you or even heckling you Try to find a place thats public but still intimate for you to share your first kiss   This will not only make him understand that you like him but will also give him some time to adjust to you so that youre not going from 0 to 60 in a second   Hold his hand or put your arms over his shoulders Start moving your body so that hes much closer to you itll be awkward if you have to move a long way to kiss him Touch his hair or face to make him know that you are interested Gently touch his nose with your pointer finger and smile at him You can even try hugging him first and while youre still hugging him lean back and go in for the kiss This creates a connection from the very moment you hug   This means both physically and emotionally Kissing says I like you more than just a friend and its sometimes hard to save a friendship after you have a relationship If youre not sure whether youre doing the right thing wait until you absolutely know   Look at him in the eye While hes watching you look slowly towards his lips and back again If he does the same to you then hes ready If he looks a bit uncomfortable and looks away its best to leave it for a while   You need to be able to see so that you can aim for his lips but you dont want to keep your eyes open while you kiss so close them right before your lips lock   Keep your eyes closed during the whole kiss When the kiss ends you can open your eyes and you gently pull away Move into the kiss at an angle That means if his face is straight up and down you probably want yours tilted a bit to the left or right â whichever is more comfortable This helps keep you from bumping noses together when you kiss   Dont pucker up your lips like youve just had a bunch of Sour Patch Kids or like youre kissing grandma Keeps your lips loose and try to relax   Give him one long kiss You dont have to do anything fancy to get his attention the first time Your big goal is to get him to come back for seconds Give him just enough so that hes interested not so much that hes bored Try to keep the first kiss to under 20 seconds if you can Breathe in and out gently through your nose Try not to breathe into his throat or onto his lips Dont French kiss on the first kiss The French kiss is an advanced kiss so save it for when you really want to blow his mind   This just means opening your lips a bit and maybe kissing his lower lip with both of your lips Dont make it last too long â about 5 seconds â and be prepared to pull away soon   That way you can get double the bargain If he puts his hands around your back or waist it means hes very protective of you and you could be onto a winner   If he plays with your hair or gently strokes your cheek its a sign that hes very intouch with his feeling and he definitely likes you Remember to try to keep your eyes closed the whole time No peeking Your attention should be entirely on his lips and the kiss   Now would be the time to take a look at the boy youve just shared a kiss with If you did a good job hell be flushed heavyeyed and smiling   Smile back at him He may be nervous about how he kissed so youll probably want to convince him that he did a good job You can do this by smiling If you arms are still around him leave them there for a few seconds before taking them away It might feel weird if you suddenly take your hands away as soon as the kiss is done   Sometimes the kiss itself is enough of a statement Sometimes youll want to say a little something after the kiss like   Youre a good kisser Ive been wanting to do that for a long time   So youve finally kissed the boy that youve been dying to kiss for the last six months What now You have several options   Wait for him to make the next move If you went in for the first kiss maybe you think its his turn to initiate the next kiss Be yourself do what you normally do but be friendly and encouraging around him He should try to kiss you again Kiss him whenever you want to Maybe you dont care that much about who kisses whom as long as theres kissing Thats fine just make sure that hes into it too Kissing him often is likely to lead to a relationship Break off the kissing Maybe he wasnt that good of a kisser or he touched you in the wrong place or you just get a bad feel from him Thats OK Try to still be friendly around him but dont put yourself in situations ie oneonone private setting where he could kiss you again   There are some unspoken rules that you should know about kissing Pay attention and try to follow them if you can and they make sense to you   Dont kiss and tell We know â its very easy to do That doesnt mean its right What goes on between you and your crush is between you and your crush Try not to gossip too much about it Dont kiss when you are sick and likely to spread germs Kissing is a very intimate thing but that doesnt mean that your kissing partner wants every single part of you including your cold Try not to kiss when you are feeling under the weather Kiss one person not everyone Kissing may be fun but that doesnt mean that it sends the right message to go out and kiss everyone you want Focus on one person you really like try things out and then move onto someone else if that doesnt work out Youll be appreciated a lot more and youll probably be happier
People tend to use Western style riding for rodeos and ranching and it is more common in the US than in other countries so you might have a harder time accessing Western equipment if you live somewhere that favors English style   One nice thing about the Western saddle is that it has the horn where you can grip onto if youre on an experienced rider   If this is the first time youre using this bit on this particular horse you definitely want to make sure that youre using the proper sized bridle If its the wrong size it will make the horse uncomfortableBridles comes in three sizes pony cob or Arabian and full Measure your horseâs head from the center of his poll to the corner of his mouth and compare this measurement to the crown and cheek piece of the bridle If the bit is too small it can pinch the horseâs mouth If the bit is too big it will slide around in the horseâs mouth   A horse can sense your fear and this will make them nervous Also remember that it can be nervewracking for a horse to have someone putting something metallic in their mouth   You need to make sure that your horse is secured This means anticipating the moment when they are halterfree but you havent yet buckle the bridle You have to be able to control and keep hold of your horse   For a tie station hold the bridle so that the front of the brow band faces forward away from the horse Drape the reins over their neck Drop your left rein over the horses neck so that it falls on the right Drop the right rein so that it falls on the left Allow the bridle to slip back on your arm Lift the crown of the halter over the horses ears and slip the halters nose band down off their face Bring the crown up and lay it behind their ears Refasten their halter so it hands around the horses neck If you dont have a tie station use the bridle reins to maintain hold of your horse For split reins tie them together and lift the reins over the horses head setting them just behind their ears Lift the halters crown over the horses ears and slip the halter nose band off your horses face   You can offer them a piece of apple or sugar cube to make them their head Put your hand right below their nose with the treat in it When they drop their head thats when youll put the bit in   Make sure youâre grasping the crown of the bridle in your right hand Angle in line with your horseâs left eye and right ear   Hold the bit low where youâve been holding the treats Gently set it against your horseâs teeth as close to where her top teeth meet her lower teeth as possible Hold your sugar cube against the bit  Make sure you put the bit in before you put the bridleâs crown over their ears Holding the crown of the bridle up in order to slip it on before you put the bit in their mouth Hold the bridle so that the two sides are a good distance apart with the crown up and the throatlatch straps hanging free and not tangled in any other straps   You want to be careful that you dont crush your horses ears Lift the crown over your horses left ear as you slip the crown to the poll Gently slip the horses right ear in front of the crown as well Also gently push the horses ears forward rather than backward   If the bridle has earloops rather than a brow band position these around your horseâs ears now   Always make sure that you reward your horse for their good behavior This will encourage them to be good about accepting the bit and the bridle   Sugar also encourages them to play with the bit so sugar cubes are a really good treat to have on hand for bridling   Remember that the throatlatch isnt there to hold the bridle in place It operates as an extra precaution against the bridle coming off This means that the throatlatch needs to be loose enough to maintain slack even if the horse drops their head   Make sure you can fit your entire hand between the throatlatch and the horse even when their head is bent towards their neck   The brow band should be smooth and in the correct position This means it wont be pinching your horses ears or head Check that the bit sits evenly in your horses mouth There should be two wrinkles on either corner of your horses mouth Too fewer and you need to shorten the cheek straps   Make sure it sits evenly on your horseâs head If you do have to adjust the cheek strap check that the rest of the headstall is still even Buckle curb chain or chin strap if that isnât fixed This is when you should check the length of your reins The need to be long enough that you can take up contact with your horses mouth   Lead them on their left at their cheek Hold the reins in your right hand about six inches below the bit Keep the bight in your left hand Always hold about six inches below the bit   Keep the slack from the reins in your left hand
Donât dwell on what might go wrong with the conversation Instead try to adopt a positive attitude before talking to your crushIf youâre feeling negative and discouraged think of ways to put a positive spin on these negative thoughtsFor example if you find yourself thinking about reasons why your crush might not like you think about reasons why she will like you instead   Have a friend give you a pep talk to boost your confidence The more optimistic you feel the more positive your experience will be  Everyone gets nervous Itâs your brainâs natural reaction to stimulating circumstances The trick is to channel your anxiety into excitement You can do this by repeating this positive mantra âIâm so excitedâ Repeating this phrase will help you gather energy from your anxiety instead of losing your nerveAny variation of âIâm so excitedâ will work For example you could say âIâm so pumped about thisâ   If you find yourself losing your nerve try to relax Practice a breathing exercise or

the conversation lags you can bring up a current event and talk about it together   Part of what makes reaching out to your crush so scary is that you have no control of the outcome He may respond or

mutual friend ask him to start a group text with a few people This will give you access to your crushâs phone number   After a few days of talking to the group âaccidentallyâ text your crush a particularly funny joke outside of the group text If you donât want to ask for a phone number in person you can ask over a social media platform such as Facebook or Instagram   Avoid calling during

amazing today Whatâs your secretâ âHow would you define yourself in three emojiâs or lessâ   Avoid talking about controversial weird or unpleasant topicsThese discussion topics bring negativity into your conversation Instead focus on fun experiences and shared interests You want your crush to have positive feelings about talking to you Otherwise he may not want to talk to you again For example

have a few things in common If possible skim her social media profiles to find some common ground Make sure you donât do too much research or youâll come across as creepyhowever you probably have more in common than you think Do you   Go to the same school Play the same sports Take the same classes Know the same people   Hopefully youâll have an interest in common with your crush giving you an easy conversation topic For example if you share a favorite class together ask your crush what he thought about the homework assignment If you focus on these mutual interests the conversation will flow naturally For example   âI also love playing video games Do you have any favoritesâ âThatâs my favorite soccer team too Do you have any game day traditionsâ âIf you tell me whatâs on your bucket list Iâll tell you whatâs on mineâ âI love that TV show Whoâs your favorite characterâ   Once your crush answers ask follow up questions This will give your crush an opportunity to talk about herself Ask questions that show you have a genuine interest in what she has to say For example   âWe just got back from France Whereâs the coolest place youâve ever beenâ âWhat are you passionate aboutâ âI wish I could go to Hawaii Whatâs your dream vacationâ âWhatâs your favorite classâ   Gauge when the conversation is over If there are long stretches of silence or the conversation becomes awkward politely excuse yourself If youâre texting and your crush doesnât respond immediately give him time to answerIf you bombard him with text messages hell start ignoring you and may even block your number   When in doubt keep your conversation under thirty minutes You want to intrigue your crush and leave him wanting more not exhaust him with your company

You should only tie a horse up with a rope connected to a wellfitting halter Tying a horse up by the bridle either directly to the bit or to the reigns can cause the horse pain and serious injury Only tie your horse to a solid object that the horse cannot break or pull over Horses are very strong and can pull with tremendous strength when frightened If you tie your horse to a fence or railing inspect the poles or rails and be sure to choose one that is not damaged or corroded Make sure the area in the immediate vicinity of the horse is clear of dangerous objects the horse might step on or run intoIf you must tie your horse to something the horse ââcouldââ break tie a loop of string around the object and then tie the horseâs rope to the string instead of the object itself If the horse does decide to make a break for it this will minimize property damage   Make sure to tie your horse up far enough away from other horses that they cannot fight It is best not to tie your horse up around other horses at all until it is used to being tied Do not tie the horse to an object on or near the ground The horse could step on the rope trip on it or get tangled up on it and potentially suffer serious injury You can tie a horse to something higher than his head Leave about 2 to 3 feet 06 to 09Â m of rope between the horse and the object it is tied to This is enough rope to allow the horse to comfortably move his head Leaving more rope can lead to injury If your horse will be tied up for a number of hours be sure that there is food and water available and that the horse is sheltered from the elements Tying your horse to a sturdy fence post under the shade of a tree might be an option or to a sturdy post or gate inside a barnCheck on the horse frequently especially if it is new to being tied up   It is always a good idea to carry a knife in case the horse manages to pull the knot tight and you need to release it in a hurry Cut through the rope between the post or ring and the knot Be sure to hold the knife so the blade is facing away from both you and your horse so that no one is injured if the rope abruptly gives way Never step over or under a tie rope and remain well out of kicking range when walking behind the horse Speak to your horse softly before approaching it to avoid startling it and keep your hands on the horse as you walk alongside it Untie the horse and turn the horse to where you want it to go before you remove the halter Quickrelease knots should be very easy to untie For the bowline simply untie the knot using both hands

If you ever touch her does she touch you back or does she avoid contact When you talk does she lean towards you Does she open her shoulders up to your when youâre talking or does she keep her distance and remained reserved These arenât foolproof ways of knowing that she does or does not like you but they can help you get an idea Some girls might be more comfortable messing around with and touching guys even if they donât like them  If she avoids or finds excuses to get out of time that you would otherwise share together she probably doesnât like you If she was thinking about how she liked you she would probably be making excuses to be around you more not the other way around Donât take this as gospel â there is always the chance that she is really shy However if you find that sheâs constantly scheduling her doctors appointments during the free period you have together that probably isnât a good sign  She might not be interested in you if she flirts with other guys but she might be trying to make you jealous so donât immediately assume the worst Thereâs also no way to know if sheâs really flirting with the guy or just being friendly   It is a good idea to see how much attention she pays to other guys versus how much attention she pays to you Again if sheâs really shy she may be more comfortable talking to guys that she doesnât like versus someone she does â maybe you   Girls often tell their friends who they like If her friends ever laugh at you or her they might think its funny that she likes you They might act immaturely and tease you and her   Not all friends do this but if you pay attention you might catch a friend winking at your crush or giving them an elbow nudge Keep your eye out for these types of clues   Sometimes when you like someone all you want to do is stare at him or her If you catch her looking over at you often she might like you If she never even looks your way she may be trying to hide the fact that she likes you Or she could just be focused on her work If you often make eye contact across the room that is a very very good sign  When the two of you talk she will probably make lots of eye contact if she is interested in you She probably will smile often and pay attention to what you are saying too
If your guy is stressed out over work or school dealing with family issues or preoccupied with a personal crisis he probably wonât be all that receptive to a big new development in your relationship There is no perfect moment so dont wait for one A lowkey quiet moment without stress is always a good opportunity There are however bad times to talk about love   After sex While intoxicated Over text or the phone During or after a fight or argument  Is there a special place that brings up strong memories for the both of you You may want to tell him at the place where you had your first date or where you went out to dinner for your twomonth or sixmonth anniversary That said all that really matters is that you have a place to talk without being interrupted constantly   Ask him to go for a walk with you help with a basic chore or simply come over to talk with me for a few minutes   Dont try a big gesture or romantic setting  this isnt the time and chances are good it will backfire What matters are you and your feelings So dont overthink things Speak from the heart and have an open conversation not some big production   Just start talking honestly about your relationship  how happy he makes you good memories youve shared your own feelings  to bring up the topic of love organically Eventually the only thing left to do is just come out and say it So close your eyes count to three and let it out Say it any way you feel comfortable since the words themselves are what really matter Make eye contact smile bravely and be the astounding honest and loving person you already are Remember simpler is sweeter If youre shy and unsure what to do try out these methods   Im in love with you Joe I want you to know that these past eight months have been some of the happiest of my life I feel like weâve connected on a deep level and every day we spend together is better than the last I love you Ive had something on my chest for a while and it feels good to let it out I love you Lean in and kiss him on the cheek then whisper in his ear quickly I love you   If you cant meet in person but still need to get your feelings off of your chest there is nothing decreeing that you cant say I love you anyway The reason facetoface is nicer is that it is much more personal  but you can make longdistance conversations personal Instead of a text message or signing off with an ambiguous I love you take the time to write a letter or email that has the only purpose of expressing your love It doesnt have to be long just from the heart   Let them know that youd rather talk to them in person but couldnt keep your feelings secret any longer Elaborate a bit on a story event or emotion that lead you to your feelings of love Let him know that you dont need an immediate response you just wanted to let him know how you felt

If you both share the same friends it might be less stressful if you ask one of them to introduce you to the girl you want to approach In this case you can approach the girl with your friend and she will most likely already be open to meet you   Ask your friend Do you mind introducing me to Morgan I want to be her friend When your friend introduces you to the girl some good things to say are Are you having fun here Whats your favorite thing about this place or What school do you go to   Girls look for confidence in people and its important that you dont take too long to approach herThe longer you take the more awkward it will feel when you finally decide to approach   If she doesnt like you you werent meant to be friends in the first place but there isnt anything wrong with you Practice makes perfect The first time you approach a girl it might not go well but youll learn from every experience and become better at it over time   Stay respectful at all times Dont make negative comments about her appearance or make fun of her Even though your friends may laugh it can ruin your relationship with a girl   Stay away from sexual jokes or things that are disgusting You can tease a girl a little bit but dont go too far and hurt her feelings If shes not smiling or laughing you know youve gone too far   If it looks like shes having fun with her friends then you may want to wait till after shes done Some girls in fifth grade are concerned with social status and will probably want to make sure that youre cool enough to her friends She may be pressured by her friends to ignore you

Is she your friend or are you total strangers If its the latter try to strike up a conversation The best way to start a conversation is to find common interests If this girl is emo then you can almost guarantee that her interests will be music related like listening to writing or composing lyrics maybe even art related passtimes   Its even better if she has band merchandises on or has lyrics written over her stuffs Find out what bands she likes and talk to her about them Ask about her favorite bands or those bands members how they look act or sound and what she thinks on the topics  You might be able to suggest them to her These can include anything from hardcore posthardcore metal metalcore heavy metal emo punk rock pop rock or even alternative   Dont pretend to know things just because shes interested in them   Be yourself and talk as yourself but remain quiet and try to be personal   Dont make inappropriate gestures or try ridiculous schemes to gain her attention Dont try to impress her with skills you do or dont posses but instead try to be a friendly warm person who she can relate to   That means talking with her and also becoming friends with her friends and trying to be accepted into their friendship group Try to talk to her about everything not just music or school Show her that her opinion matters and that you understand where she is coming fromHowever if she tells you to stop talking to her respect her wishes     Go to a concert of a band you both like It is a great experience that you can treasure but may be slightly expensive Local Shows Seeing a small band in your town is an even better idea because you can be close whilst still being around others This experience is much more special and you can find other likeminded people at these events while helping home grown talent Going To A Small CD Store Not many of these exist anymore so if you do have one near you utilize it They are great places to get music advice from other people whilst being in a beautifully quaint location that is probably relatively unknown     Go To a Park Sometimes you dont want to go too far away and a local park is just what you want Set up a cute picnic or watch a local team play You can go for a walk Bring down a ball to kick around or even better an instrument and play her a song Stay Home And sometimes you dont want to leave the house Try watching a scary movie or a horrible one Cook Try new recipes Explore your tastes together Craft Artisan crafts make great bonding experiences     Try to get her something she has wanted for a long time Be careful with clothes though Ask a friend of hers to go shopping with you so you can get her size Or try to buy something else like a necklace or a hat
Outside create an enclosure or fenced in area for them to play in You can use a wire fence or cage as long as it doesnt leave gaps that your guinea pigs can escape through Guinea pigs can stand too much heat so make sure you keep them cool when they go outside For one you should always provide them with shade so they can cool down In addition only let them out during cooler times of the day in the summerGuinea pigs prefer temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit While they can stand a bit more variation you dont want to go too much colder or warmer Damp grass can give your pig a chill and thats not good for them Also make sure you arent setting them down on grass that has been sprayed with insecticides or other chemicals as that can be damaging for your guinea pig Once again you want to be sure to always provide your guinea pig with food and water Water is especially important when your guinea pig is outside because it can easily get dehydrated when it is warm out Guinea pigs love to chew on any plant in their vicinity which is fine when theyre munching on grass However some plants are poisonous to guinea pigs so you want to make sure they dont have access to thoseUse a database like Cornells httppoisonousplantsanscicornelleduindexhtml to look up poisonous plants in your area Many common plants like daisies and buttercups are poisonous to guinea pigs If you keep your guinea pigs just on grass without weeds you should be fine   You do not want to leave your guinea pig unattended outside For one if your enclosure doesnt have a roof your guinea pig could easily be carried off by a predator It could even happen if your enclosure does have a roofIn addition you want to make sure your guinea pigs dont wriggle out and escape Also because guinea pigs are susceptible to heat stroke you want to keep an eye on them while outside Signs of heatstroke include lethargy a limp body trouble breathing a rapid pulse and a wet chin Your guinea pig may also feel hot to the touch Check the ears to see if they feel extra warm If you notice signs of heatstroke bring the guinea pig indoors Use tepid water not cold because it can cause shock to dab around the ears and feet You can even dip its feet in water Once the guinea pig seems cooler take it to the vet
Before you put a litter box in your guinea pigs cage you need to watch her to see where she normally goes to the bathroom Guinea pigs like to scent mark their territory so your guinea pig will likely scope out a corner of her cage to pee and poop in regularly   Although there is one corner where she will go most often this does not mean she will always go in this corner Just pick the place she frequents the most  Once you have figured out the best location for your guinea pigs litter box you need to buy a tray that will fit nicely in that corner Pick one that is the right size for the cage as well as one that will be comfortable for your guinea pig You dont want it to be too small because then she wont have enough room to sit and go to the potty   You can buy small litter trays at your local pet store that are for small rodents You also need to put in brand new bedding Otherwise she will smell her old pee and might want to go there The litter tray needs to be filled with the same kind of bedding that you keep in your guinea pig cage Although it is called a litter tray the substance used for the tray is not what is typically considered litter but is actually just the same hay or straw that you keep in your guinea pig cage You should take a handful or two from the cage where she has already pooped and peed and lay that in the litter tray at first Then you should set the try in the cage that you picked earlier   Using hay at first that has already been soiled will lead her to the tray because her scent will be all over it The kinds of bedding that work great for guinea pigs are aspen wood pulp hay and straw There are also different varieties of litter pellets and bedding that have been vet recommended as well Never buy cedar or corn cob for your guinea pig because they are toxic Dont put her food and water near or in the litter box She will not like to potty where she eatsYou can also put a little bit of eating straw in her litter tray as well so she will feel comfortable in there and might be able to munch a little while she goes to the bathroom Once you place the try in her cage watch to see if she uses it Since it smells like her and is in a familiar location she should use it most of the time If you find that she doesnt use it you might have to take it out and try again There might be something wrong with the tray that is deterring her from using itWhen you see her using her litter box give her a treat This will encourage her behavior and make her want to use it more so you will give her more treatsIf the sides on the litter tray look too big for her you should use sharp scissors or a small saw or knife and cut the excess edge off This will make it short enough for her to get into the tray   You should only clean out the litter tray every three days or so You can dump out what is in the litter tray and replenish it with new litter You should only wash the tray every other week This will make sure that her smell will remain on the tray and she will likely go back to itYou should use litter that is best for guinea pigs If you arent sure what to use ask at your local pet store or vets office   Although most guinea pigs will learn to use a litter tray most or all of the time there are some guinea pigs that might never learn to use it Keep trying to get your guinea pig to use the tray but even if she only uses it half the time that is that much less you have to clean up out of her cageNever punish your guinea pig or yell at her She doesnt understand why she needs to go to the potty in the same place all the time Encourage the good behavior but dont try punishment It doesnt work on guinea pigs Once you have trained your guinea pig in her cage you may want to train your guinea pig outside of her cage during play time Start somewhere small It needs to be an area that you can control easily and where you can keep an eye on her You should make sure there arent any small vents that she can run into without getting out   A bathroom or hallway is a great place to start They are small have few wires that are close to the ground and have very few places for your guinea pig to hide This will help keep her safe and help you keep track of her while still allowing her to exercise You need to pick a dark out of the way corner of the room to place her litter tray This will encourage her to seek that corner out and use it to potty Since this will be the only thing that has her smell on it she will be able to find it not matter which corner you put it in   Try to leave some litter in it that has already been used This way it will feel like her territory If you want you can let her loose for a little while first to see which corner she prefers to go to the potty and then place her litter tray there Guinea pigs like to use the potty in dark corners away from other things just like they do in their cages To help persuade your guinea pig to use the corner where you placed her tray you need cover up the remaining corners so she cannot run there to potty   If she has no other dark corner to pee or poop in she will be more likely to use her litter tray in the other corner If you want to you can also place newspaper around the room in case she has an accident This will make it easier to clean up Once your guinea pig gets used to the area you can expand it a little at a time Since she should already know where her litter tray is she should use it even though her play area is bigger Just make sure you keep wires off the floor and hard to reach hiding spaces covered so you dont injure or lose your guinea pig   Just like with training in the cage do not scold her if she uses the bathroom somewhere else You can reward her when she goes in her litter tray which will be a positive reminder to use the area

Be confident keep your head up and look her into her eyes If you are confident you can make the first move  Typically people love to talk about themselves Ask her questions and get to know her If she doesnt know you or doesnt seem interested in sharing back off You dont want to come off as creepy   May I sit If she doesnt reply quickly it means that she wants you to stick around longer because she likes you If she likes you shell want to talk to you more than any other personunless shes playing hard to get Also if she smiles while shes talking or says not yes not no answers that means she is nervous of how you will judge her   If she likes you especially if you dont talk with her too much she will attempt to talk to you and start very small conversations If she has a question take note if she goes out of her way to ask you instead of anyone else   Call out her name and say Hi She will probably just smile because she is nervous   When she talks to you does she say your name a lot If so it means that she wants you to notice that she likes you   Blurt it at her and keep doing so until she notices Chances are if she has even a trace amount of feelings for you shell smile and try to stretch the conversation If she just gives you a dirty look and turns away its okay just go to the next step   Make sure that you do not make her think you dislike her at all Be polite and gentlemanlike   Dont worry if her friends dont act different around you she may not have told them   Or if you sit across from her she will be angled in towards you This means she likes you and wants to get closer to you   Get it out of the way If she likes you it will save a lot of running around after her   Im always thinking of her and if she asks you Who do you like tell her that its her or you can say that her name starts with a the letter her name starts with and get her to think a little before you tell her This is a really good flirting method but only do this to a point because most girls like guys to come straight out with it   If she logs off then that is a big hint that she likes you   If she is playing with her bangs tugging on her hair playing with her hair or adjusting her clothes when she is talking to you she probably likes you Girls seem to get nervous around the guy they like If she cant look you in the eye it may be a sign of something good She could really like you and want to look good for you or shes very nervous around you   This is a definite sign   When youre talking to her beforehand have your friend walk up and say Hi If she says Hi and turns back to you she either wants your attention or wants him to leave so she can continue   If she has a hard time thinking of a comeback she probably likes you but doesnt want to go any further so that she doesnt offend you   Girls can get jealous   If she likes you shell walk faster to catch up with you On the other hand if shes walking in front of you and shes walking really slowly its because she wants you to speed up and walk next to her If she slows down behind you dont take this as a sign she doesnt like you Shes probably just nervous   If she tries to act funny around you then there might definitely be something there   See if she follows in your direction If she does dont do this very many times Otherwise she may notice what you are doing   If she does the same back she probably likes you   It means that she is watching the chat list and waiting for you to come online However if she doesnt do this every time dont worry she is probably worried about bugging you or appearing pushy   She may become a better person or start copying some things that you do as an attempt to impress you This is also a good way of finding out roughly how long she has liked you   Take up those problems and try to help her solve them Similarly if you go to her for your problems and she shows an obsessive motherhen concern and genuinely tries to fix every problem she either likes you or you are very good friends   This may or may not mean that she likes you   If you sit near her but not very near to her in a free session talk a tiny bit louder than usual She may appear to be reading a book but if she is not turning the pages and if her head is turned slightly towards you she may be trying to listen to what you are saying Say something funny and if she smiles slightly or chuckles it is almost 100 percent sure that she is listening to you and therefore likes you or at least is interested in you Similarly if she has a textbook open and is writing but she doesnt seem to be aware of what she is writing she may be listening to you this is quite difficult to spot   She may be trying to sneak peeks at you   Or if one of your friends are also friends with her and you walk by to talk to himher she might look at you and smile or she will look at himher with an angry look   Does she touch or play with your hair If youre sitting next to her is her knee touching yours Does she smile at you a lot Does she laugh all the time Do you catch her looking at you These are some pretty obvious flirts   If a girl has liked you for a long time she may not do these things anymore She will probably still look at you from time but they will be more discreet They will become better at concealing their feelings and liking you will be an accepted part of their lives So if she does not openly declare her love for you that does NOT mean that she is not interested Dig deeper   Also if you know her favorite animal then say something about it and then smile at her   because you will freak her out   If she says I really want to see that movie say Hey Me too maybe we can go see it Sometimes this will work only do it if youve known her for a while and she is comfortable with you   That is a clue Also if she always talks about you with her friends shes probably crushing on you If you really want to know you should just ask her or her friends If youre afraid ask one of your friends to ask her friends   If they say that she likes you then ask her out
When a girl likes you she will face in your direction If a girl has her torso turned towards you in an open manner this means that she is confident talking with you If she has a closed body position namely crossed arms or legs she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterestedWhen she is sitting with her legs crossed watch her feet If they are pointed towards you it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you  If a girl likes you she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers Either of these responses could mean that she likes you If she pulls away quickly it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet but she may still like you   When a girl likes you her pupils might dilate though this will be hard to tellIf you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you this could mean that she likes you   The way you interpret a girls body language will vary depending on the context For example if youre talking oneonone with a girl her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting However if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you she may really just be trying to help not flirt   If you are having an intense conversation a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact This does not necessarily mean she likes you It could just be a conversational practice of hers However if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her she may be intrigued by you   When a girl likes you she will often try to touch you as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are She may touch your arm when you say something funny âaccidentallyâ brush your shoulder or hands with hers or gently place her hand on your knee   Not all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch In this case dont assume that she doesnt like you just because she doesnt try to touch you She may be too nervous to do so If you like her dont be shyââbreak the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds She may also find other reasons to touch you such as softly punching your arm These oneofthemates moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers   This is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you Hugs are a friendly affectionate way of getting closer to you and touching you without it necessarily compromising her stealthy flirting skills Return the hug if you like her back or gently refuse her hug if you donât want her to get the wrong impression   If a girl imitates you  for example if you run your fingers through your hair and you notice her do the same a few seconds later  she may be subconsciously mirroring your movements This can be a tell that she likes you Gently twirling strands of her hair or partaking in other grooming behaviors like running her hands through her hair could be signs of flirting   When a girl likes you she will touch her lips collarbone or neck to draw your attention to these areas She may even apply lipstick in front of you This may be her way of signaling to you that sheâs comfortable and happy in your presence When a girl likes you she may also laugh at your jokes regardless of how funny they actually are
Ensure that there is nothing to pose a danger to your guinea pig or you and that there is nothing that your guinea pig can crawl under save for a hidey house for them to retreat to if they feel the need   Training inside the cage works just as well in the beginning if your guinea pig is more comfortable in their cage It will become harder to train inside the cage however as you move on to more advanced tricks that require equipment such as climbing over things Keep in mind that anything you do use for a trick such as a hoop must be adjusted to fit the needs of your piggy Remember that not all guinea pigs have the ability to focus on one task for more than a few minutes at a time so changing up the training routine may help a guinea pig to learn more easily and not become bored   Make sure that you are not holding it impossibly high as the idea is to make your guinea pig stand up on its hind legs to receive the treat Dont keep it too low either or your pig may stand up snatch the treat and get away with it without learning anything This could happen with any trick   Praise your guinea pig as if they just did the hardest thing in the world and then repeat   Try to time the click or word so that the moment they drop back down you perform the action This will eventually lead to the mindset of your piggy being like this TrickClickMarkerTreatPraise It may take time for the guinea pig to realize this but when they do training is much easier When your guinea pig does this trick make sure they do not stand up for too long and allow them to lean on your hand for support if needed   The guinea pig may stand up on its hind legs without you giving them the motion which is goodit shows that the guinea pig understands what it has to do to get the treat However it is important for them to wait for you to give the signal If they stand up just watch quietly and when they finish put the treat or finger over their head again This part may take a while and it may cause some confusion but it is essential for your guinea pig to learn to wait for your command and when they do its very rewarding

The easiest way to tell the queen bee apart from other bees is by her size Queens mated with drones are the largest bees in the hive both longer and wider than other bees while queens who have yet to mate or virgin queens are smaller than mated queens but larger than either worker bees or drones   The queen bees larger size as well as her ability to lay eggs is due to eating proteinrich royal jelly which is secreted from glands on the heads of young worker bees and mixed with pollen to form a whitish milk or mush All bees are fed royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen bees are fed royal jelly until reaching physical maturity Royal jelly not only enables queen bees to mature sexually it also enables them to reach physical maturity sooner after 16 days as opposed to 21 days for worker bees and contributes to their extended lifespan Virgin queens are reared in the event the mated queen becomes old or incapacitated They are kept separate from the mated queen and each other if 1 virgin queen encounters another she will attack and attempt to kill it  A queen bees larger abdomen is noticeably more pointed than the abdomens of either worker or drone bees   Worker bees stingers are barbed once they sting a target the barb catches and pulls the stinger from their abdomen killing the worker Queen bees however have no barbs on their stingers enabling them to sting a target repeatedly   Necessary because of her greater size keeping her legs splayed apart like those of the bug in the game of Cootie enables the queen bee to move quickly through the hive   As long as the queen bee is healthy and productive worker bees are notably deferential to her getting out of her way when she moves forward and standing at attention facing her when she stops

Consider the possibility that a romantic relationship between you and the sister could have repercussions on your relationship with your friendFamily loyalty runs deep and you may find yourself running into problems with both siblings   If you and the sister break up your friend may take her side and be angry with you The sister may not want to pursue a relationship with you if she sees how upsetting it is to her sibling   Observe her behavior and determine if you think she might like you Because of the potential of damaging your friendship you might not want to pursue her unless you know you have a good chance of being successful   For example maybe she is talking to you a lot making eye contact and smiling Those could be signs she is interested in you If the only thing you know about her is that sheâs cute and is related to your friend spend some time learning more about her Her personality may make her more or less attractive to youTalk to her while at your friendâs house Ask her about her interests and favorite things Find out what you have in common besides your friend For example you could ask âAre you going out for the swim team again next year Which events did you do this yearâ or âI heard you have Mr Winters for geometry How are you doing in that class It was impossible for meâ Try to get to know her without your friend present but do not try to ditch your friend to do this Wait until your friend leaves the room for example You may find out that while you enjoy hanging out with the sister in your friendâs presence you may find that the dynamic changes when you and the sister are alone For example you may enjoy the way your friend and their sister tease each other in your presence but you and the sister do not have that same component to your relationship   If your friend is okay with it and if the sister seems interested you may decide to ask the sister out Find a moment when the two of you can be alone without your friend present and let her know how you feel   Acknowledge that the situation is strange The sister might be uncomfortable with the idea at first She might feel loyalty to her sibling and not want to hurt their feelings Give her some time to think about it You could say âI know itâs weird because Iâm Brianâs friend But weâve been hanging out so much together this summer and Iâve gotten to know you better and enjoy your company So I was wondering if you wanted to go out sometimeâ Let her know that you have talked to her sibling about it You could say âI told Tina how I feel and she is okay with me asking you out We talked about it for a long time I didnât want to cause any problems in your familyâ If she doesnât seem interested let it go and move on It is not worth pursuing her to risk your relationship with your friend   See how it is hanging out with just the sister See if you have any romantic connection or if she is just someone you care about as a friend or âlike a sisterâ   If she seems to like you too take things very slowly Do not rush the relationship You do not want to move too fast and cause hurt feelings that could damage your relationship with your friend If it doesnât seem like you have a connection beyond just a friendship stop dating her Donât force the relationship to happen It could complicate your relationship with your friend and their family For example you could say âI really like you but I think we are better as friends I donât want to hurt your feelings but I also donât want to end up hurting your familyâs feelings too I really like your sibling and think that trying to make this work will just create bad blood between all of usâ   Understand that a relationship with their sister changes the dynamics of your friendshipYour friend might be jealous that you are spending more time with their sister than with them   Balance your time between the sister and your friend You may want to be spending all your time with the sister but keep in mind that you were friends with her sibling first Make a special effort to do things with just your friend Invite your friend over to your house without the sister present to do something that you both enjoy Keep your relationship with your friendâs sister separate Do not invite your friend out with you and the sister for example

The most straightforward way to get a guy talking is to walk right up to him and introduce yourself It doesnt matter if hes the new guy at work the cute boy youve noticed around the school corridors or the handsome stranger at the coffee shop  put your shoulders back plant a smile on your face and approach him confidently Say hi tell him your name and ask for his  if youre lucky hell take it from there   Once you find out the guys name use it frequently in the conversation People like to hear their own name  it makes the conversation more personal and creates a sense of intimacy between you Say something like Hi Ive noticed you around here and I just thought Id come over and introduce myself My names Kate whats yours Simple  One of the easiest ways to start a conversation is to take advantage of your surrounding circumstances to get him talking It could be literally anything from the weather to the traffic to the results of a sports game You can either make the comment to him directly or to yourself hoping he sees it as an opportunity and responds   Commenting on the weather may seem like a mundane conversation starter but it works nevertheless Try saying something like Beautiful day huh Dont you just love the sunshine When starting a conversation with someone you dont know the point is to break the ice and open a line of communication first Once youve done that you can move on to more interesting topics If youre sitting next to a cute guy on the train or an airplane try sighing and muttering to yourself about the delay or bumpiness of the ride If hes interested hell take this as his cue to respond in sympathetic agreement Once you have his attention you can take it from there   Men love to help women Theyre biologically wired that way So engaging the damsel in distress routine from time to time might just help to get the conversation going Appeal to his manly muscle and strength  it will give him a confidence boost and make him feel more comfortable around you allowing conversation to flow more freely   If youre struggling with a heavy stack of files or a bulky box ask if he can help to lighten the load If you just cant seem to open the coffee jar or unscrew the cap of your water bottle see if hell oblige Make sure to smile and thank him sweetly after he helps you  everyone likes a little appreciation when they do a good deed And hell be ready to jump at the opportunity to help next time round This step also comes with a warning dont overdo it You want a guys respect as well as his attention so dont play the damsel in distress too often or youll come across as helpless   Guys like compliments just as much as girls do so paying your guy an enthusiastic genuine compliment will definitely get you in the good books and optimize his interest in the conversation Paying him a compliment is a great conversation starter as you can be as intimate or as casual as you like depending on how confident youre feeling   If youre feeling forward compliment him on his amazing eyes his killer sixpack or his George Clooney smile This will let him know that you find him physically attractive which all guys love to hear If youre aiming to be a little less obvious compliment him on his snappy suit his funky band tee or his greatsmelling cologne  letting him know that you think he has great taste  Compliment him on his performance at work or on the sports field if you happen to be present at the time Tell him he did a great job on the presentation or that he played really well Hell know that you were paying particular attention to him Alternatively you can compliment him on something a little less personal If you run into him walking his dog compliment the dog instead earning you major guy points Or tell him that you approve of his choice of sandwich at lunch Anything that grabs your attention and gets him talking   Questions are great conversation starters especially if youre feeling a little awkward as they provide you with an excuse to talk to the guy under the pretense of seeking out information The questions themselves can be as short and simple as you like Just try to avoid questions that can be answered with a short yes or no as this can lead to awkwardness causing the conversation to fizzle away   Phrase questions in such a way that he will be forced to think about the answer or at least provide more than a monosyllabic response Men can be a little dull at times so try to help them along a little Hell soon realize that youre more interested in him than in finding out what time it is Try asking him if he has a pen you could borrow or if he watched the basketball game last night At this point its just about grabbing his attention and getting the conversation going so dont worry too much about the topic   Finding a shared interest is conversational gold When you find a topic that both of you enjoy talking about the conversation will flow much more easily Even if its something youre not particularly knowledgeable about demonstrate your interest by asking him plenty of questions and allow him to do the talking   For example if you discover that you both like to watch football ask him about his favorite team who he thinks their best players are and whether theyll make it to the playoffs this year Once you get him going therell be no stopping him and hell probably think youre a pretty cool girl for being interested Pick up on hints about his interests from his clothing desk or accessories If hes wearing a band tee  bingo He likes music If he has a surfing picture set as his desktop background thats a pretty good indication he likes to ride the waves Picking up on small details can help you to choose the right topic to get him going   To really get the conversation going and to find out about your guys interests and personality its important to ask openended questions Avoid questions with oneword answers or rote questions that hell automatically answer without thinking   For example avoid starting a conversation with how are you which hell probably answer by reflex with a fine or a good Instead try asking him what did you do this weekend or what do you think of the new boss which will force him to think about his answer and actually string a sentence together Alternatively you can try asking him an eitheror question to initiate a playful debate Ask him whether he prefers The Simpsons or Family Guy rock or hiphop burgers or hot dogs Whatever he answers gently tease him about it and soon youll both be laughing   Conversational etiquette dictates that you should always listen more than you talk Thats why you have two ears and only one mouth right So once youve got the ball rolling take a back seat during the conversation and really listen to what hes got to say Let him take charge of the conversation for a while  in case youve never noticed guys tend to like the sound of their own voice   Even when youre not talking try to stay engaged in the conversation Acknowledge things he says with a smile nod or other appropriate facial expression or gesture  Being a good listener during your conversation does two things it allows you to make a good impression letting the guy know that youre thoughtful and easy to talk to while also giving you the chance to see whether you actually think this guy is worth your time From the things the guy says youll get a pretty good idea of his personality and you can think about whether you want to take the next step This is important because  lets face it  if you dont find him interesting now you wont find him any more interesting on a date   On the other hand if youve got nothing to say for yourself he may not find you very interesting Elevate your conversation beyond everyday chitchat by posing an interesting or thoughtprovoking question that will make him think and ensure that you make an impression Give him something to ponder and youll be in his head long after the conversation has ended   For example ask him fun yet interesting questions like If you could visit anywhere in the world where would it be or If your house were on fire what three things would you save or If you were a fictional character who would you be These questions will hopefully make him smile and give you a little insight into his personality Or you can get a little more serious and personal and ask him questions like what is your biggest regret in life or where do you see yourself in ten years Just to be clear these are not the kind of questions that you ask to open a conversation or that you bring up completely out of the blue If you do hell probably think youre just a teeny bit crazy These questions are best reserved for when the initial awkwardness has passed maybe after a couple of drinks   Pop culture is the old reliable when it comes to conversational material Everyone no matter what their interests will have something to say about movies music television shows books or the latest crazy celebrity baby names Once youve gotten a sense of what his interests are you can ask him whether hes seen a particular movie read a particular book or heard a popular bands new record   Also try asking for the guys opinion or recommendation when it comes to an aspect of pop culture he considers himself an expert on Guys love to show off their vast knowledge especially to a rapt audience For example if he loves Woody Allen movies but youve never seen any ask him which is the best one to start with Feeling confident Maybe you could suggest watching it together Or if you can find something random that youre just as knowledgeable about as he is youre in luck Impress him with your love of obscure 70s punkrock bands or your readership of FrancoBelgian comic books He might just think youre The One   The final step in successfully conversing with a guy is to know when to gracefully bow out You should always leave him wanting more not wishing youd take the hint and leave After a particularly successful joke or story you should try to make your exit Tell him that you need to get back to work or should be getting home Hopefully hell be disappointed youre leaving and will look forward to the next time you get a chance to talk   If you feel that things really went well and you like this guy even more now put yourself out there and suggest that the two of you go out for coffee or drinks after work sometime If you feel too awkward to say it out loud do like the girls in the movies and slip him your number on a scrap of paper Right before you leave you should look the guy straight in the eyes flash him a smile and say I really enjoyed talking to you insert guys name here Its personal its flirtatious and its so much more memorable than see you later   Guys are more attracted to happy laughing smiling girls than scowling duckfaced divas Fact Smiling makes you seem friendly and approachable before you even open your mouth to speak Hell instantly feel more comfortable around you and be more willing to open up Laughing at his jokes will boost his ego and make him feel good while also making you look more attractive Winwin   Eye contact is one of the most vital aspects of successful conversations Think about it If you are constantly averting your eyes or looking away youll either look awkward and uncomfortable or as if youre not interested in being there at all Plenty of eye contact projects confidence and indicates interests which is exactly what youre trying to achieve Be careful not to stare though thats just plain creepy   Ok so you want this guy to know youre interested but you dont need to wave it in front of his face You can smile at him make eye contact laugh at his jokes and ask him questions but dont do it too often or hang on his every word like an overeager puppy Try to retain a little bit of mystery and make him work a little for your attention Guys like the chase remember   Attraction isnt always physical nor should it be You want a guy whos attracted to your intelligence your sparkling wit your sweet nature and maybe your ability to chug a pint of beer in under 7 seconds But when trying to get a guys attention it doesnt hurt to look your best This doesnt mean high heels and a full face of makeup Rather it involves things such as dressing to suit your figure always having freshlywashed sweetsmelling hair or wearing makeup that draws attention to your best features such as your full lips or beautiful eyes   Asking questions and getting to know this guy better is all perfectly fine but try not to scare him off either Dont ask him questions that you wouldnt feel comfortable answering yourself Also try to keep the questions breezy  you dont want him to feel like youre scrutinizing his answers as if he were interviewing for a job or being crossexamined on the witness stand Play nice   A subtle brush against his shoulder or a hand lightly placed on his arm midconversation can give a guy chills and let him know without having to say a word that youre interested You shouldnt overdo it but once or twice over the course of a conversation will achieve just the desired effect   This is what its all been leading up to right If youve spoken to your guy decided you like him and youre pretty sure he likes you back why not bite the bullet and ask him out It doesnt need to be a big romantic gesture or anything so formal as dinner Try asking him if hed like to a grab a coffee or something stronger after work on Friday This will give you a chance to spend some more time together without being in an overtly datelike situation Just think of it as an extra opportunity to work on your conversation skills Not so scary at all
When you see your crush just go right up and start a conversationShow them how confident you are by going straight for it instead of shying awayDonât give yourself time to overthink things and grow anxious or give someone else the chance to swoop in and steal their attention Just walk on up and open with something casual TryAsking a question about something you share in common like a class âHey do you know which pages Mr Kingsley asked us to read for tomorrow I didnât write them down and now I canât rememberâ Commenting on something that peaks your interest like their new sneakers âHey nice kicks Whereâd you get themâ Using something incidental to get the ball rolling like the book theyâre reading âYou know that oneâs been in my toread pile forever Is it worth getting intoâ   Once you draw them into a conversation keep the spotlight on them at first to draw them in farther Think of yourself as an interviewer and ask a lot of followup questions This will flatter their ego by showing that youâre interested in what they think and give you a chance to grow more comfortable with them before the spotlight turns on you For example if you opened the conversation by commenting on the book theyâre readingAsk if theyâve read any of that authorâs books If they have which would they recommend reading first Say the book they recommend was turned into a movie Ask which they liked better and why As you go on let the conversation flow naturally from topic to topic but keep the focus on what they think of that topic whatever it may be So if they really liked the movie adaptation because their favorite director made it ask why they like that director which film is their favorite and so on   Make direct eyecontact when you walk up to them and maintain it as you talk Show them that youâre interested in what they have to say by keeping your attention on them Avoid glancing away and staring off at something else which might make them think youâre bored distracted or feeling defensiveThat isnât to say that you should stare at them without blinking though because that could be creepy Take natural breaks Shut your eyes or look away when you laugh If someone else shouts or zips by on a bike a few feet away glance at them Just keep your breaks brief and bring your attention back to your crush immediately Donât forget to smile when you first approach Show them that youâre happy to be talking to them and that they should be happy too   Focus on whatâs happening outside of you instead of your internal emotions Tune all of your attention to what your crush says and does Empty your mind of everything else so you only react to the conversation not any anxiety that you might be feeling insideOf course donât take that too literally and stand there emptyheaded like a zombie The trick is to quiet any thoughts that donât have anything to do with what the two of you are talking about right here right now This way you wonât overthink things and make the conversation awkward by worrying about stuff that has nothing to do with it   Asking your crush lots of questions at first shows your interest in their thoughts and opinions but remember to start sharing your own as you grow more comfortable around them Donât make them feel like this is a police interrogation Make the conversation an equal giveandtake as you go onLetâs say youâre still talking about their favorite director and movies If one of their favorite movies is one of yours too say so and tell them why you love it If not play the desert island game and ask which five movies theyâd bring with them to watch for the rest of their lives Then share your own picks and the reasons why As you go on and ask them more questions share your own answers after they do For instance if all five of their desert island picks are horror flicks say âYouâre really into horror huhâ Then share your own opinion on the genre By being bold asking lots of questions and sharing your own answers you can make them feel like the conversation is equal parts giveandtake At the same time you get to direct the course of the conversation so you can reveal exactly what you want to share about yourself   Make the conversation enjoyable by sticking to topics that you both enjoy Leave serious talks for the future when the two of you are officially together For now just show your crush that youâre a fun person to talk to and keep the conversation carefreeAvoid being negative Say you absolutely hate their favorite movie Donât put them off by picking it apart That isnât to say you have to lie and say you loved it Be honest but carefree Just say you couldnât get into it and leave it at that Then use some aspect about it as a springboard to something you can speak positively about For example if an actor in that movie was in a movie you do love switch topics by saying something like âOh but you know what Tom Hardy movie I do love   â On the other hand if you both think a movie was terrible feel free to bond over picking it apart if you both enjoy doing that   Dont assume everythings destined to go wrong That will just increase your chances of selffulfilling that destiny and acting like more of an idiot Instead keep an open mind Stop yourself from trying to read too much into every little thing your crush says or does Unless they flatout say I dont like you take it easy on yourself Go with the flow and assume everything will work out for the bestYoure not a mindreader so give yourself a break if they seem withdrawn when you talk with them They could be tired distracted or depressed about something else entirely Focus on what goes right instead of worrying about what goes wrong For example if you made them laugh with a joke cherish that moment instead of dwelling on the fact that you stuttered a few times Keep a sense of humor about yourself Remember everyone acts like an idiot sometimes so dont beat yourself up when you do Showing your crush that you can laugh at yourself will make you seem even more confident

There are many reasons why you might want a relationship with a boy thats older than you Most of the time we see older people as more sophisticated and mature This is most often the case but not always Some older boys will be just as immature as they ever were  Theres no point in dating an older boy because you think it will make you appear cooler Before committing to a relationship you should make sure youre ready for a relationship Especially if youre looking to date someone older than you theres that much less   If two people are at different stages in their lives it can bring up issues in communication For instance if you want to go out and party with your older boyfriend he might be at a part of his life where hes had his fun and prefers a night indoors In some cases it can be hard to have a sense of equality in a relationship when one person has considerably more life experience than the other Keep these potential problems in mind before you commit   On the other hand some maintain that age is just a numberTheres no concrete reason why people of different ages cant connect on a deep meaningful level   Even if your relationship is perfect other people are prone to make nasty assumptions about an age gap relationship Theres only so much you can do to fend off these naysayers Ultimately its your relationship not theirs and you shouldnt put their feelings before your own   If youre under the age of 18 you should consider the legal consequences of someone who is older than you If the age gap is big enough to make a sexual relationship illegal you should not go through with it   In virtually all cases of trying to make someone your boyfriend you should be his friend first before anything romantic happens Go out of your way to spend time with him Ask him to hang out as you normally would with a regular friend If there is chemistry and the two of you are emotionally available theres a good likelihood that things will begin to take shape in time For the meantime however you should simply enjoy the experience of hanging out as friends   Unless the older boy in question is incredibly shy the fact that he has more life experience will probably mean that hell be the one to instigate something Some guys can be made to feel uncomfortable by a girl that is very forward especially someone who is younger than them   If it doesnt look like hes going to make a move out of shyness you should think about making a move yourself This should occur if he has shown signs of interest but hasnt acted on it over the course of a few hangouts   This is where it can difficult for some girls who try to attract older guys While your first instinct may be to be completely submissive towards the boy this will only go to show your age Instead you should take age out of the equation when it comes to talking to him If it makes you feel more comfortable pretend he is the same age as you Relationships usually need a sense of balance between the two people in order to succeed   If youre attracted to a guy you can say a lot simply by making eye contact with him and holding his gaze Flirting covers a wide range of different behaviours but most flirting begins with steady eye contact   This kind of gaze is best combined with a smile That way it will tell the boy that youre looking at him for good as opposed to negative reasons   If you smile at the boy youre interested in youll be projecting positive vibes in his direction If he notices your smile and smiles back at you its a sign he is probably interested in you   Saying something nice about someone can be interpreted as a form of flirting Complimenting a boy based on his looks or other traits you find attractive will let him know youre interested Make sure your compliments are genuine however People are usually able to tell when a compliment is sincere or not   Because the boy you are interested in is older than you its possible he has different ideas of what he wants in a relationship with a girl Although you may feel pressured to give in you should only ever do what feels comfortable with you   Relating emotionally to people older than you can be hard if youre not used to spending time with you This is why its recommended that you try to surround yourself with people that are older than you Make friends with people in the boys age range and get comfortable with hanging out with people with more experience than you This can be hard to do if you dont already have older friends If you have older siblings you might try tagging along with some of their hangouts   If you want to make older friends you wont be able to depend on your classes Extracurricular clubs are a place where people of different ages will get together with a common interest If you work a job there will likely be older coworkers you can befriend as well   Regardless of the age youre trying to attract it will work to your benefit if people are able to see that youre a girl of your word If you make a promise do everything you possibly can to follow through with it Dont flake out on plans you make When you follow through with the things you say everything you say will have a greater sense of weight in the eyes of others This includes any older guys you may fancy   Selfesteem is a major sign of maturity Its natural for young boys and girls to feel a lot of insecurity as they grow up If you want to catch the attention of an older boy you re going to need to match the sort of selfassurance that is common with his age range Challenge any negative thoughts that enter your mind and replace them with positive thoughts about yourself Even if you have to fake it until you make it at first youll eventually start to believe it sincerely   Remember that there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to selfesteem Theres no objectively wrong reason to have confidence in yourself   You might be surprised how much youll find out about yourself if you make a regular habit of keeping a diary Buy any book of lined paper or keep a Word file on your computer where you can add thoughts at the end of each day If you become aware of the things youre thinking and feeling on a daily basis youll get a stronger grasp of the way other people see you   Much like a healthy sense of selfconfidence getting past feeling jealous of other people is an important indicator that someone has matured Most teenage girls tend to be very jealous at that stage in their lives If you want to stand out from others your age youll need to let go of your jealousies towards other people This is easier said than done for many people but it is possible Anytime you are beginning to feel jealous towards someone remind yourself that there is no one who can do you better than you Comparing yourself to anyone else is a waste of time   Even if youre trying to become mature beyond your years your current circle of friends might make it difficult to break free Less mature groups of friends will often fall into spurts of drama or gossip The best thing for you to do is to avoid this stuff entirely It doesnt add anything constructive to your life and you wont be made to look good if youre associated with that crowd   This does not mean abandoning your friends Rather you should spend time with them but take a step back if bickering starts Of course if a friend of yours is hurt and wants to talk it through with you you should do so Being mature can also mean being a reliable friend   Nothing can make people look at your twice than a new hairstyle Getting your hair cut or permed will have a major effect on your appearance You should use this opportunity to spruce up your look and turn some heads If youre trying to appeal to older groups you are going to want to steer away from fashion trends that are reserved for juveniles Aim to make your hair attractive but classy   Its a good idea to pick a hairstyle that suits your face shape Ask your hairdresser if you have any confusion Depending on your age there may be things you wear that might seem juvenile in the eyes of someone older While you should always ultimately find your own sense of fashion impressing an older guy can be easier if you look at the fashion expectations for his age group   If the age gap is big enough dont wear the boys age ranges fashion if it will look weird on somebody your age It helps to take a look at some current fashion outlets This will give you some insight into the latest trends   If youre young girl dont try to compensate for your age by using a lot of makeup Doing so only brings more attention to how young you are In addition it also gets the impression across that you are insecure with the way you look Youll have a much higher chance of getting a guy interested if you stay as true to your real sense as possible Some makeup to highlight your natural features should be more than enough   Its a fact that younger girls arent often as skilled at makeup as they will be once theyre older With that in mind its good to start small and work your way up from there   Whether youre standing up or sitting down make an effort to keep your back straight and your shoulders even If youre not used to having good posture this will feel a bit strange to do at first but it will eventually feel natural if you stick with it   Maturity and confidence are the two major ways you can get across the age gap and posture is a way of expressing both of them

Women are attracted to men with a passion in their lives It is attractive to live outside the cookie cutter routine of eat work sleep and repeat Pick up a hobby and plan to change your hobby into your passion Try your hand at a musical instrument a craft like pottery cooking writing running rockclimbing and more   When you express a sincere passion she will respond positivelyLife is too short not be passionate about something Donât be bashful and try your luck at something There is nothing to lose unless you get into extreme sports   Just relax when youâre talking to a girl Women like it when a guy is direct they are not mind readers Speaking to someone you donât know can produce a lot of anxiety for some You can approach someone without opening yourself up to being evaluated Eventually youll be confident enough to talk to them in a normal conversation Try some of these cues   Ask a small favor like âcan you watch my stuff while I get coffeeâ This creates attraction from the person doing the favor Ask a question Use whatever situationlocation you are in to your advantage Ask a relevant question like âhave you seen this band beforeâ or âyou think Texas could be a countryâ Be whimsical if you are feeling it A great way to prove yourself to a woman is showing her that you not only respect her but all women It is too common for guys to view picking up girls as a macho competition instead of wanting to get to know a woman You can show respect by listening to what she has to say respecting her personal space making sure not to interrupt her and refraining from making statements like âyou wouldnât want to do that itâs a guy thingâNever make fun of a girl when youâre trying to tease them A little bit of joking is okay but avoid anything that could be taken as offensive by someone Generosity also goes a long way No one likes a guy who is too stingy to have a good time The same can be said about someone who refuses to give a dollar from time to time   Be a fun person by acting on spontaneity It is attractive and more interesting to be around someone willing to go on an adventure This can also show her how interesting you can beBeing silly and having fun also shows youâre confident and not afraid of taking risks   Careful not to be a knowitall or overly pretentious Most girls will like a guy who reads from time to time and is interested in the world around him Put down the video game and pick up a book Try getting into the habit of reading the news every morning Youâll have more to add to a conversation when you are on top of current eventsNot every girl cares about this   Making someone laugh is a great thing and it is attractive It is one of the most desirable traits women look for in a man Donât modify your humor to appeal to someone in particular Your natural humor will attract the type of person who youâll be able to relax around   Laughter affects people on a chemical level It increases the level of serotonin in our brains which causes our brains function to work more efficiently This doesnt always have to do with your looks but how you think of yourself Have confidence that youll achieve your goals Change your mentality if you think youre attractive you will be attractive Thinking positively is the first step but then to ââactââ positively will increase your self esteem even more This can be simple like talking to people in a positive manner and focus your energy into acting this way   Have ambitions for your life When you have a serious drive for your life women will take notice Change one of your bad habits Start small like waking up without hitting snooze two or three times or drinking 64 ounces of water a day Start small and progressively work to improve yourself in larger ways Do something youâve been procrastinating There is no time like the present It can even be a small thing like cleaning your room
Even if it is your absolute favorite movie or TV show give it a wide berth for a while If you get to the stage where you feel guilty about not watching it this is when you know your obsession is out of hand Hide their films away at least for a while   If you see this actor in theater stop going to the theater shows until youre over this actor  This can be hard especially if you spent all that time gathering pictures of the actors to use as your wallpaper However its best to delete them as this will stop that connection and you wont see the actors face every time you turn on your phone   You do not have to take them down for good just until you stop obsessing over them that way when you put it back up you can appreciate them as an actor not your future husband   Okay so the advantage of a crush on an actor is that you can find out lots about this person by just a click of a button It might help therefore to read a bad film critic or some bad comments about this actor then use this negativity to get over himher   Or avoid Twitter for a while If you are at the obsessing stage and have tried to make contact with them its now time to stop It is likely the actor will not reply and if they do it will be out of sympathy or a routine message sent from their minders or their book of fan messages   So sure you may have seen their interviews read all about them seen all their tweets watched all their movies but this does not mean you know everything about them The only things you know about them are the public things you do not truly know them What you are doing is fantasizing and filling int the gaps to suit yourself imaging up the ideal person without knowing the reality That is super unhealthy and can cause you to do the same thing to real people you do know if you dont take care   It may sound harsh but the majority of the time they have wiveshusbands families or boyfriendsgirlfriends So no matter what you tell yourself they are not going to up sticks and leave that behind because of a tweet you sent them   For example if you fancied Johnny Depp you need to avoid writing Mrs Depp everywhere   If you are too busy obsessing over an actor it may affect your real life Wondering why you havent got a boyfriendgirlfriend Perhaps its because you are too busy crushing over your actor crush to open your eyes to the real world Maybe nobody can measure up to this fantasy image of a person youve created in your headââif thats the case it really is time to come back down to earth
Before he always seemed ready to hang out and now his reasons for not being able to see you are piling up At first you believed him when he said he had a stomach ache or was too tired to go out but youre starting to wonder if hes really trying to tell you that he doesnt want to spend time with you because hes busy hanging out with some other girl Here are some signs that he may be cheating   If he used to save all of his free time for you but now hes always going out for boys night This is especially suspicious if he doesnt have that many male friends or never showed much of an interest in hanging out with his bros before If hes suddenly working overtime all the time Though hes worked overtime occasionally in the past suddenly things are really busy at work and he seems to always be there instead of hanging out with you Of course many professions have a busy season and he could be working on a more timeconsuming project but its more likely that hes using overtime to mean time with my other girlfriend If hes always too tired to stay out late or hang out and was never tired before this may be a sign that hes using his energy on someone else If you made a routine of having lunch or dinner together often and now hes never in the mood or just doesnt feel well or isnt hungry None of these signs alone means that your boyfriend is cheating on you But if all of these things come up repeatedly then it either means that hes spending a lot of quality time with someone else or that he doesnt want to spend time with you anymore If hes always making excuses for why he doesnt want to hang out with you then you should ask yourself why youre still in the relationship   Even when hes not making excuses your boyfriend could start saying things that make him sound like another person all together If theres suddenly a change in how he talks to you and how he talks in general then he may be thinking of another lady Here are some signs that the things he says may show that hes cheating   If he stops complementing you Did he compliment you all the time before and now he suddenly stopped any flattery If he never tells you youre beautiful or mentions your best features and how awesome you generally are then maybe hes saving all of his flattery for someone else If he compliments you more often If he wasnt a big complimenter but suddenly hes always telling you how amazing you are he may be doing it out of guilt If he does this after a long and unexplained absence then this is particularly suspicious If he just sounds different If hes saying things hes never said before using words hes never used before or even laughing in a new way then maybe he picked up these words from a special lady If he doesnt return your texts for hours in the middle of a conversation If you were having a long texting exchange and hes suddenly MIA it may mean that his new lady just showed up
Confidence shows a boy youâre fully committed to engaging with him physically Boys can be lazy so showing a certain amount of confidence and effort can go a long way in improving the quality of a kiss You may not realize it but you have a lot to offer that particular boy youâre aiming to kiss no matter how awesome or cute he is   Appreciate all your qualities not only your looks This can range from your vocabulary and social skills to your passions and hobbies If you feel confident on one particular aspect of yourself more than others use that as a starting point and expand  A great way to inspire and maintain confidence is to wear an outfit youâre more than proud of Pick out a top and bottom you think you could wear anywhere whether that be a fancy restaurant or over to a friendâs house   Itâs easy to dress to the point that it appears as if youâre trying too hard Donât dress in your Sunday best or Prom ready but wear an outfit youâre sure will grab his attention Boys rarely dissect what women wear they only know if they like it or not   Style your hair in a way that makes you feel confident Maybe you like to frame your face with bangs Maybe you feel the most confident with straightened hair Pick the one you feel the most confident in   Like clothes guys will rarely nitpick your hair and notice small imperfections Theyâll only know that it looks good or bad so a little effort goes a long way   Rock a luscious lip balm lipgloss or lipstick to make sure he notices how kissable your lips are Pick a color that suits your skin tone and clothing selection Maybe a deep full red helps brighten your eyes or a light pink really suits the top youâve picked out Again make a selection youre confident in   These cosmetics will also help smooth â or at least bring attention to â any sort of chapped portions of your lips The last thing you want to do is be ready to go in for the kiss and notice how rough and cracked they are   Freshen up your perfume and breath before you intend to meet your potential kissing mate Smelling nice â both in and out of your mouth â goes a long way in creating an inviting welcoming persona One of the most memorable features in people is their specific aroma â make sure yours is a good oneThereâs a chance your boy will not take this into consideration when it comes to breath Itâs always helpful to pack some gum or mints before meeting up with your new kissing mate If needed you can have one and even offer one to the boy you intend on kissing   Nothing says youâre interested like a little flirtation If youâre confident interesting look the part and have created a welcoming moment flirting can even open the possibility of your boy going for the kiss himself   Smile Nothing creates a friendly persona like a smile A smile indicates youâre happy and interested to be talking Boys need all the positive reinforcement they can get so a smile can go a long way A smile will also subtly draw his attention to your mouth something heâll hopefully become intimate with Make light contact Subtly touching your boy will drop an even larger hint that youâre interested Lightly touch his arm shoulder hand or chest during conversation or even lightly âaccidentallyâ bump into him while walking Even minimal contact will draw his attention and let him know youâre flirting Plus when youâre ready to move in for the kiss the touching âbarrierâ between the two of you will already be broken Pay him compliments Guys like girls need all the positive reinforcement they can get Complimenting features you find attractive or beautiful be it his hair personality sense of humor eyes muscles or intelligence can go a long way in letting him know you want to take things to the next level  Ask your boy out on a date or a group date If you donât think heâll go for that meet up with him while heâs with his friends or while youâre with your friends You can also suggest meeting up at a party In any case itâs important to eliminate as many spectators as possible to create a more intimate âkiss worthyâ moment   Make it easy for him to get you alone Try not to include your friends if youâre meeting up Guys are often leery about making contact with a girl when her friends surround her as they often do not share the same opinion about a particular boy Remember guys need as much positive reinforcement as possible Girls can often serve as static to this situation one youâd prefer to be crystal clear Suggest the two of you go for a walk together Thereâs nothing like spending some time outside be it outside of a party or just enjoying the day A walk provides the perfect opportunity to create a kissing environment and utilize your flirting abilities Offer to help with tedious chores or errands If your boy is buying groceries grabbing a cup of coffee cleaning or paying bills offer to be his copilot This situation will not only demonstrate interest but offer a perfect chance to be alone   Make sure your body language is open welcoming and reinforcing How you carry yourself will send either the right or wrong signals to your kissing mate Make sure your shoulders are facing him if sitting next to him that youâre visibly interested in what heâs talking about smiling and nodding are good for this and that youâre maintaining light contactAvoid crossing your arms tightly crossing your legs twiddling your thumbs or constantly clasping your hands together These indicate you could be bored with the conversation anxious to leave or that youâre generally not enjoying yourself This is the last thing you want to do when youâre trying to kiss a boy Donât be afraid to show how nervous you are A healthy bit of nervousness can show your boy how excited you are to be around him The most obvious signs can act as positive reinforcement and physically articulate how much you like him and are enjoying yourself   Do not force the situation especially if youâre not sure if your boy is ready to be kissed When the time is right chances are heâll be doing the exact same things you are to ensure a kiss will happen   Be prepared to create more opportunities to be alone Your first gettogether with your potential kissing mate may not go as planned Do not be discouraged â your boy may need more obvious hints or efforts to fully comprehend whatâs going on Remember to stay confident and patient   Itâs important that you lock eyes with your intended kissing mate Not only does eye contact create an intimate moment it can also drop the hint that youâre ready to do more than talk   Locking eyes can create that particular romantic moment youâre looking for with your boy Such a moment can break the barrier and change a meet up from casual to ideal for kissing  Find a reason or excuse to be close to your boy If youâre out walking say youâre cold If youâre sitting somewhere use the same excuse When youâre sure the moment is right find any excuse to be close to your boyâs lips   Being close to your boy can serve as an indication of how interested or ready to kiss he is Be prepared to maintain your patience if you donât get the reaction you desire He may need a bit more time   If youâre unsure whether or not your boy is ready to fully smooch break the kiss barrier with a kiss on the cheek The way your boy reacts may indicate whether or not heâs ready to kiss you be it later on in the night or the next time you see him   Make sure he knows itâs not just a friendly kiss Instead of simply pecking him on the cheek linger a bit during the kiss Make sure your lips feel soft against a good spot on his cheek Itâs important that even this kiss is memorable so do it somewhere close to his ear or near his mouth   After youâre close and have maintained eye contact your boy should get the hint that youâre ready for a fullon smooch Make sure your lips are light and soft welcoming him to take the lead if needed Line up your nose with his nose and turn slightly to the right or left to avoid collision In any case a light kiss will be much more welcoming and enjoyable to your boy over a hard deep kiss A good technique to use is to lean in and right before your lips meet his hold off a bit This will create a sense of longing in your boy and allow him to close the gap This way youâll know for sure that the situation is mutual If you make your lips into a tight pucker you may send the wrong signal This may indicate you were not ready for a full kiss or that youâre generally not enjoying it and uncomfortable with whatâs happening   You can put your hands to great use and indicate â and even increase â the level of enjoyment by letting your hands roam Run your hands along the back of his head lightly caress his neck or even let your fingers run through his hair during the kiss   Your hands can also pull your boy in closer to heighten the level of the kiss and make it easier to maneuver around each otherâs faces Make sure youâre not too rough or forward when caressing his neck back or hair as it may send the wrong signal Remember youâre just at the kissing stage with your boy Other sorts of affections will come later and when youre ready   After youâve initiated the first kiss you can also add more variety to the situation by changing the way you kiss You can begin by lightly changing the intensity and speed in which youâre kissing The trick is to keep the kissing interesting and enjoyable rather than long and tedious   You can significantly up your kissing game by lightly sucking on your boys lower lip If he likes it chances are heâll return the favor This technique can heighten the experience for the both of you and make the situation that much more memorable Remember never make it too intense as you donât want to make the situation memorable in an awkward way   Nothing makes a kiss more memorable than transforming it to a French kiss A French kiss is reminiscent of all those black and white Hollywood hits and has really become the standard when it comes to romance   To French kiss you open your mouth slightly â only enough to ease your tongue through â before lightly touching his lips with it Donât let your tongue linger for too long If your boy returns the gesture heâs ready to French kiss The rest of the kiss involves turning your head slightly to the side to avoid nose and teeth collision Move your tongue into his mouth and lightly caress his tongue with yours Chances are heâll be doing the same thing Remember to keep your tongue moving otherwise it will simply be resting inside his mouth Be sure to change the pace and intensity while French kissing Like a normal kiss the moment can quickly move from passionate and romantic to boring and tedious if kept too routine   Make sure you leave your boy wanting more If youâve utilized your hands tried a few kissing techniques and let the kiss linger chances are it was a fun and enjoyable experience If your boy enjoyed it heâll want to

Remember even though you may want her to become your girlfriend you arenât there yet For now show her the same amount of attention that you would to any other girl or friend Value quality over quantity when it comes to hanging out Only give her presents when it is appropriate like her birthday and holidays Make the most of these occasions by using inside jokes and knowledge to find her a gift that she will really love and appreciate Donât go overboard and smother her with flowers every Friday and chocolates every Monday Always arrange to hang out ahead of time Donât make her feel backed into a corner by just showing up on her doorstepOnly surprise her by showing up unannounced if youâre part of a larger audience like at a concert or play that she is performing in   Make it clear that she has to fit herself into your schedule Donât tip your hand by putting your friends family and other interests on the backburner If you already have plans with someone else stick to it Note how much she wrote whenever she texts messages or emails you When you write back limit yourself to the same length or even shorter Resist the urge to outdo her and write a novel Instead keep it to a simple backandforth so she doesnât feel overburdened by keeping up with youAlso take note of how often she messages you Stick to the same level of frequency Text call or email her at random to show her that she is on your mindBut donât do it so much that you come across as obsessed or needy   Remember that she has other stuff going on in her life Take a breath and relax Give her time to text or call you back even if it takes a few hours or even a couple days Show her that you respect the fact that other things require her attentionDonât badger her by following up with a second call or message just to see if she got your first one If she never gets back to you before you bump into each other again let it go unmentioned Remember calling her out on not calling you back will only hurt your chances in the end
Crushes are the stuff that dreams are made of and they reveal more about you than you may think This is the effect of early adolescence when young girls and boys begin to grow out of childhood For example   When you see someone you like and your heart begins to beat faster or your palms may become sweaty or it feels like butterflies are in your stomach this is your body reacting to chemicals in your brain called dopamine Also known as the pleasure chemical You may think about your crush constantly When you wake up when you eat and when you sleep they are on your mind It will feel like youre dreaming Do your best to not feel embarrassed by these side effects of liking someone These are all natural chemical reactions in the body Release yourself from the expectation of anything happening Just relax in the feeling of liking the person It may seem like a difficult thing to do But it will free you from any outcome   These new feelings may seem overwhelming and having an outlet for them could help you make sense of them   Write love notes to your crush or create a Feelings Journal Keep everything you write to yourself Make a playlist of songs that remind you of your crush Play the songs when you cant see or talk to the person Or you can save it for the special day when you do decide to reveal your feelings  Become a secret admirer of your crush But dont stalk the person For example   Notice the little things about your crush There are obvious things you like about your crush like their beauty or sense of humor But also take the time to notice other things people might overlook Maybe they snort when they laugh or they have a small visible birthmark Anything that makes them different learn to appreciate it Get to know your crush secretly You can find out if they have social media accounts What do they post about If they post about a specific sports team or musician do some research Or maybe they like something you like too   Its solely up to you if you want anyone to know about your feelings Be as private as you like Heres how   Remember no one can read your mind Dont worry you have the choice of spilling your secret And if anyone asks you can deny or brush it off If youve written about your feelings keep it to yourself Make sure what youve written is in a safe place where no one can find it Try to act normal around the person you like Dont bring any attention to your behavior Remind yourself they are a regular person even if your mind tries to tell you otherwise
Naturally dont change yourself just try to see if some of those interests enthuse you and adjust a little  Do this progressively so as not to freak her out with your sudden interest in her sporting activities   Ask her about some sports and video games riding bikes and outdoor activities Try some things she does and see if you like the game or the sport or activity   Most girls love funny guys even if they are tomboys Even if its bad puns be funny Its vital   It is not really a good idea to compliment a tomboy on her outfit The chances are that she became a tomboy to avoid the whole girlygirl cutesy thing   Girls and tomboys dont like guys hitting on them when they have a boyfriend already   Do this in a way that isnt that noticeable and more by way of mateship If you persevere and keep it casual but kind after a time she will start to find herself liking you   Show affection Talk to her as much as possible Joke around   After awhile if she shows signs that she likes you too then you can turn up the flirting a notch Dont play too easy though then she wont feel that she is powerful and most girls like thinking they have a sense of power over love Love should be shared not be a power struggle   Make physical contact Hold her hand and look them in the eye and say something funny then smile Its often the way that tomboys make friends and it gets easier for you both if the guy puts his hand on her shoulder or just tries to grab her hair   If she is the confident tomboy many tomboys are then she might either ask you out or tell you she likes you If she doesnt do this then ask her out   For example a baseball game or a Minecraft night Most definitely dont ask to go to the mall or a restaurant that requires anything fancy since tomboys would show up in jeans anyway
You can go all out and make something elaborate or you can keep it simple â itâs up to you Itâs what you say in the card that matters If you arenât very artistic get a piece of red construction paper fold it in half and use that as your card You can also draw paint or even make a collage on it Get creative   If you know your crush likes a certain animal or activity you can draw or make a collage based on that Your card doesnât have to be handmade although your crush might find it particularly sweet if it is  You can write a long note anytime but if you just want to ask your sweetie to be your valentine write something simple in your card You could say âWould you beââ on the front of the card then write ââmy valentineâ on the inside For a little something extra you could write a compliment like âYou look nice todayâ   You could also write âJust wanted to knowââ on the outside and on the inside say âWill you be my valentineâ   If you want your crush to know itâs you right away sign your name on the inside To be a little more mysterious sign the card as âYour Secret Admirerâ or âYour Hopeful Valentineâ You donât have to write âLoveâ or anything serious like that if you donât want to You could put âxoâ which means âhugs and kissesâ   For example you could write âDear Helen Will you be my Valentine If yes please meet me at the park at 400 xoxo Janeâ   If youâre feeling brave you can always walk right up to your crush and hand them the card However its pretty normal to feel shy about it so you dont have to do it that way You can always leave the note somewhere theyâll be sure to find it   For example you could put it in their locker slip it in their backpack when they arenât looking or put it in one of their text books For an extra special touch you can leave a single flower with the note Roses are popular but you donât have to be that traditional
If you do find a monkey has entered a residential area you shouldnt panic but you should be prepared Keep some big sticks a hose or another water spraying device handy at home If you see a monkey you can scare if off without harming it Monkeys will quickly learn that your neighbourhood is not a good place for them to return toDo not approach the monkey directly do not stare at it and do not try to corner it Identify an exit and encourage the monkey to leave by hitting the ground with a stick Never hit a monkey A strong jet of water directed toward the monkey can also encourage it towards the exitIf there are juveniles in a group of monkeys be especially cautious Lower your head keep your distance and move away In extreme circumstances it might be necessary to construct an electric fence around your settlement to stop monkeys from entering This is not a straightforward task and you should ensure you have taken the less dramatic steps of securing all bins and closing off any food sources before considering this There is evidence that electric fences are effective at containing monkeys and are unlikely to harm the animals if done correctly but you will need expert help for thisIf you think your monkey problem is this serious contact a local government representative and ask them about electric fencing If will not be cheap and in no circumstances should you attempt this on your own   Increasingly places and institutions frequented by monkeys are turning to ultrasound repellent devices to ward off the monkeys These devices tend to be used where there are lots of people coming and going and it is hard to ensure that no rubbish or food waste is left accessible to monkeys in the area   The sounds cause stress and discomfort for monkeys in the area who will move away and avoid the sound The impact on the monkeys health and wellbeing is uncertain and the preventative methods should be used in the first instance

Lumps on guinea pigs often require veterinary treatment Frequently treatment involves surgical removal of the lumpIf the lump is infected your guinea pig would need antibiotics to prevent the spread of infection after surgery   Do not try to treat a lump on your own  Removing a guinea pigâs lump can be challenging If the lump is infected surgically removing it could release bacteria into the bloodstream causing a serious condition called septicemiaAlso the pus within a guinea pig abscess has a thick cheeselike consistency making the typical abscess treatmentâlancing and drainingâineffective in many casesLancing an abscess involves cutting it open with a sharp instrument   Sometimes abscesses can form fingerlike extensions and extend into nearby tissues making complete removal difficultMouth abscesses are very challenging to treat because of their location They can swell and block the throat In addition if the abscess breaks open the pus could fatally choke a guinea pigRemoving a cyst may be challenging as well since the fluid inside of it may contain bacteria   If your guinea pig can undergo surgery your vet will anesthetize your guinea pig and remove the lump In most cases a guinea pig can go home on the same day of surgery However if your guinea pig has a mouth abscess your vet may want to hospitalize your guinea pig because of the potential for serious health problemsFor an abscess complete removal is very important If the removal is incomplete the abscess could come backSurgical removal of a skin tumor is curative meaning that no other treatment is needed to treat the tumor Lancing may be a good option for mouth or jaw abscesses After anesthetizing your guinea pig your vet would first cut open the abscess and drain the fluid with a surgical drain Next they would flush the empty abscess with an antiseptic solution Then your vet may pack the empty abscess with antibiotic beads Be aware that this treatment option makes it more likely for an abscess to come backFlushing the abscess means to fill it with a liquid solution the antiseptic then suction the liquid back out Your vet may have to flush the abscess several times to make sure all of the pus is out The antibiotic beads would be effective for 2â6 months Not all abscesses require surgical removal If your guinea pigâs abscess is less than 1 cm in diameter your vet could inject antibiotics directly into the abscess Your vet would inject the antibiotic into the abscessâs wall Alternatively your vet may want to flush the abscess periodically rather than removing itFlushing the abscess periodically will help prevent the abscess from causing problems Your vet will let you know how often the abscess should be flushed   When you bring your guinea pig home after surgery let it recover in a calm quiet areaPlace your guinea pigâs cage in an area that does not get a lot of foot traffic from you or other members of your household If you have other guinea pigs keep them in a separate cage from the sick guinea pig   If the surgicallyremoved lump was an abscess or infected cyst your guinea pig will need antibiotics to prevent postsurgical infectionBecause certain antibiotics can make guinea pigs extremely sick your vet will prescribe a guinea pigsafe antibiotic Do not purchase antibiotics at a pet store they may not be safe for your guinea pigGuinea pigs typically need at least one round of antibiotics following surgical removal of an abscessYour vet will determine how long your guinea pig will need antibiotic treatment To give the antibiotic pill hold your guinea pig open its mouth and put the pill as far back in the mouth as you can If you can place the pill near the molars your guinea pig will not be able to spit it back out easilyGive the full course of antibiotics Do not stop the antibiotic treatment when your guinea pig starts looking and feeling better This could lead to the growth of antibioticresistant bacteria   After surgery keep the incision site clean and free of dirt and debrisTo clean the incision site use a clean slightly damp towel and gently dab around the incision That area may be a little painful for your guinea pig so you do not want to use too much pressure   Examine the incision site for signs of infection redness swelling discharge If the incision site looks abnormal take your guinea pig to your vet for treatment   Your vet may want to see your guinea pig again after surgery to monitor its recovery During this followup appointment your vet will examine the incision area remove sutures if necessary and generally assess how your guinea pig is doing   You will not be able to prevent tumors but you can prevent abscesses and cysts Because abscesses and cysts form after a puncture wound remove anything sharp or rough from your guinea pigâs cage For example straw bedding can pierce a guinea pigâs skinInstead of straw bedding use paper bedding like CareFreshÂ or Yesterdayâs News cat litterIf any of your guinea pigâs toys have sharp edges take those out as well Ideal toys for a guinea pig cage are empty toilet paper or paper towel rolls since they are soft and smooth Make sure your guinea pigâs food does not have any sharp edges that could damage his gums   If you house several guinea pigs together separate them if they fight or bully each otherWhen they bite each other that bite wound can become infected and form an abscess or cyst   Malocclusion improper teeth alignment is a common dental problem in guinea pigsIf the teeth do not line up properly they can overgrow and puncture the inside of the mouth This puncture wound can lead to abscess or cyst If your guinea pigâs teeth are misaligned take your guinea pig to your vet for treatment   Correcting dental problems in guinea pigs requires surgery Your vet will use specialized dental instruments to trim and realign the teeth

Allow him to make plans for getting together Note how much of his free time he devotes to you The more time he wants to spend with you the more he caresAllow some leeway if your schedules are busy or conflicting because of work school or family functions But if he has all the free time in the world and only wants to see you once a week consider that a sign of ambivalence  Note how frequently he calls emails or texts you If he contacts you regularly consider that a sign that he wants to be part of your life Give him a little grace period if heâs extremely busy but also note how much effort he makes to keep in touch in spite of thatOn the other hand watch out if hes calling way too much If he calls you when he knows youre busy with work family or studying and still expects you to drop everything and talk to him that probably means he cares less about your needs and more about his own   When you arenât going to see each other anytime soon ask him what heâll be up to Gauge his willingness to answer If he seems cagey and vague consider that a sign that he doesnât care enough about you to share all of his life with you If heâs forthcoming and lets you know what his plans are at any given hour take it as a sign of honesty and inclusionTake him at his word when he tells you what hell be up to Dont sneak around and spy on him to make sure hes telling the truth unless he gives you a very good reason to If he does care about you and catches you stalking him he might take that as a sign of mistrust which could hurt your relationship   Every now and then say that you need a little alonetime either by yourself or with your own friends See how well he takes it If he respects the fact that everyone needs a little break from each other from time to time take that as a plus But if he demands that you spend every available second with him take that to mean heâs less interested in keeping you happy than keeping himself happyRemember this works both ways Dont be upset if he asks for a night off every now and then so he can spend time with other people or by himself especially if the two of you have been spending a lot of time together recently

likes Who knows He might not end up liking you but you could find a new hobby   Make him laugh and feel comfortable around you However make sure you avoid using any jokes that could offend him you never know what could happen   You dont have to go overboard but the occasional sitting next to him or complimenting him can have a huge impact   The best thing to do in a moment of awkward silence You can also start a conversation like this especially if you want to get off of a topic other than yourself This is also a great way to get to know him a bit better   Consider inviting a few other people with you to avoid an awkward first date night Go to the movies or an arcade or go and get some pizza   You should get him a birthday giftChristmas presents Nothing too big though   When you guys have been talking for a while about 2 to 3 weeks start flirting with him a little bit more Touch his shoulder during conversation or look him right in the eyes when you two are talking But dont look into his eyes in a weird or obsessive gaze or he will flip   Once you guys start hanging out more often ask more personal questions about him and reply honestly when he asks you about your life unless its something personal you dont want to spill and be open to him Let him get to know you but make sure not to take it too fast Dont tell him everything he needs to know about you in your conversations Let him nibble off the cheese and show him little tidbits of yourself That way youll have new conversations every time and you wont be boring Boring topics are the free way to the check out list And avoid lying too The truth will always find its way back to him and it could end up embarrassing you   If its just you two strike up a conversation casually let him know that he can be

still a good tip   The first thing youve got to find out if whether or not hes still got a fire for his ex If thats the case you dont want him as a boyfriend To find out casually ask him Get him to talk about any feelings he has about her whether theyre good or bad Get him to spit out about whether or not hes seen her recently if they still keep in touch etc If you find that hes over her then move on to step two   Let him know in no vague terms that you are 100 over that person who broke your heart Guys are very easily deterred by women who are still hung up on an ex Dont come off like one of those women Thats the quickest way to make sure this guy that you like stays just your friend   Let your guy friend know how much you highly think of him and how much you think he would make a great boyfriend for someone one day Hes probably so used to being nagged debased and mothered by his ex that it will be refreshing to hear that you think he would actually make a fabulous boyfriend   But dont call it a date In its place invite him out to the movies one night as friends If he asks you out the following weekend and you ask him about again the next thing you know you both will find yourself dating   Send him comical text messages and emails Its a fantastic way to build your friendship and future relationship Guys want women they can be themselves with them By letting all hang out youre letting him know that youre fun and cool at the same time   Do this when you two are alone someplace you wont know if his answer is true otherwise A lot of guys say no if theyre around their friends because they dont want to attract attention from everyone else They feel like theyre pressured to say yes because well their friends will rag on them and drive him to no   He means Youre great as a friend I just dont want to be bfgf right now Respect his choice and then stay friends Dont act let down because that will create an oddness between you two which will set you back to almost strangers And if one day he says Hey do you want to catch a movie with me You know as a date then smileyou know youve been waiting and say I thought youd never ask and bite your lip Biting your lip gives you a look of excitement and anxiety which is a good look because then the guy knows youre nervous too   Do the same bite the lip routine And if he goes in for the kiss enjoy every steamy moment of it You cant say you havent known him for long enough because you have as a friend That automatically gives you the right to kiss him right when he asks you out But dont kiss him first let him do the honors and then after a few dates you can make the first moves all you want   There are more fish out there in the sea Youll find that one guy someday

crush   Just dress naturally Some people might get intimidated if you try getting really dressed up around your crush You want to act naturally and be yourself not like youre something youre not Focus more on clothes that help you feel confident If you want to impress your crush youll do it with your personality not with your shirt Make sure your clothes fit well are clean and make you feel good

you need them   Breath strips act quickly and are easy to carry around in your pocket so you dont have to be chewing gum constantly while youre trying to flirt Check in the mirror after meals to make sure you dont have anything stuck in your teeth That could be embarrassing after the fact   Again you dont need to be a movie star to attract your crush or to act naturally around them but its a whole lot easier to be relaxed and confident around someone if youre not worried about the smell youre putting off Shower regularly and take care of basic body stuff so you can feel confident   If you have acne problems talk to your parents and your doctor about prescription solutions There are lots of stronger medicated facial soaps out there to try Dont suffer in silence Put some thought into your hair and basic grooming You dont need to be glammed up all the time but dont look like you just rolled out of bed   Hanging around someone youre attracted to can be hard if you dont know much about them You might want to impress them or come off like an attractive and interesting person but what do they think is attractive What do they think is interesting The more you know the answers to these questions the more comfortable you can be   Get to know them on social networking first Reach out on Facebook or Twitter and become friends or start following them on Instagram to get some sense of their sense of humor and style Talk to mutual friends to find out things like whether or not your crush has a partner already or whether or not your crush might be interested Its a lot easier to chat up someone who you think might like you   Oneonone hangouts can be challenging If youre trying to hang out with someone do it in a group so your crush can see how you act naturally around your friends instead of trying to do it all at once   Invite your crush to hang out with your friends or just to sit with your friends at lunch There doesnt need to be a reason Alternatively you might feel more comfortable hanging out oneonone If you do try to find reasons to hang out with your crush solo even in a nondate type of situation Just try sitting together on the bus or working on homework together or sitting together at lunch   Lots of people make the mistake of thinking that you need to talk a lot and make a big show if you want to attract someones attention Not necessarily the case Hang back a little and make your contributions magnetic and more meaningful when you do talkTalk more quietly so everyone else needs to quiet down when you speak Turn to your crush and lean in when you have something to say Make it meaningful Itll be mysterious and personal Your crush might be attracted to more flamboyant loud or chatty people and thats ok That doesnt mean you need to change who you are to attract them or get to know them better   Its important to let your crush know that you exist and that you like talking to them When you see your crush walking down the hallway at school or passing them in public smile brightly wave your hand and say hi Use their name out loud This little gesture goes a long way in making someone feel valuable and wanted   This isnt a sign that youre crushing on someone its just a sign that youre nice If you see someone you like say hello   When you like someone making eye contact can do more than a couple thousand words and a bunch of love letters When youre hanging out or having a conversation make eye contact and use gentle body language to seem more approachable   Use open body language around your crush keeping your shoulders back and your arms uncrossed Dont stare at someone you like Catching someones eye and smiling is one thing but gawking at someone you think is attractive during class will just come across as creepy   When youre first getting to know your crush a little better try to keep your interactions brief to avoid any awkwardness or difficulty in talking Just chat up someone about the class you just had or have a brief talk about your weekend plans then say Well nice talking See you later   Dont worry too much about having really deep or interesting conversations Itll happen as you get to know someone better which takes time Nobody has great conversations at first Give them a chance   Dont know what to talk about try to figure out something that you have in common and can share together Talk about a class youve got together or an assignment or talk about an upcoming sports event at your school Find something you can shoot the breeze about   Dont think too hard If you live in the same town or go to the same school youve automatically got a little in common Talk about your neighborhood Gossip about common friends Complain about teachersOnline is a great way to find out simple things like this If you know your crush watches a certain show that you like talk about the last episode or your favorite characters or what you think is going to happen next   One good shortcut to starting a conversation is to ask your crush if theyll help you do something Ask for a hand with some homework assignment youre working on or ask for some help setting something up in gym class Even if youre fine on your own itll be a chance to have some time to talk   Go with a little white lie if you need to Have you seen my math book over here I just had it and I cant find it Will you help me look Then chat while you try to find it When you never can say Thats ok youre so sweet for helping I like talking to you   If you want to get to know someone better and maybe even get them to like you its a good idea to let your sense of humor out as much as possible Laughter is infectious and people like being around people who are funny Even if youre not a class clown you can still have funny conversations with your crush   Dont say Hey hows it going Thats a boring conversation to start Instead say Im thinking of busting out of this prison So far all Ive got is a calculator and half a Snickers What do you think Can I count on you Youre not going to tell the cops right If your crush says something like Youre weird then you know theyre a boring or stuckup person Dont waste your time getting to know people who dont share your sense of humor   Some studies show that gentle teasing can cause magnetic reactions in people causing our brains to attract where we might naturally rejectPeople dont want to be put on pedestals and complimented all the time This is boringThis is also while lots of nice people are rejected by crushes who are looking for something more interesting That doesnt mean you should be a jerk just that you should learn to let your sense of humor out in gentle ways   If you see your crush put up a bunch of selfies on Facebook tease them about them Ok there are a lot of these so Im going to help you rate them one by one in terms of what it looks like youre thinking This one says Oh wow my room smells like corndogs   People like for conversation to be easy If you want to put your crush at ease and get them talking asking creative engaging or even silly questions is the way to go Treat it like a fun conversation game   Say this is your last day on earth Where do you go first What do you eat What do you do Who do you hang out with Whats on the iPod Its important to avoid prying or coming off like youre insensitive Dont ask questions that are none of your business like Your dad doesnt look like he makes a lot of money how is your family doing   Not sure what to talk about Follow up on something that you already talked about If your crush mentioned a big event one weekend follow up and ask how it went the next time you see them try to remember the things you talk about so youll have a store of new conversations to pick up on   If your crush mentioned a book show or movie last time that you were unfamiliar with check it out and talk about it the next time you see each other Be honest and offer your opinions   If you want to get to know your crush even better its important to engage with their group of friends Treat your crush as a close friend and try to hang out in your crushs circle of friends as much as possible   Invite your crush to hang out with you on group events as well try to get your crush to hang out in a group with your friends so itll be more comfortable and fun Get to know your crush in a group Find out what your crush likes what your crush

Letâs face it It may be hard to get complete privacy in middle school but you have to do the best you can to make sure that you and your girlfriend can step away from your friends to get some time together You could step outside during the school dance find some solo time during a party or even go out on a date together Just do the best you can to make sure that thereâs no chance that your friends can barge in and start making fun of you and ruin the mood   Avoid trying this in school for the first time Youâve got to find a slightly more romantic location This doesnât mean you should try to kiss your girlfriend the second youâre alone together The moment has to feel right and privacy isnât the only requirement for that  If youâre ready to kiss your girlfriend then your breath better be ready too You donât have to make dramatic gestures and eat ten breath mints but you should brush your teeth if you know youâre going to see your girlfriend soon And if youâve both just eaten a meal just quickly chew a piece of gum Donât make a big deal about it or sheâll know that youâre selfconscious about kissing her   You can also put on some lip balm a few hours before to soften up your lips but donât use it right before you make a move or your lips wonât feel too pleasant   Once youâve got her alone you canât just swoop in for the kiss or it will feel a bit forced Instead you have to show your girlfriend that you care about her by making her feel special Give her a compliment like âYou look so pretty tonightâ or say something nice like âIâve had so much fun with you todayâ You donât have to try too hard to show her that you really do care about her Turn off your phone look into her eyes and show her that she has your undivided attention   If you want to kiss your girlfriend then she has to feel like you really like her for who she is and that you see her as more than just a person to kiss   Before you kiss your girlfriend you have to make sure that youâre on the same page This is probably your first kiss and it may be her first kiss too so you really want her to feel ready to make this move with you Though you donât have to think of kissing her as a huge deal it will be something sheâll remember so you have to see if sheâs into it See if sheâs moving closer to you looks happy to see you looks at your lips and selfconsciously touches her face or plays with her hair This is a sign that sheâs interested in kissing you and that she may be a little nervous   If sheâs always trying to pull away when youâre alone together and moves further and further away from you then she may not be ready to take it to the next level with you This doesnât mean that she doesnât like you but it does mean that sheâs not ready yet   You shouldnât go from standing two feet apart from your girlfriend to planting a big wet one on her face or sheâll be caught off guard Instead move closer to her and make some physical contact If youâre sitting you can sit closer to her put your hand on her knee or play with her hair If youâre standing you can also touch her hair or her face brush a hand along her waist or just give her some kind of physical closeness to show that youâre ready to make a move   This will also be a good time to see if sheâs ready Does she respond well to your touch move closer to you or even initiate some touching   If youâre kissing your girlfriend in middle school for the first time there are a few things you may want to avoid    French kissing This is not for everybody and most people donât start French kissing until high school For your first kiss keep the tongue out of it or your girlfriend may be unpleasantly surprised If you come out of the gate with a French kiss itâll be too much too soon The roaming hands Just because your girlfriend is ready for a kiss doesnât mean sheâs ready for you to start creeping all over her body You can touch her in safe PG areas to show her that you care but you donât want to creep her out by suddenly touching her in a place where sheâs definitely not ready to be touched The sneak attack kiss Avoid just jumping in and kissing her without any indication of whatâs going to happen Though some element of surprise is nice you donât want your girlfriend to not know whatâs going on when you make your big move   Once youâve made physical contact all you have to do is move a bit closer to her until your faces are very close together If youâre sitting then youâll both have to turn your bodies a bit If youâre standing you can put your arms around her waist and move closer to her This should happen slowly and naturally and you can make eye contact while you get closer   You can lightly lick your lips a bit to soften them if youâre not too obvious about it   You donât want to kiss your girlfriend head on or your noses will get in the way You should tilt your head slightly in one direction and she should tilt her head slightly in the other Donât worry if you donât get it perfect the first time or if you both donât tilt your heads that much This isnât so crucial for a regular kiss so donât overthink it and tilt your head too much   Hereâs your big moment Just lean forward a bit and make the connection touching your lips to hers Your lips wonât align perfectly and you donât have to worry about it Relax your lips instead of puckering them and just gently kiss your girlfriendâs lips You can hold the kiss for a few seconds or for as long as you both like   This is something you can do while you kiss your girlfriend if you donât think it requires too much coordination Just lightly run your hand over her cheeks or her hair while youâre kissing her This can be something you do during Round Two if you go in for another kiss after the first kiss is over   While youâre kissing her you can place your hands on her waist her upper back or her knee or shoulder if youâre sitting down As long as youâre not touching her anywhere inappropriate a little bit of touch can help the girl feel more in the moment Donât overwhelm her though If sheâs not touching you except with her lips only a bit of a light touch on your end will be enough   This sounds silly but itâs important You may be so nervous or excited about finally kissing your girlfriend that you may forget to perform one of the most basic functions of the human being That means breathing in and out just as you normally would while youâre kissing her If you only kiss for a few seconds breathing before and after is OK too   After a few seconds you can slowly pull away while continuing to look into your girlfriendâs eyes Donât instantly pull away like youâve been scorched by a flame Instead look at her smile and gently move away You can brush her face or hair for an extra touch   Letâs face it Middle school can be awkward Kissing for the first time can be weird But you should do the best you can to make your girl feel comfortable and to say something like âThat was niceâ to let her know it was a special moment for you Donât just take her hand and walk away to join the party and pretend it never happened It can be hard for guys to express their feelings but just do the best you can to make the girl feel special and to let her know you had a great time   And hey nobodyâs stopping you from going in for that second kiss If the first kiss went well itâs okay to pull away and to go back for moreâand more again
It is easier said than done but often times the best way to get attention from a guy is to exude confidence and be yourself You can start by making sure you feel good about how you look There is no perfect weight or perfect style All that matters is that you find a look that makes you feel confidentBrowse some magazines for outfit ideas and pick out some clothes you like If you donât have a lot of money check out local thrift stores or resale shops Decide on a hairstyle that feels good for you Wake up early enough to groom and get ready before school  Donât feel like you need to act shy or meek to get attention In fact that usually fails to work Instead let your strengths shine You can show your confidence and embrace your talents without being boastful and arrogant so donât be afraid of the spotlight That is where heâs most likely to notice you Plus when you own and embrace your talents you come off as confident and attractive Maybe your strengths include   Your sense of humor Your athleticism Your good grades   The way you talk to yourself or about yourself has a huge impact on the way you feel about yourself Start boosting your confidence from the inside out by keeping track of the way you talk As a general rule dont say anything about yourself that you wouldnt say about your best friend   Instead of thinking I am terrible at soccer think When I practice my soccer moves I feel better If something goes wrong try to stop your thoughts from spiraling You can think I made a mistake but I can decide how the rest of my day goes Make a deal with your friends to correct each other if you hear negative self talk   Motivate yourself and boost your positivity by setting aside a few minutes each day to write down positive affirmations and read them back to yourself For added benefit post them places you often look such as on your mirror near your computer monitor or inside your school locker  Write down positive statements such as âYou are worthy of love and supportâ âEverything will work out in the endâ or âYou can do itâ You can find great quotes online if youâre struggling to come up with affirmations   Confident people are viewed as being more attractive and desirable The way you hold your body and interact with other people communicates a lot about your confidence level Show your confidence by making eye contact and smiling at people Practice holding your body in confident ways and in time you will begin to feel it on the inside tooYou might try   Keeping your shoulders back leading with your heart Avoid slouching or hunching Hold your head high you can practice balancing a book on your head Practice your social skills
Itâs difficult to put yourself out there without healthy selfesteem and a sense of confidence and shyness is common in middle school A big part of selfconfidence is being more aware of yourself Writing down a list of your strengths and weaknesses can help you uncover your best attributes Play these up when interacting with a boy you like   For example if you have a great smile be sure to use it often around the boy Identifying your weaknesses can help you make improvements   Along with confidence one of the best ways to make yourself more noticeable to a boy is to look approachable Smiling gives the instant impression that you are friendly and approachable Making eye contact is also important but be careful not to stare  A big part of confidence is looking and feeling your best It doesnât mean being overly fancy just wear clothes that make you happy and it will be easy to project a confident image to the boy you like For example if you feel comfortable and attractive in certain outfits wear them when you know you will see him   It can be easy to get wrapped up in having a crush on a boy in middle school but spending some time on your own interests such as sports clubs or other hobbies can make you look more confident with yourself Pursuing your interests may even give you something to talk about with the boy youâre trying to impress   Nothing kills confidence faster than comparing yourself to your peers Itâs easy to feel inadequate when thinking about what you donât have so itâs important to minimize these feelings if you want to get the attention of a boy you like   Be cautious when it comes to social media Many teens spend a lot of time projecting a particular image through their social media profiles but this is often an exaggeration Try not to dwell on what your peers are posting on social media because it can harm your selfesteem
Whether you are teaching a skill delivering information or increasing awareness outline the goals of your workshop What do you want your workshop participants to learn This analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching concrete topics you will cover or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants Think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is importantSome examples of workshop objectives include   Learn how to write a persuasive cover letter Learn how to break bad news to a patient Learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class Learn how to create an effective Powerpoint presentation  Will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers Will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it Are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training Answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshopFor example if your audience already knows each other you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly If they are complete strangers you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions   These are the times when participants are most awake and alert  You want your participants to be fully engaged and aware If you can avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient Pass around flyers hang up posters or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation Having a catchy title helps as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessaryBe sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch peoples attention   A workshop is not the same as a large lecture You want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions practice their skills and work together But you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting Ideally a workshop will have 815 participantsSometimes you dont have a choice about your group size If you have a very large group find creative ways to make sure the size doesnt become overwhelming For example a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different breakout groups of 8 participants each You could also bring in cofacilitators and copresenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal   Some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place Perhaps they have to study journal articles write a short story or read one anothers work If your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning   Be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time Be clear about where and how your students should submit their work Will they have to give you hard copies or will you circulate materials by email   Most workshops are timelimited They can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days But no matter what you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participantsRather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time think about the most important skills techniques and information you want your audience to gain Prioritize those in your lesson plan   Adults learn in all kinds of ways visually orally through handson practice or any combination of the aboveRemember that you might not know your participants learning styles ahead of time so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared Depending on the topic and objective of your workshop you might want to prepare paper handouts audiovisual aids computerbased lesson plans and roleplaying activities Readings case studies lists of key terms and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare It is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time That way you can catch typos or errors Be sure to use a large easytoread font Give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future   If you have lengthy readings consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in preparedIf you are handing out numerous documents consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized If you give this workshop often enough you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees   If you plan to present a slideshow video clips or sound clips you will have to prepare these ahead of time Test them at home to make sure they are working correctly Make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space   It is wise to consult with your venues av technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly Not all projectors are compatible with Macintosh computers for example And some rooms might not have sound projection Make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use   If your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum you will need to organize these materials ahead of timeThink about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices and notify them if so   If your participants will be expected to do activities online be sure to consult with your venues av technician You will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet and you might have to ask for the networks password in advance   Depending on the topic and size of your workshop you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning An expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group If you require help from anyone make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time The more prepared they are the better your workshop will be   Interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning Brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshops objectives Keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs small groups or as a full group Make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop Some possible group activities include   Debates Break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position Thinkpairshares Ask your participants a discussion question Have them think about it on their own discuss their thoughts with a partner and then share their conclusions with the full group Questionandanswer sessions If you have a lot of information to present include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material You can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them Roleplaying activities Assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning Brainstorming sessions Ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of Write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard Then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with   People are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaksThey are also more likely to remember what they have learned Schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5minute break per hour of your workshop This will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable   Actual activities can often take 1020 more time than we estimateIf you think a qanda session will last 10 minutes it might very well last 12 minutes or longer Build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover Resist the urge to cram in as much as possible your participants will feel tired and rushed   If you are worried that your workshop will end early you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning If you have time for them great And if not no harm done   Workshops take a lot of work and energy Help keep your participants energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beveragesIdeally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop You should not have to pay for snacks outofpocket   Try to avoid junk foods Unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon That will leave your participants bored and tired Aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit vegetables hummus and whole grain breads Leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room You might have to meet with av technicians caterers or your team members before your workshop begins as well Give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make lastminute adjustments to your workshop plan Computers laptops projectors and speakers will all have to be finetuned in advance After all you want your workshop time to be productive you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology If you can see if you can have the venues av technician assist you with the setup You might not be familiar with the rooms technological capabilities and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently   The way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group the size of the room and the activities you have planned Ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semicircle this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversationIf everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo perhaps a semicircle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate If you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop Make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled Other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include   Snacks and beverages Nametags and markers Pens and pencils   Arriving early allows you to set up relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop This helps in building relationships with the participants   Once everyone is seated you will have to orient them to your workshop Be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you Give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it Explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important It is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared Try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes   Even if your topic is a serious one consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another Explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them For example you can ask people to fill out nametags grab a cup of coffee and make sure they have their handouts If you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away you can tell them when those materials will be needed   Ask your participants to introduce themselves Limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop You dont want the icebreakers to go on forever but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group   You can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a lighthearted question like What is your favorite movie or What is your favorite bad song   This is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action Have your outline in front of you and try to stick to the outline if you can Feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why Your lesson plan doesnt have to be a surprise and your participants might appreciate being told why youve organized the workshop in the way that you did For example you might tell them   First we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances After that we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem Were going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program After I explain these terms well take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page After that we will open things up for discussion Please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you In a few minutes you will roleplay a counselorstudent interaction with your partner   It is good to have a plan for your workshop but be prepared to alter your workshops content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants Build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions concerns and interestsYou can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on This will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content   Always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity Interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problemsolving techniques  A workshop is not the same thing as a lecture and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants Let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them For example you can  Deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions Divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group Show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions Provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to roleplay the scenario Have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique   You do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop Your participants might get bored or annoyedKeep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting it is a format that thrives on interaction activity and group work Scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect Let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks This allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage phone calls and other personal needs Do not skip breaks even if you are running short on time   Attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity View this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem Change up your activities ask your participants to rearrange their chairs or schedule a break at least once every 2030 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated Even if you are treating a serious topic humor can be a great way to emphasize information and keep everyone attentiveThink about ways that you can introduce humor in a responsible ethical way into your presentations discussions and activities This will also encourage your participants to remain relaxed alert and comfortable   Make sure that all of your workshop participants are treated equally and respectfullyThis means that any leadership roles such as group discussion leader should be distributed evenly across the workshop Encourage quiet shy participants to speak You want everyone to feel heard and respected Similarly you do not want a single participants voice or your own voice for that matter to dominate the discussion   Most workshops will run smoothly After all the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn However there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague Be professional no matter what and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behaviorBe clear in what you expect from your participants If you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague consider speaking privately with that person Emphasize the importance of what you are teaching and tell them that you expect adult professional behavior from them   Explain everything that your participants have learned over the course of the sessionThis will help emphasize how far they have come and what new skills they have acquired Refer explicitly to the objectives you laid out at the beginning of the workshop and explain how you think the participants have met those objectives Congratulate your workshop for their hard work and for their new knowledge   Design an evaluation form that your participants can fill out in the last few minutes of the workshop Be sure that you leave them with enough time to comment and consider your questions carefullyImmediate feedback not only will help you improve your workshop but will also help reinforce the learning your participants have undertakenGood questions to ask include  What is the stated objective of this workshop Did the workshop meet its stated objective What activities helped your learning the most The least Was the workshop an appropriate length What workshop materials handouts readings quizzes etc were the most useful Which ones were the least useful How have you learned or grown from this workshop How do you think your colleagues have learned or grown How would you change this workshop in the future Any suggestions for improvements Are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on   Ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input Some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences Following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights You can ask additional questions such as   How well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop Do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop How has the workshop helped you at work Were there ways it could have helped you more What materials have you found useful since the workshop What materials have you thrown away or forgotten about   If enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop consider scheduling a Part 2 In the followup workshop you can address more of their questions dig more deeply into the topic or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in Part 1 Be sure that your followup workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for more advanced attendees
Make sure you talk to your crush in an empty area with none of hisher friends around or your crush might feel intimidated   If you find your crush with hisher friends polite ask your crush May I please talk to you alone real quick     If youre already scared by this step tell yourself inwardly that you have twenty seconds of insane courage to do whatever you want and that itll take one second of humiliation to get nineteen seconds of pride for your bravery     If your crush agrees you can go shopping If your crush declines do not freak out Still keep maintaining that relationship with your crush and treat himher nicely It still has its chances of blossoming into a romantic bond Keep in mind that if you take this calmly your crush might change hisher mind
Its their fault not yours and if its not your fault try confronting them alone and see whats up with how they treat you and if there is a way to solve this problem But keep a friend close by if something goes wrong   try to avoid those specific situations     If youre young like in middle school get a parent to talk to them       If youre an adult and you are in a relationship you may want to consider breaking up Choose the right time to do it         If its teasing or sarcasm just let him know you dont appreciate it and to stop But if its really verbal abuse tell someone It doesnt matter who just tell someone
Whether youre an athlete an artist a singer or a writer spend time doing what makes you happy The first step to getting noticed is feeling or at least appearing confident and comfortable in your own shoes   If youre in your element you wont feel so selfconscious Confidence is attractive and guys can often tell when youre comfortable with yourself Focus on doing what you love and the rest will follow Have a good time with your friends Laugh a lot Guys may find you more attractive if you seem like youre fun to be with Relationships often sprout from common ground If you spend time doing what you love youre more likely to find someone who shares your passions  When you know youre going to see the guy wear your cutest outfit He may notice your outfit and he may notbut you will likely feel more confident and that can make all the differenceConsider wearing clothes that the guy might relate to If youre crushing on a guy whos into music wear a band tshirt If youre crushing on a guy whos into sports wear a shirt or jersey with the name of his favorite team If the guy sees that you have interests in common he may be more likely to think of you You dont need to wear revealing clothing to impress a guy In fact many guys may be turned off by trashy clothing that reveals too much Respect yourself and consider the social consequences of what you wear Consider wearing makeup but dont overdo it A little makeup goes a long way Ask your mother your older sister or another female relative for advice if you havent applied makeup before   Join clubs teams or groups that he has joined and put yourself into a position to grow close to him Make it a natural process   If a guy is involved in the science club consider joining the science club Only do this if you are genuinely interested in the science club this approach only works if you can impress him by being as passionate about his hobby as he is If a guy runs for your schools track team consider joining the team Again only do this is you are genuinely interested in track You dont want to be noticed for the wrong reasons If a guy is in a band consider going to his shows Get to know the scene and compliment him on his music   From time to time gaze over in his direction When he notices you discreetly lock eyes with him for a moment then look away   Smile coyly if youre feeling bold Research indicates that guys are more likely to approach girls when they are given clear signals that their interest is returned smiling will subtly tell him that youre interestedAfter you lock eyes dont look over at him for a while Repeat occasionally He may begin to glance over at you more often to see if you are looking at him Avoid looking at him too often Be flirtatious but dont be creepy If you have mutual friends spending more time with them can be a great way to grow closer to your crush   If his friends like you and see that the two of you have chemistry together they may help convince him to go for you Be careful sometimes getting deep into a guys social circle can complicate matters If you share too many of the same friends your crush may be afraid that asking you out will disrupt the friend group He may worry about the complications that could ensue if the two of you break up down the line Be aware that if you grow close to a guys friends some of them may fall for you instead If you arent open to this be careful with your flirtation   It is one thing to move in the same circles as someone it is another thing to follow him around Stay true to yourself your friends and your interests even as you make an effort to get close to him   Be forward but not forceful dont push yourself upon him Let him notice you for who you are
Try to come up with a reason For example it could be that he has cheated on you or any reason really as long as you make it believable   This will be good as your friends will think you stayed home because you are trying to deal with the breakup   Youre true love will come any day
Even if you have a busy schedule and return home late make sure to call out to your pets If you have a dog he will probably be all over you within seconds of your arrival unless hes busy trying to dig out a bone from his favourite hidden place your couch   Calling out to your pets generates a positive attitude towards them and they feel less threatened If you have a lot of pets call out their names one after the other Kittens usually do not respond if they are asleep so you might need to respect that but they will scurry towards you if they suspect cat treats in the grocery bags you just bought in Remind them that they were missed  Even 20 minutes will help them feel taken care of For more active pets a walk might be a good idea  If your cat has peed on your favourite luggage bag wipe it clean There is nothing much you can do about it except try to take away the pungent smell from the luggage beds or linen they tend to soil The very best and most effective cleanser would be bicarbonate soda andor a little white vinegar You can try a solution of a little detergent mixed with bicarbonate soda a few drops of bleach a tablespoon of vinegar 5 drops of Dettol 2 tablespoons of bicarbonate soda and oodles of water Cats cannot be screamed at because they simply wont understand They will know that you are angry for some reason and rubbing their snouts on the soiled area can repeat their behaviour Carry your cats or kittens to the litter tray and be gentle with them Soon they will learn   Dogs love to travel but only if they get to ride shotgun so invest in a proper and spacey carrier box Kittens like to sneak into dark corners within the car and this can be pretty hazardous if your kittens slip towards the food pedestals Beware invest in spacey and cosy carrier box
The way he talks to you can say a lot about his real feelings for you The next time you hang out pay attention to his tone and the level of attention he gives you when you speak Here are some ways to see if he likes you just based on how you talk to each other   See if he makes eye contact Is he giving you his full attention or looking around the room for something better to do Is he breaking eye contact occasionally but smiling because he feels shy around you See if hes giving you his full attention when he talks to you Is he checking his phone and stopping to talk to other people If so then he may not be trying to impress you But if he talks to you like youre the only person in the world then he may have a big crush on you See if he tries to impress you Does he tell stories that make him look strong funny or adventurous If so then he probably wants to catch your eye See if he talks more softly when heâs around you This may be his way of telling you to lean in to get closer  If the guy has you firmly planted in his friend zone then hell talk to you differently than he would if he was trying to impress you and make you see him as more than a friend You should pay attention not only to how he talks to you but to what he chooses to talk about   See if he reveals personal information If hes opening up to you about trouble with his friends or family then he values your opinion and likes you But if hes opening up to you about a new girl he likes then you may have a problem See if he mentions his childhood This is pretty private for most guys and if he opens up about it then heâs definitely trying to get closer to you See if he compliments you If he tells you that you look nice or finds subtle ways to let you know youre interesting or funny then he may be falling for you See if he teases you If he feels comfortable enough around you to tease you then he might like you See if he tries to be more refined around you If you notice him burping cursing and being generally a little bit gross around his bros but find him never cursing and speaking in a measured and polite way around you then hes trying to impress you   If he talks to you about other girls itll be for one of two reasons Either he likes you and wants to make you jealous or he just sees you as a friend and wants your advice Heres how to find out what it means when he tells you about other ladies   If hes always complaining about women hes dating or says None of them are what Im looking for then he may be hinting that youre the one If he always asks you for romantic advice no matter who hes dating then he may see you as a friend If he says that you give the best advice he may not be looking at you as more than a friend If hes always talking about his latest conquest but not asking for advice he could just be showing off to win you over But be careful  you dont want to end up being just another number in his little black book If he ever compares a girl to you unfavorably by saying something like âSheâs cool but sheâs not nearly as funny as youâ then heâs telling you heâd rather be dating you instead
Not just first name but full name This will help you later Do not just go up to himher and randomly ask try to get around very sneakily You can casually ask a friend and gigglediscuss about himher together or you could pay attention you can do this even when you act like you dont care to when someone says hisher name If you and your crush go to the same school etc check the roll as casually as you can  scouts glance at any forms heshe hands in to see what hisher name is   This can give a clue to the type of person heshe is If they hang out with the popular people then you know that your crush is also the popular type That is just an example   Focus on your conversation but at the same time catch little snippets of what your crush and friends are talking about For instance if you hear your crush say that they love Facebook and limit themselves to half an hour a day go on whenever they say they are usually on and send them a friend request  most likely they will accept itImageFind out More About Your Crush Step 4jpgcenter facebook Myspace etc perfect Go to hisher profile scroll down to as far as you can down their wall and see the comments they make If its facebook you can check out their pics as well Also check out their friends pics because friends tend to put photos up and forget to tag them Remember never talk about facebook conversations to your crush that heshe participated in with their friends This will only make you look like a stalker   Check out the links This can tell quite a bit about your crush   This will give you hisher address and phone number Use the address and go to Google Maps This will tell you where heshe lives You can also compare this to where you live If your crush lives not far you can casually walk down their street daily and hope they notice you If they do just say hi Only continue a conversation if they start it The phone number can be useful in different situations
Not just any other friend become someone that they couldnt live without someone who listens to all their problems and always helps out when times get hard You need to establish a connection like no other something that neither of you could live without Becoming fast friends is all about giving her a sense of trust If she trusts you shell be more likely to give you chance when it comes to love   Open up Tell her about yourself your dreams wishes and sorrows Its possible for love to grow where there previously wasnt any but she has to think of you as a person with real goals successes and problems instead of just a friend The more shes able to see parts of you that others dont see the better off youll be Make the person feel special Let her know that she is someones friend  your friend  and that you value her in a unique way Compliment her for her company and for being there when you needed her times when you felt sad and all alone Show appreciation for the comfort the person offers you and for making you smile Always dream with her build with her and always cheer her on and encourage her  Before you two get too close and pass the I love you as a friend line or become too much of a brotherly figure you need to give her hints that you might like her more than as a friend Simple harmless flirts comments something that would make her tell you that youre sweet but also make her think a moment longer about the comment and wonder if there is another deeper meaning to it all   This is very tough to do with words because you dont want to make her think youre friends just in order to get in a relationship In the beginning stick to flirting with your body Dont pass up that chance to sit shouldertoshoulder with her Look her in the eye and smile a lot If youre really comfortable with her try tickling her on her sides or under her arms or giving her a piggyback ride Gradually move on to flirting with words Tell her how much you admire her Tell her how special she is to you Tell her she makes your day easier to get through But remember a little hinting goes a long long way If youre gushing to her every twenty minutes she could begin to feel uncomfortable as friends and start to distance herself from you   Be someone whom they can always turn to for reliable advice If youre there when times get rough and help her through them shell look at you like a problemsolver and trust you more Youll also be someone she feels safe and secure around   When you notice hints coming from her end you know youre getting somewhere But if your hints havent really gotten through to her try a bit harder Being more obvious can be helpful because some girls are used to being flirted with a lot   Get her oneonone This ones important If you never see her when its just the two of you work toward that goal The trick is to make it not look like a date when you ask her but feel like a date when she gets there Tell her youre in Starbucks studying and you want an awesome girl to distract you from your work instead of Hey do you wanna get coffee later on just you and me Make her a mixtape of your favorite music The music you listen to shows her a whole other side of you it helps her to understand you better It also sends her a subtle message that you enjoy sharing personal things with her Be sure to include music that you think she might like You could be setting yourself up for a fall if she only listens to Beethoven and you give her Metallica After you give her your mix ask her to make one for you   Backing off is important because it lets her know what shes missing when she doesnt see you It should force her to think about all the ways you make her life fuller richer more enjoyable Shell be eager to see you in no time   When youre sure that you are getting somewhere back off a little If you see her everyday avoid her for two days or so no contact She will end up missing you and really understanding how deeply she feels for you But make sure you have a valid reason for being away when she asks You dont want to be caught in a lie or look like youre avoiding her on purpose If you think it might work try hanging out with another girl for a day just to pique her interest Girls are attracted to men who get along with lots of attentive women The goal here isnt to make her super jealous The goal is to make her think that girls like being around you and that you have lots of different options when it comes to women   Dont worry about what friends say she feels about you because as we all know information can get distorted Its like a game of telephone She tells something to her other friend who tells it to a completely different friend who gossips to her acquaintance and pretty soon the message has changed completely from what it originally was Tune out any noise that isnt coming directly from her   Be persistent and continue to do fun things with her Studies show that doing something exciting daring or adventurous together helps release a chemical called norepinephrine in her body and yours that is associated with romantic feelings So dont listen to what her friends or your friends say and bring her to Six Flags that haunted house or an exciting game â anything that might cause her to jump scream or wriggle with excitement   Remember only do this if youre okay with the possibility of losing a friend it can get very awkward and uncomfortable if she knows that you want a relationship and she doesnt feel the same way about you Because what youre doing is risking a friendship to get a relationship Some girls will be mad at you for doing this You might not be friends after you tell her  If you are sure you need to tell her Be honest with her and explain your feelings You can say something like Ive really valued our friendship these past couple months and have grown to see how special of a person you are and how alive you make me feel inside I value our friendship over everything but I really like you I cant hide my feelings for you anymore Would you go on a date with me Give her an out Let her know that its okay if she doesnt feel the same way and that you can take it You want her honest opinion not her sugarcoated idea of what you want her to say If you give her an out by saying I know you may not feel the same way about me and I respect that it could go a long way to saving the friendship if she doesnt want to pursue a relationship And if she does want a relationship it will reinforce to her how sweet and respectful you are when it comes to her Dont get too emotional Whatever you do dont break down Emotions are powerful things and she might think that youre using your emotions to manipulate her causing her to distance herself from the situation If you get emotional shell tend to pity you and revert back to the friendzone that you want to try to get away from Stay stoic even if youre boiling up inside Smile at her regardless of what she says and be as happy as possible
Taking good care of yourself is essential for your overall well being As an added bonus she may be attracted to you more if she sees that you are a healthy person Make sure that you are taking care of your basic needs such as diet exercise and sleep before you go looking for love If you are not in good health take some time to improve your situation before you try to get this girl to notice youImprove your eating habits such as by reducing fat and sugar or eating more fruits and vegetables Incorporate 30 minutes of moderate physical activity into your daily routine Sleep for about 8 hours every night Try meditation yoga or deep breathing exercises to help you relax   In addition to tending to your health you should also be giving plenty of attention to your looks Looking your best whenever you run into this girl will make it more likely that she will take notice Try to make grooming and dressing well a part of your daily routineShower and shave or groom your facial hair every day Get a haircut if you have not had one lately Buy yourself some new clothes Wear nice smelling cologne and deodorant   By keeping busy and active in your own life you will show this girl that you are independent and that you have a great life It will also prevent you from becoming too focused on her which can be unhealthy Keep your commitments and make plans with your friends often If the girl asks to see you be honest about your schedule and donât cancel plans just to spend time with her A girl may be more likely to find you desirable if she has to work for your affection That does not mean that you need to start ignoring the girl you like but she may take more interest in you if you also seem a bit uninterested For example you could greet her the same way that you greet the rest of your friends and avoid giving her any special treatment or compliments
The first step to litter training is watching your guinea pig Most guinea pigs have a certain area of their cage where they eliminate If you set up a guinea pigs litter box in this space its more likely to use the boxWatch your guinea pig for a few days Take note of where it tends to eliminate You can also pay attention when youre cleaning the cage You may notice a lot of droppings and urine in one area of the cage  You can buy a litter box online or make one yourself Make sure the litter box is easy for your guinea pig to get in and out of Place it in the corner of the cage where your guinea pig usually eliminatesMake sure the box you choose is large enough that the guinea pig can fit its entire body in the box Make sure the sides are low enough The guinea pig should be able to climb in and out of the box with ease   Go for organic paperbased litters Wood litters can sometimes cause respiratory problems You can find guinea pig litter online or purchase some at a local pet storeIf you cant find a litter box that works for you you can always place litter in the corner of the box   Some guinea pigs have more than one corner where they eliminate If this is the case they are less likely to start using a single litter box If your guinea pig eliminates in more than one corner set up a box in each corner the guinea pig tends to use For the most part litter training is fairly hands off Some guinea pigs will take to the litter box and others will not When starting out try to see if the guinea pig approaches the litter box on its ownMany guinea pigs will realize theyre supposed to eliminate in the box With luck your guinea pig will take to its litter box right away   If your guinea pig is unsure of the box place a small amount of hay in the box The guinea pig may be enticed to enter the box by the hay If it smells any lingering feces or urine it may then realize its supposed to eliminate in the boxSome people advocate leaving food in the box The guinea pig will eat and then eliminate This method is only likely to work if youve seen your guinea pig defecate or urinate near its litter box before Many guinea pigs will not eliminate near a food source to avoid contamination If your guinea pig starts using its box change the litter regularly Try to change it about every three days A guinea pig will not eliminate in a dirty litter boxOnly wash the box every other week You want some of the scent to remain intact so the guinea pig knows to use its litter box   Clumping cat litter can be dangerous for guinea pigs Guinea pigs may eat clumping cat litter and can choke on it Clumping cat litter also contains chemicals meant to reduce scent which can be toxic to a guinea pigIt may be a good idea to ask your vet about safe litters before choosing a litter for your guinea pig   Never scold a guinea pig for failing to use its litter box Your guinea pig is unlikely to understand why it is being scolded Scolding will not encourage your guinea pig to use its litter box It will only create stressYou should also avoid other forms of punishment especially physical punishment You should never hit your pet   Not all guinea pigs take to a litter box As guinea pigs are less domesticated than other household pets theyre difficult to train Despite your best efforts a guinea pig may never learn to use its litter box Do not try to force a guinea pig to use a litter box if it seems unwillingIf your guinea pig does not tend to eliminate in a single corner it is less likely to use its litter box
When you really care for someone it can be easy ignore the signals that they do not feel the same way The longer you ignore these however the longer you will draw out your rejection and heartacheSome indicators include   She wont make time for you She doesnt return your textscalls She never reaches out to you to make plans She says she likes you as a friend Shes not interested in physical affection She has told you that shes not in love with you  Whether youve noticed a series of signs or the girl has straight up told you that she doesnt have feelings for you you need to do some work to accept that it is true The heart wants what it wants and it can very rarely be swayed otherwise Dont imagine that you will change her mind Take her at her word and accept that its overIt can be helpful to say it out loud to yourself or a friend You might say My relationship with Katie is over Katie doesnt love me   When you experience rejection you are likely to feel a range of emotions including disbelief anger and sadness Do whatever you need to do to feel these feelings and to process themCry if you feel like crying Talk to your friends Write in a journal Comfort yourself with things you like such as ice cream hot baths or movies   In order for you to heal you need space If you love a girl and she doesnt love you you cant just go on pretending to be friends Youre not friends she is the girl you love So until you have truly moved on from this heartbreak you need to avoid any unnecessary contact with herConsider deleting her number from your phone to avoid callingtexting her Stay away from places you know she is likely to be This may mean missing out on certain parties or social gatherings but its worth it If you absolutely must see her for instance if you work together keep your interactions brief and professional   In the modern era we have our friends at the touch of a button Unfortunately this means you have images of the girlwhodoesntloveyou at the touch of a button too Although it is tempting avoid visiting her pages on social media Perhaps even consider blocking her at least temporarily You need the space to heal and you cant do that if you are cyberstalking her every moveIn order to avoid her online presence you may want to   Spend less time on social media Unfollow her on social media sites Avoid visiting the pages of mutual friends If you happen to come across her quickly put your phone away or close your laptop and walk away Dont let yourself get sucked in   If you know that this girl doesnt love you do not allow her to turn to you for emotional support or physical contact Although this may be very tempting it is only going to cause you pain If she reaches out to you you must find the fortitude to declineYou really shouldnt be communicating with her anyway If she reaches out to you simply tell her I need to take a little space for myself right now I dont think we should be spending time together   Once you accept that she doesnt love you you may move through sadness and into anger You may want to lash out or even seek some sort of revenge towards either the girl or somebody new that she is dating It is perfectly natural to have these thoughts but its not okay to act on them Seeking vengeance will not make her love you it wont feel as good as you think and you could get into trouble Instead allow these thoughts to come and go so that you can move onYou should also resist the urge to talk badly about her to mutual friends It will only make you look catty In the beginning you might vent to a couple of close trusted friends Then try not to talk about her anymore   In order for you to move on you need something positive to overshadow the negative Try to have some fun Hang out with friends and go dancing Spend an evening doing karaoke or travel someplace new Even if you dont feel like having fun force yourself to get out there and try It will probably be better than you think You cant control who she loves The only thing you have control over is yourself Now is a great time to focus on some form of selfimprovement Have you always wanted to play the guitar workout more or excel in school Now is an excellent time to put your focus on a new goal Unfortunately there is no magic pill you can take to get rid of your heartbreak Instead this process is going to take time And even after a long string of good days a bad day might sneak up on you Thats normal Just remember that this is a process and you are healing a little bit every day
This will help you to figure out what you want him to notice about you Maybe you like how smart you are or youâre proud of the way your treat people or you appreciate your creativity Figure out these things for yourself You donât have to wait for him to tell you that youâre awesome Instead you have a chance to share with him the wonderful things about you whether he appreciates them or notIf you arenât sure try making a list of at least three things that you appreciate about yourself It can include anything at all If you are struggling ask a good friend or family member to help you Sometimes seeing yourself through the eyes of those who love you can be quite illuminating  Before he can see whatâs on the inside initially he can only see your outer appearance Take advantage of this to express yourself and make a statement about who you are This can be accomplished by developing your own sense of style The way people dress says a lot about them Someone in sweatpants has a very different demeanor than someone in a dress You certainly donât have to wear a dress unless you want to but find a style that feels true to you This way even whatâs on the outside will be able to tell him something about whatâs on the insideIf you donât know where to start look at the styles of other people around you and think about what they are communicating through what they wear If you find someone wearing something that you like make a mental note of it To develop your own style go to a few stores and start trying on clothes Step outside of your comfort zone and try new styles For feedback you can bring along a friend Once you try on a bunch of clothes you should have a better idea of what works for you You could even take pictures of your top three outfits Make sure that you feel comfortable and confident and keep in mind what you are communicating   When you respect yourself physically mentally and emotionally you will naturally be more attractive and vibrant This means eating well getting enough sleep exercising and staying hydrated but it also means monitoring negative thought patterns validating your emotions and surrounding yourself with people who bring out the best in you When you take time to respect all aspects of yourself you teach others to do the same and people will instinctively take notice of thisIt can take a lifetime to truly master this but donât let that deter you Aim for progress not perfection Start with one change you can make today Maybe you usually eat junk food for dinner You can easily replace this with a healthy salad and some grilled fish If are very hard on yourself and you catch yourself being negative replace this with a word of encouragement such as âYou did a great job writing your paper todayâ Perhaps you have a friend who always seems to cause conflict and trouble Try spending less time with this friend and more time with someone who treats people well   When you know your own worth he will naturally take notice Take ownership of what you think and how you feel and donât be afraid to communicate this Youâre the only one who can share this with the world and you have a worthwhile unique perspective to contribute If you have been afraid to share your thoughts and feelings in the past start with something small For example if your friends ask where you want to eat and you would usually just say âI donât care What sounds good to youâ try replacing that with something you want such as âMexican food sounds great right nowâ Practicing speaking up for yourself to develop confidence This will allow you to share your true self with the guy you likeTo cultivate confidence spend time pursuing your interests and growing your talents When youâre doing what youâre good at you will feel more confident Even if youâre not feeling particularly confident you can fake it âtil you make it Present yourself well by using confident body language Stand tall with your shoulders back and make eye contact with people You will instantly appear more confident regardless of how you feel   This will help you to be wellbalanced so that there isnât too much riding on whether or not he notices you Plus when you are in your element doing what you love you are more likely to catch his attention anyway Maybe you love playing an instrument or excel at a sport Pursue these passions so that you grow as a personIf you arenât sure what makes you happy pick an activity that interests you and give it a try Donât worry if youâre a complete beginner Maybe youâve thought that painting looks fun but you havenât had the chance to try it Simply buy some paper paint and a paintbrush and get going Look for tips online or sign up for a class Maybe youre happiest when you spend time with your friends Being around loved ones and building strong relationships is a great way to improve your happiness Make sure to invest time in the people you love It can be very rewarding to give to people and help others If you arent sure what makes you happy try volunteering somewhere You could spend some time reading to seniors at a retirement home or spend time giving out food to the poor When you see how you positively impact others you will feel happy too   This is the first step in forging a connection It signals your interest and is sure to get his attention Guys are much more likely to notice girls that show their interest in this way To start try to catch his glance and then maintain eye contact for a couple of seconds while smiling This shows that you are friendly and available and will make you much more approachable Donât be surprised if he strikes up a conversation with you This is a great way to casually signal interest Follow him on your social media accounts You could even send him a casual message like Hey it was great seeing you at the game todayâ People also often tell a lot about themselves over social media so this is a good way to learn more about him Knowing about his interests is a great way to strike up a conversation with him the next time you see him This will help you to relate to him Even if you donât have much in common you can probably find some common ground If you dont know very much about him simply ask him a question to find out more such as âHow long have you been swimming forâ This shows your interest and starts a conversation with a subject that he is interested in He is sure to enjoy and notice this Most people like talking about themselves This is a good way to âaccidentallyâ run into him Maybe he plays in a band each weekend or maybe he has a sporting event every Wednesday Grab a few of your friends and go to one of these When he sees you there he will be likely to notice you because you are sharing an activity   Guys tend to like girls who like them You donât have to overdo it but just tell him something that you like about himFor example if you are at his football game you could go up to him afterwards and say something like âYou played great today I enjoyed watching your gameâ This will make him feel good and allow him to see that you appreciate him It is also a good way to start a conversation with him This will help him to notice you as more than just a friend There are many ways to flirt so choose the ways that feel natural to you Try gently touching his arm while you are talking Physical contact has been shown to be a powerful way to get someoneâs attention Just donât overdo it If you come on too strong you might scare him off Happy people tend to be more noticeable They stand out Show off your sense of humor and laugh at his jokes This will allow you to show your beautiful smile as well Try to make him laugh too Use a goofy pun or tell him a silly joke If he tells you that youâre a good listener say something like âIâm sorry I canât hear youâ If he feels happy around you he will surely take notice of that If youâre doing your best to allow him to notice you but he still isnât getting the hint you can always speed things up a bit and simply tell him how you feel If youâre not very comfortable confessing your feelings to him you can do so more casually by saying something such as âIâve had so much fun hanging out with you lately I really like spending time with youâ You can then see how he responds Maybe he feels the same way but wasnât sure how to bring it up A girl can only wait so long If he still isnât noticing you try making the move yourself If you feel confident asking him out on a date go for it If youâre not ready to formally ask him out you could try something more easygoing by saying something like âA few of my friends are going to see a movie this weekend Would you like to join usâ This takes the pressure off yet still allows a chance for you to spend more time with him If he agrees to go make the most of it and try to show your interest and get to know him better If you go through these steps and he still isnât taking notice itâs time to move on There are plenty of other guys out there Make sure you are content regardless of who notices you Your happiness is your responsibility When you are happy and confident even if the guy you like doesnât notice you the right person will somedayA good way to practice contentment is to count your blessings It can be challenging when you dont get what you want but you still have a lot of other great things and people in your life Make the most of what you have right now instead of waiting for something in the future Then when you finally do find the right person you will be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it If you are struggling with this try making a list of all the great people and things in your life Instead of dwelling on the one person who doesnt notice you take notice of each person who cherishes you and spend time with them They will help you get past your disappointment Try to practice positive thinking instead of allowing negativity to cloud your mind Replace thoughts like I feel awful that he doesnt like me Why does this always happen to me Im never going to find someone with I have such an amazing friend who does notice me Im so fortunate for what I have We always have a great time together This will help you to appreciate what you have instead of dwelling on what you dont have

You dont want to give guinea pigs the full run of the house because there are too many hazards In addition guinea pigs can get lost in the shuffle or be scared by loud noisesConsider picking a single room that doesnt have too many places for the guinea pig to hide A hallway or bathroom works well Places like the kitchen have too many places for the guinea pigs to hide or squeeze into Also remember that guinea pigs like to chew If you love the furniture in a particular room you may not want to put your guinea pigs in there Another option is to use a wire pen or cage that you set up in a room   Guinea pigs are happy to chew on electrical cords if you give them the chance Make sure any cords are up out of reach of the guinea pigs or that you pick a room that doesnt have them near the floor Move any plants and other hazards out of reach Plastic bags for instance can pose a suffocation hazard Make sure to also pick up any dead leaves as many houseplants are poisonous to guinea pigs If you have larger animals in your home they should not be in the same room as the guinea pigs when they are out They could attack or injure the guinea pigs by just following their instincts That way they wont rush into the room without checking to see where the guinea pigs are In addition if guinea pigs are underfoot without the familys knowledge they could easily be stepped onYou could use a note or sign on the door to help family members remember This step also warns your family not to let other pets in   Try to provide at least 3 hours outside of the cage a day if the guinea pigs are in a cage that isnt large enough for themThat means that if your guinea pig has less than 75 square feet you need to provide this time out of the cage every day Otherwise your guinea pig could get bored   If you let your guinea pigs out of their cage for extended periods dont forget they still need food and water If they cant go back to their cage make sure you have food and water out for them
Most guys are taught that they dont need to be respectful to women and act accordingly Dont be one of those guys Being respectful does not mean being a doormat or being whipped but it does mean treating the girl you as if shes an actual human being which surprisingly enough she is   One way of showing respect is to stop doing something when she tells you to stop For example if you two were having a tickle war and she says Stop it you stop even if you think shes kidding If she is kidding shell let you know and you can continue Showing that you respect her right to say no in minor instances will show that you are willing to respect her boundaries in more important instances Be respectful to other people when youre around her and in general Dont talk about your ex as that weirdo or use language like that Dont degrade women or call guys pussies Youll come across as disrespectful to women and youll come across as immature   While a lot of guys say that womens body language is a mystery its really not that hard Remember you can tell when your sister is upset with you or your female friend is trying to ignore you The girl you like isnt going to be any different to understandIf she spends most of her time not making eye contact with you or giving you short one word answers she either doesnt want to be around you or shes upset with you Its probably best to back off A girl who wants you to stick around is going to be pretty obvious about it Shell be turned towards you Shell be making eye contact and smiling and laughing at the things you say not derisively She may even touch you like on the arm when shes making a point   It turns out that making eye contact is one of the biggest ways to flirt with someone that youre interested in This is a good one that you can use in class if youre sitting in the right spot or even across the room if youre at a partyYou can do this a couple different ways A good way to do this is to make eye contact if shes across the room catch her eye and hold it Now if the two of you are having a conversation make sure to look deeply into her eyes For some reason that intense long look can cause butterflies in the other person Smile when youre looking at her especially as youre making eye contact A little smirk can be even better than a giant grin   A girls friends are incredibly important to her She will listen to their opinions even if she wont always follow their advice If they dont like you it will cast a niggling bit of doubt in her own mind about you To keep that from happening you need to make sure that her friends like you   Learn some of the things that they like and ask them questions about those interests For example if her friends are super into a tv show ask them a little about it whats their favorite thing about the show favorite characters favorite episodes things that irritate them about the show or the fandom If youre having a conversation with the girl you like and her friends are around make sure to include them in the conversation You can still give her the long heartfelt languishing looks while making sure that her friends dont feel like youre ignoring them completely Dont flirt with her friends however You dont want to come across as a player who is out to get whichever girl responds to his attentions The girl you like wont think youre interested in her if youre flirting with all her friends too
The people who know your relationship best likely spend the most time with you and your boyfriend Perhaps they have noticed a change in his behavior or seen some activity that would confirm his infidelity Since they know you well they are likely to empathize with you too if they have something to shareItâs hard to broach this difficult topic but you could try by saying âI believe Mark is cheating on me I trust you and wanted to know if you have seen or heard anything to support thatâ By letting the person know what esteem you hold them in they will be more likely to help you if they can Try to control your temper when seeking out information from trusted people to confirm the infidelity They are more likely to clam up if they feel accused or somehow complicit in the cheating  In todayâs modern age itâs very difficult to carry on an affair with no paper trail particularly an electronic one Begin investigating your boyfriendâs public communication channels to confirm that he is cheating   Check out his social media pages Are there any unusual posts on Facebook Twitter or Instagram Keep an ear out for any odd phone calls he makes or receives   A disruption of longstanding patterns could be a sign your boyfriend cheating Is he a morning person who has suddenly turned into a night owl Think about all the facets of your life together that have recently undergone large changes you canât explain   If your boyfriend is keeping very different hours than he typically does that is something of note Is he constantly running late lately when he is usually very punctual Observe your home life Are you two people who rarely fight who are now fighting all the time Think about when any changes in established patterns began and how long they have been going on Can they be explained another way such as a large project as work If not they could be meaningful Physical intimacy is an important part of a relationship If youâre normally intimate frequently but you havenât had sex in months there could be someone else in the picture   Do this only if you have found evidence of cheating Many people even cheaters feel an overwhelming sense of guilt about their behavior If you think you know who your boyfriend is cheating with it can he helpful to talk to them before confronting your boyfriend They may feel they owe you some information for having disrupted your relationshipIf you go this route stay calm when talking to them The person you should be mad at is your boyfriend who had a commitment to you rather than this outsider Itâs even possible they did not know he was in a relationship You are only talking with them to find out further details This can be a controversial approach and so is best undertaken only if you feel calm and comfortable in this conversation Approach the other person only if you have clear evidence Itâs best to connect in person or on the phone so they have to contend with the fact that you are a real person Theyâre likely to ignore a message You could call and say âYou may not know this but Mark and I are in a relationship I believe youâre having a relationship with him as well I wanted to talk to you about itâ Donât confront your boyfriend on his lunch break or right before you need to sleep at night You will need adequate time to talk about what has happened Try to find a time when he is not busy with other tasks or make time on his calendar if necessary   You could say âDo you have a good time today or tomorrow for us to talk about something importantâ He will likely make time right then and there Trust your instincts and try not to back out once youve set your time Remain centered and calm yourself through deep breathing   Confronting your boyfriend about something as loaded as cheating may feel very stressful You may be angry or depressed Before talking with him take a few deep breaths or talk on the phone with a friend to calm yourselfBeing overly stressed may cause you to attack him which will make him defensive The goal of confronting him is to let him know you know and find out any relevant details that have not been revealed   If you are certain he is cheating you could say âI have evidence that you are cheating on meâ This is more difficult for him to deny than your asking âAre you cheating on meâ If you are pretty sure heâs cheating but not 100 you could say âI believe you are cheating on meâ This feels more declarative and firm than âI thinkâ Pause and let him respond It is his job to explain himselfIf he denies an affair present evidence that proves heâs lying if you have it If you do not have firm evidence you will need to make a difficult decision about whether you can trust him to be truthful about this or not Gather all the information you feel you need to make a decision about the future of the relationship Good questions might include âHow long has this been going onâ âAre you in love with herâ and âWhat does this mean for you and meâ   He may have cheated because he wanted to break up but was too cowardly or he may be desperately seeking forgiveness for this terrible decision Either way itâs important to understand whether your boyfriend has a desire to proceed with the relationship or not   If he wants to stay together that doesnât mean you need to want that too If you find you do want to move forward though youâll need to understand if you have a willing partner or not   Does what you learned about his cheating make you want to move forward with him Donât make a decision in the heat of the moment If he presses you for a snap decision buy yourself some time You could say âIâm not ready to make that decision right now I need some time to thinkâTalking long walks or talking with friends are great ways to work through your feelings   If you do not wish to move forward with the relationship you will need to break up with your boyfriend Find a good time to talk in person You do not need to provide an elaborate explanation or justify how you feel You can simply end things respectfully   For example you might say âIâve thought this over and because you cheated on me I donât want to be in a relationship with you anymoreâ Deliver your news in a calm way Try not to be vindictive even if youâre hurt Just because you were not treated well by your boyfriend does not mean you need to stoop to his level If your boyfriend has violent tendencies be sure to let a friend or relative know where you will be breaking up and when It can also help to break up in a public place with other people around You could say something to them like âIâm breaking up with Mark today at 3PM in the park If Iâm not home by 4PM please call the policeâ After your relationship ends you may be full of mixed emotions Take some time to focus on yourself and restore your selfesteem It may be helpful to reconnect with people and activities you enjoy that fell by the wayside during your relationshipFor example if you used to love painting you might join a neighborhood painting class The idea is just to connect with yourself as an individual rather than as part of your old couple It is helpful to take all the time you need to heal before entering into a new relationship Take the time you need to strengthen your friendships and relationship with family and learn to take care of yourself before you start a new relationship   If you decide you want to work through the cheating and continue with the relationship it will be important to tell your boyfriend what he needs to do to gain your trust back Make a list of all the concrete actions he can take to begin repairing some of the damage heâs doneFor example if the person he cheated with is someone you both know you may need him to stop seeing them even as a friend Or letâs say your boyfriendâs cheating got started through late night drinking Maybe he will need to come home by a given time for a month to begin making you feel as though you can trust him again   Your boyfriend should understand that you might need more communication from him than usual to start building trust again It can be helpful to have predetermined checkins when you are apart so you donât start to get worried   You could say to him âI know youâre going out with your friends tonight Can you text me after dinner and then again when youâre getting in the cab home so I know what to expectâ Telling one another how you are feeling as you work through the aftermath of this affair will keep you connected It will also enable him to act in a way that is considerate of your emotions going forwardIf a disagreement about getting married spurred the cheating for example you should make an effort to discuss that part of your relationship You might say âI understand that you felt unwanted when I rebuffed your proposal I love you very much and I do want to marry you one day I just need to go slow right now thoughâ   Setting new relationship ground rules helps build trust that your boyfriend will do what he says he is going to do This is especially critical as he is telling you he wants to recommit to the relationship Now more than ever he needs to prove that he will follow through on his

If she knows that the Warriors are your favorite basketball team and has suddenly started talking to you about them then she may have picked up a new love for the team just because of you If she knows you love watching Game of Thrones and suddenly knows everything about the characters then she may just be trying to impress you with these new interests   If shes never shown an interest in your interests before but suddenly seems to know everything about the things you like then she probably likes you   If she approaches you and asks a question that you know she can easily get answered by someone else like how hard the math test was or what new sport you played in gym class then shes clearly just looking for an excuse to talk to you If she asks what you think of a certain teacher or the new kid in school shes just trying to spend more time with you by asking any question that comes to her mind   If the girl teases you then its almost definitely true that she likes you If she makes fun of you from laughing at your shoes giggling at your new outfit or makes a comment about how messy your locker is then shes just teasing you because she likes to be around you Sometimes her teasing can even get a little mean but that doesnt mean she doesnt like you   Just remember the golden rule if shes paying attention to you she likes you Teasing is just one way of paying attention   In middle school teasing and flirting are almost interchangeable Still there are some signs that the girl is flirting with you If she winks at you even jokingly shes definitely flirting If she teases you about your new haircut and maybe even says its an improvement then shes flirting with you   If she acts coy playful or just a little bit silly around you then shes flirting with you If she makes fun of you for liking another girl especially when you clearly dont like another girl then shes just flirting with you   If the girl is suddenly interested in who you like and if you want to ask any girl out then she wants to know if you like her  unless shes playing matchmaker for one of her friends If shes always bugging you about who you like or even throws out some names of people she knows you dont really like then shes just trying to talk to you about your romantic life to get close to you   If she makes fun of any girlfriends youve had in the past or just makes fun of other girls around you then shes probably just jealous because she really likes you   Middle school girls love flirting over Facebook and texting Remember the first rule if she pays attention to you then theres a good chance she likes you If shes always texting you or posting on your Facebook wall for no reason then she probably likes you   If she posts a video or a link to something you like on your Facebook wall then its even more likely that she likes you If she asks what youre doing over the weekend when she texts you then shes interested in you plans because she likes you Check out her Facebook activity Does she talk to other guys on Facebook as often as she talks to you or are you special
Donât overthink it and try to be too deep or clever Just show her that find her interesting enough to talk to Start the same sort of conversation that you would with anybody else Use whatever situation that you find yourself in to pick a starting point For instance you couldRequest a small favor like âHey could you show me your laptop Iâm looking for a new oneâ or âWhat just happened onscreen I looked away for one second and missed itâ Ask her about something relevant For example âWhat did you think of that band that just playedâ or âI like those patches on your bag Whereâd you get themâ Make a simple comment about whatever like âI donât know about you but I think Iâm freezing in hereâ or âThat had to be the most ridiculous fight Iâve ever seenâ  Being a good listener is important in relationships Active listening can help you to grasp more of what someone is saying while also making the person feel like you are listening closely Try to practice active listening whenever she is talking Some things you can do includeMaking eye contact and facing her Donât look at your phone or glance around the room when she is talking Nodding and making neutral statements such as âyesâ âuhhuhâ âI seeâ and âgo onâ Asking probing questions to keep her talking and show interest such as âWhat happened nextâ âHow did you feelâ and âWhat are you going to do nowâ Clarifying what she says when necessary such as by saying It seems like you are saying ____ Is that right Or What do you mean when you say ____   Once the conversation gets rolling let her steer it Respond to what she says Follow up with questions to learn more about her Show her that you are genuinely interested in herWhen she tells a story ask her what happened next Or back up and ask for a little more backstory to this or that plot point When she shares an opinion ask her what led her to form that opinion Share your own stories and opinions but be sure to tie them back to what she last said For example if she was talking about how sheâs scared of the ocean donât brag about that time you successfully fought off a great white shark Instead use that story to show that you understand her fright   Donât try to pretend to be to the person that you think she wants Donât adopt your friendsâ tactics either if they go against your own personality Remember just because one tactic works for one person doesnât mean it will work for you Instead impress her with who you really areDonât make her feel tricked later on   Donât fake interest in stuff that you couldnât care less about For instance donât pretend to love football just because youâre at a Super Bowl party If you arenât ready to share this or that part of yourself just yet leave it unmentioned For example if you feel embarrassed about writing poetry donât tell her that you think poetry is stupid   Donât take âintimacyâ to mean âromanceâ Instead simply try to forge a connection that she canât replicate with someone else Make her feel special by building a private language between the two of you Use elements from your surroundings and your conversation For example Try âFuriosaâ if she loves cars shaves her head or drives aggressively Call her âSlickâ if she trips But make sure she finds it funny and quit it if she doesnât   Poke fun at your surroundings other people or even yourselvesFor example say you both met someone whose name sounds like an action heroâs name In the future whenever the two of you have a flat tire or get lost cry âJack Gunner please save usâ   Make an act of sharing a âsecretâ with her even though itâs not something that you really hide Again say youâre at a Super Bowl party but hate football Make a show of hushing your voice and whispering your confession Make her feel as though the two of you share something special even though you both know itâs a joke
The worst thing is undoing all the straps and buckles only to find that you have run out of leather ointment or saddle soap and having to wait until you get some more The best products are beeswax products they help to keep the moisture in while making the leather clean and waterproof There are many other good cleaning products available for use such as Neats Foot Oil Theather Dressing Saddle Soap etc There are also products made by saddle and bridle companies to be used with their gear such as Wintecs Saddle Cleaner As this is a synthetic saddle the cleaner should be a nonwater mix and be a wipe on wipe off product You also need to make sure you have some equipment to help you while cleaning These include   A Hoof Pick Often bridles have buckles and holes that require some tempting You can use a hoof pick as it is easy to hold and isnt going to mark your leather Tooth Picks Use these to get dirt and muck out of holes as well as pushing cleaning products through holes on throat latch and nose band as they may become clogged with wax Towels or Cloths Its best to have a separate towel for the first cleaning to remove dirt and grass buildup a second one for the oiling a third for wiping the oil and wax off and a fourth for polishing and shining the leather You dont need to have 4 but it is recommended you have more than one or two Newspaper If youre inside newspaper is essential so you dont get oil and wax on the kitchen table or on the floor as they can become slippery and may stain the furniture It is best to clean outside as the smells may cause asthma and breathing difficulties A Bucket and Warm Water  To clean and rinse bits and chains  For the purpose of this article a bridle will be used   Once undone you cant go back A good idea is to draw a picture of what it looks like or even better take some photos so its easier to remember where each piece should go You can also use another bridle as an example Remember though straps and buckles leave an indent so this is a good way to put the bridle back to the right size   Dont add any detergent as they contain products that are not good for horses We will come back to the bit after the oiling is finished This time is available for soaking   If the bridle has stains or marks keep these in mind and you can fix these later You can also use some saddle soap to clean the leather   It is beneficial to use the oil generously so it will soak in You can oil each piece and let sit while you begin on other pieces Then when you get back to the first piece it will have soaked in enough Make sure you apply liberal amounts of oil and wax to any parts that are prone to wearing such as loops buckles and holes   Make sure you get inside any holes and loops   The friction will help make it shiny   And place all pieces in a logical order in preparation for putting it back together   Toothpaste is noncorrosive and doesnt harm your horse while giving a nice shine to your bit You dont want to remove the taste however as after years of riding a bit will feel natural in a horses mouth due to the taste and smoothness Clean the bit all over making sure you scrub around grooves and joints   You can also rub it down to hurry up the process   Assistance may be required if you get stuck so refer back to pictures and diagrams If back together and it doesnt look right undo and try again When its on the horse you will be able to get a better picture Dont forget the bit too   To fix these get a permanent marker the same colour as your leather If you have a tan or brown bridle you can get coloured beeswax which is used for cleaning sandshoes Use the permanent marker by dabbing with the point until the mark is black Because the leather is oiled the mark will be less noticeable Use a small amount of oil in your fingertips to rub over the marks when dried of course to keep the colour from rubbing off

Asking her friends is she likes you is a less bold way of basically telling her that youre interested in her yourself Still if youre feeling shy but really want to know how she feels without asking her directly then just ask her friends how she feels about you They probably wont tell you how she feels but theyll make it obvious that she likes you by acting excited and saying that you should talk to her Theyll also tell her that you like her right away so be careful   Her friends will however let you know if the girl doesnt like you and this will spare your feelings if she doesnt   If youre feeling brave and really want to date this girl then just find a time when youre alone together like by your lockers after school and ask her how she really feels about you You can even admit that you like her first if you do and wait for her to respond Dont put too much pressure on her  just casually say that youve noticed that she might like you and that you want to know how she feels   You can even complement her a bit to put her at ease   If she admits that she likes you and you like her too you dont have to jump up and down for joy or youll look uncool Instead just show her that youre excited that you both like each other and ask her if she wants to hang out some time If she doesnt like you dont be a jerk about it Just say Cool its no big deal and act cool and calm as you say goodbye This will show her that youre comfortable with yourself and who knows  maybe shell change her mind about you in the future   Whatever happens remember that youre in middle school Relationships in middle school are fun but theyre usually short and shouldnt be taken too seriously Just try to have fun and if it doesnt work out with this girl someone else will definitely fall for you
You might be aware of your parents rule but not fully aware of the reasons for why your parents have this rule Understanding why your parents have created this rule will help you explore your feelings as well as communicate to your guy why you cannot dateParents create such rules because they are worried about your safety and wellbeing They do not want to see you with a broken heart or they might be worried about you being sexually active Or perhaps they think dating will distract you from focusing on your schoolwork  Listen to your parents reasons without interrupting them Acknowledge their concerns and tell them that you want to be safe tooIf your parents are worried about you being sexually active show them that you are informed about safer sex You can say âI appreciate your concerns mom and dad But a nurse from Planned Parenthood gave a talk at school about safer sex last month Here are the pamphlets she gave us I am well informed about issues of consent and how to practice safer sexâ If you are not sexually active and have no desire be sexually active tell them this too For example âI know you are concerned but I am not sexually active and I do not plan on being sexually active any time soon I am just interested in getting to know someone betterâ   If your parents are open to the idea explore compromises that will make them feel more comfortable You could suggest group dates instead of oneonone dates or they may be more open to chaperoned dances Also discuss being home at a certain time or only going on dates with people they have met and know wellIf negotiation is not an option it is ok and common to feel angry andor frustrated At this point you can seek out the advice and help of other adults in your life for example older family members teachers or counselors   If you cannot or your parents will not discuss dating with you seek the help of other adults  for example an older relative or sibling An older adult might have a better understanding of your parentâs perspective and they might be able to explain it to you They may even be able to help you talk with your parents about the issueMake sure you seek out someone you trust   After you have spoken with your parents or a trusted adult take time to analyze your feelings Work out how you feel about the situation and what your needs are By understanding your feelings it will be easier to explain to your guy why you cannot dateFor example you may agree with your parents on some issues but not on other issues Or you might not agree with them at all or fully agree with them The point is to take the time to understand where you stand on the issue It can be difficult sorting out your thoughts and feelings If you need help consult your school counselor or another trusted adult   Before you talk to your guy come up with various explanations that communicate how you feel and why you cannot date in an effective way By not planning out what you will say you might end up saying something you regret or do not meanWrite down different explanations and practice saying the best one in front of the mirror Make sure your tone of voice is confident   When delivering the message make it clear that the issue is not with him but with your age or your parents rules This way you can avoid making him feel rejected or at fault Make your feelings and opinions on the issue clear as wellYou can say âHey John I want to talk about what you asked me the other nightâdating I spoke with my parents and they still think I am too young to date I agree with some of their reasons but at the same time I feel that I am mature enough to date But I do still live under their roof and I have to abide by their rules I hope you understandâ   When confronting him make sure it is an appropriate time You want to choose a time and place that ensures that you are being heard and understood Try to choose a time when you are both relaxed and not preoccupied with something elseIf he is busy with schoolwork sports or is hanging out with his friends choose another time to tell him Avoid bringing up the issue during an intense moment like an argument Also donât use your news as a weapon to gain an advantage or to hurt him   Before he begins to respond to what you have just said make sure he understands what you said first Ask him to repeat or summarize what you just said By doing this you can avoid any miscommunicationFor example âBefore you respond can you summarize what you heard me say so I can be sure that I communicated clearly and that you understood correctlyâ Provide any needed clarification especially if he feels that he is at fault   His agreement with your message should not be an issue At this point your priority is to ensure that you were heard and understood correctly Therefore do not get hooked into apologizing or defending your message Everyone has a different way of coping with something they do not want to hear Therefore he might be confused or angry If he reacts negatively such as anger or inappropriate comments remain calm Donât yell back or return inappropriate comments If he threatens you or makes you feel unsafe stop the conversation and leave immediatelyTry to remember that his reaction might be because he wasnât prepared for the news You might need to reiterate and reinforce the idea that the issue is not with him You can say âI understand that youâre angry But it isnât about you and the decision is not a reflection of you or your actions It is about how my parents and I feel â   If he does not have a problem with what you said and understands your reasons suggest that you guys remain good friends Remaining friends will strengthen and add depth to your friendship If you stay friends long enough your chance to date him might become a reality

After you and a certain girl have spent enough time together there will come a point where you should figure out what it is you want from the connection Are you content with a shortterm interaction or do you think theres the potential for something greater If youre unsure you might bring this subject up with the girl in question Finding out what her thoughts are may give you some clarity   This is helpful if you want to stay in touch and particularly important if you think she may be leading you on Many people will show their relationship statuses online This way you can see if a girl is truly as available as she says she is   Likewise you should expect a girl to look you up online as well This means you should avoid trying to start romance if you are already in a committed relationship with someone back home   This is important to keep in mind going into the romance itself as you shouldnt set yourself up for heartbreak towards the end If anything you should enjoy a romance for the short time it lasts If the chemistry is really strong enough however the two of you may want to take it further   If the chemistry between the two of you is potent enough you should try to keep a connection between the two of you even if theres a major distance Some lifelong romances have occurred in spite of originally living continents apart Ask for her number or email information and take it from there If the two of you manage to foster a longerlasting correspondence you may decide to meet up again later on down the road   Like any romantic encounter there is absolutely nothing to promise that the other person will feel the same way as you do This is possibly especially true in a vacation setting where a more prudent woman will recognize the folly of falling in love on vacation No matter how bad it hurts at first accept it gracefully and go back to enjoying your vacation Dont let a rejection get in the way of the rest of your experience Its quite possible that youll meet another woman on the same trip and thing will turn out for the better   Even if it doesnt pan out and you wanted it to last the experience still leaves a lot to consider When you return from your travels you should take the time to reflect on what happened and how it may have changed your opinions on your daytoday life
If you go into a store that sells tack and horse supplies you can ask an employee and they should help you find the right size Make sure you have precise measurements of your horses head before going in Choose the halter that matches your ponys size There are halters made specifically for horses which are larger and ones made for ponies which are smaller  Do not stand directly in front of the pony This is their blind spot where they are unable to see you and you may scare them Most halters are designed to be put on from the left side of the horse Hold the halter in your left hand and stand on their left side   This will let the pony know you do not plan to hurt him and that the halter isnt bad   Place the lead rope around the neck behind the ears This will keep the pony from turning around or backing up to avoid halter Do not tie or buckle the lead rope around the ponys neck This could cause injury to you or the pony if the pony tried to get away   The crown piece or the strap that would go behind your horses ears should be unbuckled If you are planning to lead the horse right away you can have the lead rope already clipped to the halter Just make sure the lead rope doesnt get in the way   Hold the part of the halter that goes by their ears in your other hand   Settle the nose band on your ponys nose It should not hang down too low and should rest a little lower than midway up the ponys muzzle and rest on the bridge of the nose   Do not pull the ears or bend them too much Buckle the strap by the horses ears Make sure that the buckle on the halter is always facing into the ponys jaw so when you take the halter off you are snapping it open from the inside of the halter next to the ponys head Praise your pony for being cooperative   Never wrap the lead rope around your hand the excess length coil and hold in outside hand while inside hand is holding under halter ring on chin

Dont wait around hoping to hear from him Your life without him should be full and interesting The biggest mistake you can make is to wait for a guy to make your life fun and exciting That gives you way too much time to obsess about your crush and frankly makes you pretty boring Get busy pursuing your own thing and its likely hell be wondering if he can tag along   Showing that you are an interesting independent person all on your own Hell be flattered that youre spending time with him not because you need him to make your life exciting but because you choose to be with him   Dont set yourself up for failure by pretending to be something youre not just to get a guy to like you If he doesnt see through your act immediately it will only be a matter of time before he finds out Being comfortable with yourself projects confidence which is irresistibleIf you hate football but your crush is obsessed with it dont pretend to be a fan If you just dont know much about the sport ask him to share his knowledge If youre into it then youve got another thing in common If youre not thats okay Just be honest If your crush always dates girly girls but youre more of a tomboy dont reinvent yourself just so hell notice you If you can catch his interest because youre interesting and funny youll know hes into you for your personality and not just because you fit his type   Obsessing over whether or not he thinks about you as much as you think about him is draining can hurt your selfesteem and can cause you to feel insecureCrushes are supposed to be fun Focus on living that full interesting life and you wont worry so much about whats going to happen next   Dont let obsessing stop you from doing the things you love and turn you into someone else Keep doing the things that make you you
It pays to be prepared You dont just take a math test without studying or pass a drivers ed test without taking a class The people who put time and thought into winning their crush usually have a better shot at winning them  Try to strike a good balance between preparing and being creepily prepared Your crush likes getting the extra attention you want to give them but they dont want to feel like youve been thinking about them every single second for the past three days Thats a bit creepy even if it might be true  Take deep breaths and practice letting your entire body go limp This is sometimes easier when you arent in public Try relaxing in your bed before going to sleep or when you get home or in the shower   You can get over your nervousness â or eliminate it altogether â by taking a moment to consider your options Practice at home before actually approaching your crush and you wont be caught in an awkward moment of silence Take your time especially if youre about to make a first impression on someone whos important to you   Practice in the mirror Youll want to make sure you know what youre going to say but dont make it sound rehearsed Imagine a variety of situations in which you might have the opportunity to talk to your crush and act these out in front of the mirror The more prepared you are the more confident youll be during the conversation itself Have fun with it Sure try the serious versions of what you want to say but also say it in a completely goofy way that makes you laugh The less serious you take yourself the more natural you will be when the time comes   Take the time to notice what pictures they have in their notebook or what they eat at lunch or which sports they like to play Knowing these small but important details will help you make conversation later on It could help you say something like   I noticed those movies on your notebook Im all about movies from the 80s Do you have a favorite Hey my friends and I were going to play some pickup after school Maybe youd want to join if youre up for it   One of the reasons youre probably afraid of being crushed is that it will hurt your confidence Dont let that happen Its crazy to let your confidence be swayed by just one person Much of your confidence should come from how you feel about yourself So find ways to boost your confidence before you really start getting to know your crush That way youll be more attractive to your crush and you wont be crushed if something bad happens   Look at your Facebook wall Studies have found that simply looking at your Facebook wall for 3 minutes can significantly boost your selfconfidenceIts worth a try Spend a little time with your dad Studies also show that kids who spend more time with their fathers during adolescence turn out to be more confident than those who spend lessNote Its probably best to hang out with your dad several hours before talking with your crush Its for the best   What does that mean It means put yourself in a position where you dont care whether your crush likes you back Why is this important Its important for two reasons It helps you deal with rejection which is ultimately something youre going to have to do If youre not getting rejected somewhere along the way youre not trying And secondly it helps you have a healthier relationship with your crush Instead of building the crush up to be a superhero who will save everything in your world you treat them like a normal but special person instead   What you say Why would I do that I dont even have control over it You may not But sometimes we think about our crushes so much and we imagine what life would be with them that we start to develop unhealthy relationships with their imaginary selves These imaginary relationships become so unhealthy that we cant imagine ourselves being without this person all without the other person even knowing If youre outcomeindependent your confidence grows This is attractive to a lot of people You dont feel that getting rejected from any one girl or any one guy is a big deal and so you shrug it off Your confidence is bigger than the rejection of one person   The first time you interact on a personal level should be in a casual situation without too many other people around to distract you The middle of the dance floor would not be great place to have a lengthy conversation for example   Go up to your crush during lunch time in the cafeteria Ask him or her if you can sit next to them and begin to strike up a conversation Its often honestly as simple as that Talk to your crush at a party Whether its a birthday party or a pool party if youre both invited you have an excuse to talk to them Interact with him or her through one of your mutual friends If youre friends with one of his friends go up to the friend and start talking waiting for him to give you something to say   If youve already formally introduced yourself then all you need to do is say a simple hi or hello Remember to look your crush directly into the eyes when you say hello Youre unintentionally saying a lot if you stare down at your shoes while saying hello   Ask thoughtprovoking things that relate to your current situationâwhy and how questions are typically best if you want to talk for awhile These often lead to indepth discussions that both of you can participate in which is ideal when talking to a crush   Remember to try to avoid simple yes or no questions If you ask your crush Did you go to school in Canada they dont have to give you a long answer If you ask your crush What was it like going to school in Canada theyll talk a lot more Ask them about their background Where are they from what do their parents do how do they know soandso etc People your crush included love talking about themselves   Meaning ask a few questions while heshe is telling the story This will show them that you are paying attention to what they have to say If you come up with a story to tell make sure your crush has finished talking before you begin and keep it short and sweet so your crush doesnt think youre full of yourself   Your body language communicates a lot whether or not you want it to Sometimes your body will says things you cant help But a lot of the time if youre aware of what your body is saying you can correct it if you ever notice it betraying you Heres what to pay attention to   Eyecontact Making and keeping eyecontact says that youre interested in what the other person is saying Face in their direction Face your body in their direction It means youre interested in what theyre saying and arent shy Smile Smiling says the other person makes you happy  Flirt with body language Especially if youre a girl Gently bat your eyelashes twirl your hair or touch their shoulder Laughing at their jokes Even if the jokes arent that funny smile and do your best to humor your crush   Whatever you do dont use pickup lines Theyre horribly cheesy and they dont really work If youre a guy and you cant think of what to use other than a pickup line read this article on how to start a conversation with a girl   Seriously If youre like a normal person being close to your crush is going to drive you insane And when you feel that way youre likely to do well stupid stuff Shrug it off If you trip over your words say something like Wow I cant speak I guess being close to a beautiful girl will do that If you trip over your shoes and he comes to pick you up asking Are you okay say something like Sure I really thought I nailed the landing   If you feel like the conversation is going well dont hesitate to ask when your crush is free again This can be anything from a couple of minutes at lunch tomorrow to a bona fide date with movie and dinner â your request will depend on how confident you feel and how your crush acts while youre talking   Once youve thought it through and you can tell they are interested in you dont worry about asking when you can see each other after this   You are not necessarily going to get a warm reception when you first try to initiate conversation If your crush seems disengaged or bored ask if anything is wrong maybe its been a bad day maybe theyve got something on their mind   If there doesnt appear to be anything distracting your crush and his or her annoyance with you still seems to be heightening excuse yourself politely make a quick escape and consider trying another day   Its possible that your crush just doesnt feel the same way about you If you determine that this is the case the two of you can still talk but you have to accept that a romantic relationship between you is unlikely   Theres nothing worse than feeling unrequited love for someone whos completely unaware of it so if your crush friendzones you just accept it and move on
Even if your intentions may be pure he will think youre returning his affections if you linger with him At this point his mind will be clouded and he will be focused on getting something out of the relationship he has with you Any action you perform that hints of romantic interest will only encourage him to continue even if you truly didnt mean anything  Avoid looking eager even if you secretly might be Responding to him or looking interested will only encourage him to continue and he might hurt you badly in the process  physically andor inwardly Be firm when telling him no and show negative feelings towards him if need be Dont be gentle or kind to him because hell take it the wrong way at this point   If it becomes obvious that he is interested in you ask him why he is playing around with you while he still has a girl Chances are he will tell you she is boring and he will claim he wants to break up with her for you However avoid falling for that He is only batting around with your feelings in order to persuade you into giving him what he wants   Note that he might deny it However keep your guard up and be on the alert for signs that he is flirting with you   Firmly tell yourself that he doesnt want you He is only using you for his own selfish needs Despite how intimate he may be with you he truly doesnt care about your feelings He only wants your body Although it might feel good at the start you will start to realize that youre only preparing yourself for a terrible crash He will start to detach from you and he will eventually leave you   You are no different To him youre just another girl whom he will use to get what he wants Although he might tell you otherwise he doesnt love you and you should avoid hurting yourself   Remember you are still young and you still have a chance to find someone who truly loves you Its best to keep yourself pure for the one who gives you unconditional love so that you wont have to show him the scars you could have avoided There will be plenty of guys who will rock your world and make you feel like the beautiful girl you already are   Think about the consequences even if there might not seem to be any at the moment Remember that you must stay true to yourself and you come first  not him Avoid scarring and wounding yourself by stepping into a horrible relationship like that Do something that your future self will thank you for   If worse comes to worse and he wont leave you alone approach a trustworthy adult and tell them about the situation before its too late You could also share your worries with your good friends but remember that they might not be able to help you or give you the best advice Dont count out your family  realize that they will possibly be the most supporting and helpful in this situation
